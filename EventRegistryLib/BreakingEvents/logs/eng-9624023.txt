With the deal, McCaffrey will remain the highest-paid running back on an average annual basis, receiving a roughly $3 million increase in yearly pay to keep him under contract through the 2027 season.\n\nMcCaffrey has been one of the best players in football and has arguably been the best skill position player in the league ever since the 49ers acquired him in a trade with the Carolina Panthers in October 2022. He had a career year in 2023, rushing for a league-high 1,459 yards on 5.4 yards per carry and 14 touchdowns to go with 67 receptions for 564 yards and seven touchdowns.\n\nThe dominant season from McCaffrey made him an MVP candidate for much of the year, as he made a push to be the first running back to win the award since 2012. He ultimately fell short, but did capture Offensive Player of the Year.\n\nMore importantly, McCaffrey was pivotal in the 49ers' push to return to the Super Bowl. He rushed for a combined 188 yards and four touchdowns in San Francisco's wins in the NFC Divisional Round and Championship games.\n\nWhile McCaffrey had 160 total yards of offense and a touchdown in Super Bowl LVIII, it wasn't enough for the 49ers to beat the Kansas City Chiefs, as they fell in overtime, 25-22.\n\nWith the extension, McCaffrey will likely remain in the Bay Area through the remainder of his prime years as he turns 28 on Friday. The deal also ensures that Brock Purdy will at least have one of his valuable targets around him for the foreseeable future.

A year ago, McCaffrey was a pace-setter and a tone-setter for the 49ers as they worked through quarterback Brock Purdy's post-surgical elbow issues.\n\nAs it stands, McCaffrey was scheduled to make $11.8 million in salary with a cap number of over $16 million on a contract extension negotiated in 2020. As the NFL's Offensive Player of the Year, McCaffrey led the league with 1,459 yards rushing to go along with 564 receiving and 21 total touchdowns.\n\nMcCaffrey was in line to be the 49ers' fifth highest-paid offensive player, trailing Aiyuk (should he get his extension), Deebo Samuel, George Kittle and Trent Williams.\n\nMcCaffrey and Nick Bosa are the players most often cited by teammates and coaches for their dedication and work ethic. Coach Kyle Shanahan said previously he's not worried about McCaffrey missing the voluntary sessions and this is what he said when Bosa was present but didn't participate in last year's minicamp:\n\nA source with knowledge of the situation confirmed McCaffrey was on-site but had no information regarding Aiyuk.\n\nAiyuk is scheduled to play under the fifth-year option of just over $14 million. Bosa was under a fifth-year option a year ago and reported to the mandatory minicamp although he didn't participate. Bosa eventually landed a five-year, $170 million deal with $122.5 guaranteed that temporarily made him the NFL's highest paid non-quarterback at an average per year of $34 million.\n\nThat figure was surpassed Monday when Minnesota wide receiver Justin Jefferson received a four-year, $140 million extension (35 million average) and it just happens to be at Aiyuk's position.\n\nThere have been a glut of big money contracts that have gone to wide receivers, including Detroit's Amon-Ra St. Brown, Philadelphia's A.J. Brown and Davonta Smith that range between $25 million and $30 million in average salary.\n\nAiyuk has steadily increased his production and last season caught 75 passes for 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns.", "source": {"uri": "chicoer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chico Enterprise-Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jerry_mcdonald@chicoer.com", "name": "Jerry Mcdonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_McCaffrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian McCaffrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Purdy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brock Purdy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kittle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Kittle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Bosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amon-Ra_St._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amon-Ra St. Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.

Mandatory Credit: Robert Edwards-USA TODAY Sports / Robert Edwards-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Offensive Player of the Year is back in the building.\n\nChristian McCaffrey has reported to 49ers mandatory minicamp according to reports. Had he not reported, the 49ers would have fined him. McCaffrey recently skipped the team's OTAs, which are voluntary, but there's speculation that he wants to renegotiate his contract which he signed with the Panthers in 2020.\n\nWhen asked why McCaffrey skipped OTAs, head coach Kyle Shanahan declined to explain, while running backs coach Bobby Turner said that McCaffrey's absence had to do with business.\n\nIt seems likely that McCaffrey is unhappy with his contract but not unhappy with the 49ers, so he sent them a subtle message without seeming emotional or greedy. If anyone asks why he missed OTAs, he can say he was preparing for his wedding, but the 49ers got the message. I'm guessing they'll give him some guaranteed money for this year and next year before the season starts.\n\nThe big question is whether Brandon Aiyuk will show up. Aiyuk has gone public with his displeasure that the 49ers haven't given him the contract extension he's looking for, and he skipped OTAs, too. I'm guessing he'll skip minicamp as well because that's what Nick Bosa did last year when he was negotiating an extension with the 49ers. And he still got his deal.\n\nSo if Aiyuk skips minicamp, that doesn't mean he's angry or that he hates the 49ers.

He also was a standout basketball player for Allentown Central Catholic High School, leading the school to Pennsylvania state titles in 1984 and 1986.\n\nUpon graduation, McCaffrey attended Stanford University, where he played college football for the Cardinal. He finished his Stanford career as the school's fifth all-time leader in receptions (146) and third all-time leader in receiving yards (2,333). He earned first-team All-America and All-Pac-10 Conference honors as a senior in 1990, catching 61 passes for 917 yards and eight touchdowns that season. McCaffrey was enshrined in Stanford's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nIn 1991 he was drafted by the New York Giants where he caught passes from Phill Simms and Jeff Hostetler before joining the 49ers in 1994 where he caught passes from Steve Young and played in Super Bowl XXIX.\n\nHe joined the Denver Broncos in 1995 and would spend the next eight years with the organization winning back-to-back Super Bowls in 1998 and 1999.\n\nWith the Broncos, he became a reliable target for quarterback John Elway, set a Broncos record for most receptions in a season at the time with 101 receptions in the 2000 season, and had an exceptional performance in Super Bowl XXXIII against the Atlanta Falcons, recording five catches for 72 yards. In 2000, McCaffrey and teammate Rod Smith became only the second wide receiver duo from the same team to each gain 100 receptions in the same season, matching a record by Detroit's Herman Moore and Brett Perriman.\n\n\"Life is great,\" McCaffrey said during an interview with the Herald/Review. \"Living the dream.\"\n\nWhile in high school McCaffrey said he had a lot of good teammates and coaches, many of whom he is still friends with today, but his main focus was getting good grades and working towards getting into a good college.\n\n\"I had an incredible high school experience,\" he said. \"People love their sports in Allentown, especially football but also basketball. I'm a big proponent of playing multiple sports, especially if you're in high school. I think it's important to play multiple sports, plus it also cross-trains your body that can help you become a better athlete.\"\n\nMcCaffrey said the student enrollment at the high school he attended was right around 1,000.\n\n\"We did have schools of different sizes there,\" he said. \"There were some really small schools that had 12 kids in it and then there were some that had a few hundred depending how far out of Allentown you got. There are a lot of small towns there in Pennsylvania you probably wouldn't have heard of unless you're from Pennsylvania.\"\n\nMcCaffrey and his wife Lisa have four sons, the most famous being Christian McCaffrey, the star running back for the San Francisco 49ers, who rushed for nearly 1,500 yards last year and finished third in MVP voting as he led his team to Super Bowl LVIII.\n\nAt Stanford, McCaffrey Jack Elway (John Elway's father) and then future Vikings and Cardinals head coach Denny Green.\n\nMcCaffrey says he struggled academically his freshman year and even had to enlist the help of a tutor and study extra hours.\n\n\"I really had to organize my time well because between college sports, which is very time-consuming and trying to take a very heavy workload academically, freshman year was rough for me,\" he said. \"Luckily I had a great support system and everyone helped me get up to speed that freshman year and by the time I entered my sophomore year I felt like I had a plan and had it figured out. You have to be very organized, you have to manage your time because it's precious. I think you have to be willing to ask for help. You're competing at a whole other level both academically and athletically so for me, it was about being organized and willing to ask for help. There are no dumb questions and don't let your ego get in the way of you asking for help.\"\n\nMcCaffrey was drafted in the third round of the 1991 NFL Draft by the Giants the year after they won the Super Bowl.\n\n\"I was the last pick of the third round,\" he said. \"Bill Parcels called me up; said he was the head coach of the New York Giants, told me they were going to draft me and gave me the dates for mini camp and said, hope to see you soon. It was not the red carpet treatment like you see today. I was very excited to be drafted. It was a dream come true for me. You're reminded real quick you have to make the team, however. I played three years there but then was cut by the Giants. In my three years there I went through three different head coaches.\"\n\nMcCaffrey said the first day of minicamp Parcells reminded everyone the Giants had just won the Super Bowl and he was hoping that maybe a few of us would make the team.\n\nFrom there he was invited to a tryout with the 49ers. He said he showed up to find out he was one of 14 receivers auditioning for four spots that were available, two of which were occupied by Jerry Rice and John Taylor who had won a couple of Super Bowls with San Francisco.\n\nHe and Nate Singleton made the team and were part of the 49ers Super Bowl win over the San Diego Chargers.\n\n\"I was only there seven months but as fate would have it we went on to win the Super Bowl beating the San Diego Chargers,\" he said. \"Steve Young was the quarterback of the team and got MVP that year and Deon Sanders got Defensive Player of the Year.\"\n\nAfter being released from the 49ers McCaffrey became a member of the Denver Broncos who were quarterbacked by John Elway and coached by Mike Shanhan.\n\nMcCaffrey won two Super Bowls with the Broncos.\n\nAfter being hampered by injuries during the 2003 season McCaffrey retired from the NFL in 2004.\n\nLooking back on his 13-year NFL career, McCaffrey said playing on three Super Bowl winning teams, it's hard picking which one as more special than the others.\n\n\"They were each different,\" he said. \"I had such great teammates and coaches. I really had a blessed career. It was never easy and kind of a roller coaster.\"\n\n\"I really didn't play with any bad quarterbacks, but John Elway was my favorite,\" he said. \"We won Super Bowl XXXII which was the first Super Bowl win in Broncos history. I got to dot that when we were there in victory formation. To see those smiles and the tears. That was my favorite moment of all time playing football. Those years with the Denver Broncos changed my entire life.\"\n\nAfter his playing career ended, McCaffrey took a foray into coaching, landing the head job at Northern Colorado University where he coached from 2019-2022. Among the players he coached there were his son Dylan, a quarterback. His son Luke, a 6-foot-2 receiver, played at Nebraska and Rice and was taken with the 100th pick in the 2024 NFL Draft by the Washington Commanders.\n\nToday, McCaffrey does speaking engagements and is the owner of a mustard and horseradish company.\n\n\"I've been selling mustard and horseradish since the 1990's,\" he said. \"I didn't know it would last this long but there are so many fans of the product.\"\n\nMcCaffrey is about to launch his own website called mccaffreybrands.com. One of the more popular mustards that he sells is the \"Rocky Mountain Spicy Brown Mustard''.\n\n\"We've never had a website until now,\" he said. \"It's just been sold here in Colorado and surrounding states. I'm excited to launch this website for the first time and I'm so thankful to everyone who has been buying our product since 1998.\"\n\nMcCaffrey and his wife also oversee the McCaffrey Family Foundation and he runs a football camp every June through the Boys and Girls Club in his area.\n\n\"We love helping out families and helping out children especially,\" he said. \"We have four boys and we know what a blessing it is to have them. We know families struggle to provide a great experience for them so we do the best we can to help them.\"\n\nMcCaffey said none of what he accomplished would have been possible were it not the support of his Lisa.\n\n\"The greatest thing I ever did was marry the right woman,\" he said. \"Lisa is so smart and funny. She's such an incredible mom. She got the lifestyle. Professional sports is so different. Unless you've lived it or know someone that has, it's hard to explain. You have to be fully invested to survive. Your whole life revolves around your training schedule and your commitment to the sport. You need someone in your life who is really understanding of what it takes to be successful in professional sports. Lisa did such an amazing job. She supported it, embraced it and did such an incredible job of raising our kids allowing me to focus on what I need to do to continue playing.\"\n\nWhat is NABUR?\n\nJoin the online forum", "source":

ESPN's Adam Schefter added that McCaffrey will receive an additional $8 million over what he was initially scheduled to make. NFL Network's Tom Pelissero said it'll be a $38 million extension.\n\nMcCaffrey was already the highest-paid running back in football on an annual basis. Now, he's $4 million higher than the next running back. That's quite the pay bump and a good reason for McCaffrey to show up to mandatory minicamp.\n\nMcCaffrey will be under contract through the 2027 season. It's a fantastic deal for him. In fairness, he earned it after an incredible season last year. We don't have the contract numbers yet, but the Niners are effectively ripping up the existing contract and paying McCaffrey roughly $15.55 million per year. So it'll read like a four-year contract for $62.2 million.\n\nPreviously, McCaffrey's total value on his existing deal was $64 million with $36 million guaranteed. The additional guarantees and when they kick in will impact how the contract reads.\n\nPer Over the Cap, the 49ers will save roughly $8.6 million in cap space over the next four years after this extension. So, it's a team-friendly deal in that sense, as they create room and keep their best player under contract.\n\nWe'll have more specifics about McCaffrey's deal soon.

DAILY POST reports that the State Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Chris Nehikhare, disclosed this in a statement made available to newsmen. The state government disclosed this on the heels of the ban on Okhaigeles (youth leaders) in the seven Local Government Areas that make up Edo South Senatorial District. DAILY POST reported that the ban of the Okhaigeles had led to a disagreement between the state government and the Palace of the Oba of Benin. While the state government insisted that there is no going back on the ban, the Palace of the Oba of Benin insisted that the Okhaigeles are part of the traditional institutions of the Benin Kingdom and cannot be banned by the government. Advancing reasons for the ban, the state government stated that \"some so-called youths\" on Friday, June 7, 2024, opened fire on three men of the Nigerian Army attached to Okomu Oil Palm Plc. in Ovia South West Local Government Area. Nehikhare said the soldiers were injured thereby throwing the community into pandemonium. He vowed that in the coming weeks, government would proceed on a full-scale operation to disarm the criminal elements and neutralize their threat against public peace. Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, had on June 4, 2024, while receiving the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Hassan Bala Abubakar, who was on a courtesy visit at the Government House, in Benin City, raised the alarm that the state government is having a running battle with bandits and terrorist. According to the governor, \"We have a few challenges like the one that relates to the maritime border, particularly the Ovia River axis where we have been having running battles with bandits and terrorists in the last few months.\" Obaseki stated that people are using the Ovia River to bring arms and engage in all sorts of nefarious activities. \"We need calm in that axis because we want to commence the development of the Benin River Port and it's important to guarantee the safety and security of our partners that will be working in that axis,\" he said. He called for more surveillance in the areas and solicited the support of the Nigerian Air Force in tackling insecurity in the locality. DAILY POST recall that three staff of Okomu Oil Palm Plc, were on Monday, May 6, 2024, killed by gunmen while working on the plantation.

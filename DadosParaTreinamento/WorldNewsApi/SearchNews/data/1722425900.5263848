Richard Hudson, NRCC chair: Biden&#x27;s poor debate performance will drag down House Democrats", "text": "The chairman of the House Republicans\u2019 campaign arm said President Biden was always the ticket to expanding the GOP\u2019s House majority. Rep. Richard Hudson, of North Carolina, when asked if Mr. Biden\u2019s widely panned debate performance against former President Donald Trump would help GOP House candidates this election cycle, said the president is \u201cunfit to be president.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been saying all along, this is the most unpopular president running for reelection in American history. He\u2019s a drag on House Democrats,\u201d the chairman of the NRCC told reporters. \u201cThe American people saw last night [he\u2019s unfit for office] \u2026 so I would be asking House Democrats, are you going to admit today that your president\u2019s not fit for office?\u201d Mr. Hudson, when asked if he was concerned that Democrats would switch out Mr. Biden for a more formidable nominee, said he didn\u2019t know how they would \u201cskirt the democratic process.\u201d \u201cAlso, I think it\u2019s very curious that no one\u2019s talking about Kamala Harris,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re all talking about alternatives to the African American female incumbent vice president who will be next in line.\u201d Rep. Marcus Molinaro, New York Republican who represents a swing district, told reporters that Democrats are planning to replace Mr. Biden in an effort to save down-ballot Democrats. \u201cI think there is now a coordinated effort among Democrats to replace Joe Biden. They might be able to attempt to distance themselves from the president, but they certainly can\u2019t distance themselves from the policies of the last four years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat the American people saw last night is what many Democrats thought and felt privately, and now we\u2019re witnessing this coordinated political equivalent of a drive-by shooting that they are engaged in this effort to both distance themselves and then ultimately throw the president under the bus.\u201d House Democrats have acknowledged Mr. Biden had a rough debate night when he faced off against Mr. Trump, failing to communicate several of his responses in a lucid manner, feeding into accusations that he is not cognitively fit for the job. However, they stood by the president, brushed off any calls to replace him and denied he was a drag on Democrats at the bottom of November\u2019s ticket. \u201cHe had a poor performance,\u201d said Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina. Mr. Clyburn added that he thinks Mr. Biden can serve another four years and urged the president to \u201cstay the course.\u201d House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Mr. Biden would not hurt the Democrats\u2019 goal of recapturing the House, but offered a lukewarm endorsement when asked if he thought Mr. Biden was the most effective person to communicate the party\u2019s agenda. \u201cI\u2019m going to reserve comment about anything relative to where we are at this moment other than to say I stand behind the ticket. I stand behind the Senate Democratic majority,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd of course, we\u2019re going to do everything that we need to do as House Democrats to win.\u201d", "summary": "The chairman of the House Republicans' campaign arm said President Biden was always the ticket to expanding the GOP's House majority.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/28/rep-richard-hudson-nrcc-chair-bidens-poor-debate-p/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2023/07/06/Election_2024_House_California_72021.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:16:31", "author": "Kerry Picket", "authors": ["Kerry Picket"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.409}

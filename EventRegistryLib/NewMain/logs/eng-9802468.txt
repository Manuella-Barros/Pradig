Kamala Harris has given a jolt of life to a Democratic Party that was meandering in a realm of hopelessness and despair. Harris' usurpation of the Biden presidency has allowed Democrats to raise money and give something their base can get excited about. These are all bad things. Donald Trump was cruising to a 1980-style beatdown of Joe Biden until July 21.\n\nThough a shoddy do-over candidate who was never really liked by Biden's staff due to her messy, uneven, and overall strangeness, she's now a major party candidate and has yet to take any questions from the media or hold a press conference. It's simple: the more she talks to the press off-script, the more danger she puts herself with voters -- she's a word salad queen. Instead, we've been hit with a river of press releases. For now, the media is content with this arrangement for now since she's been giving reporters access and speaking to them off the record (via Politico) [emphasis mine]:\n\nHarris' last formal television sit-down interview was on June 24, when she joined MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" to mark the anniversary of the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision that ended federal protections for abortion. Three days later, she appeared on CNN and spoke one-on-one with anchor ANDERSON COOPER less than an hour after Biden's disastrous debate performance, acknowledging that \"it was a slow start\" but confidently suggesting that the country should assess his performance in the office over three and a half years, not \"90 minutes on a debate stage.\"\n\nFor a vice president who arguably damaged herself most gravely with her June 2021 interview with \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor LESTER HOLT, Harris' determined on-air defense of Biden three years later -- which she came up with independent of the campaign team -- offered a template Biden and others would use to try to stop the political bleeding. While Biden's closest aides also viewed that interview as a true show of loyalty, some in Harris' orbit saw her confident and forceful responses to Cooper as proof of how far she's come.\n\nEver since Biden passed Harris the baton, news organizations have been pushing the vice president's team for a sit-down interview. According to two people familiar with the campaign's thinking, there are ongoing discussions about a joint interview with Harris and Walz prior to the convention, which begins on Aug. 19 in Chicago. But on the whole, Harris' top communications aides are deeply skeptical, as Biden's inner circle was, that doing big interviews with major TV networks or national newspapers offer much real upside when it comes to reaching swing voters.\n\nOne longtime Harris ally suggested to West Wing Playbook that Harris could hold off on big interviews until after Labor Day. \"There's really no need,\" the person said. \"The voters that she needs are at the local level. They're not reading the national press.\"\n\nWalz, whose viral cable TV appearances helped propel him onto the ticket, could be deployed on television more liberally than Harris in the coming months, the two people said. But it's also quite possible both candidates will focus much of their media outreach on podcasts, influencers and other platforms outside the traditional news media.\n\nSo far, Harris' rally speeches, delivered via teleprompter, have been well received. And she has routinely interacted with the reporters that travel with her -- but on her terms. She often visits with the press pool seated at the back of her plane (something Biden did just twice in more than three years), but speaking only off the record. And when she has chosen to comment on the record on something in the news, Harris has spoken to the pool on the tarmac, making statements but not taking questions.\n\n\"What is the incentive for her [to take more questions]?\" said another person close to the campaign who was granted anonymity to share how Harris' team views the matter. \"She's getting out exactly the message she wants to get out.\"\n\nWhat a ridiculous position; no one reads the national media. They're the reason why you're rising in the polls, Harris camp, as they've suffocated any negative story about any Democrat since the Republican Convention. And it's sophomoric to think that in running for the most powerful office in the free world, local interviews with outlets akin to the Bergen County Shopper's Guide would suffice as acceptable levels of media exposure. It's a sign that this operation is wholly directed by social media, which isn't real-life and provides the GOP an opportunity.\n\nAlso, not every media member is okay with this arrangement. It's not a substitute for pressers.

Ever since Joe Biden outmaneuvered members of his own party and folded his endorsement of Kamala Harris into his withdrawal announcement, it has all been positive forward momentum for the Harris campaign, and now the Harris-Walz campaign. The campaign is raising money like crazy, Harris's choice of Walz as her running mate was embraced across the Democratic Party spectrum and all of Harris's campaign stops and rallies are getting huge numbers. Enthusiasm is off the charts, the campaign has signed up thousands of volunteers and, perhaps best of all, it's completely thrown off Donald Trump and JD Vance. But the media needs a conflict, they need something to hold over Kamala Harris's head. They've settled on \"why isn't VP Harris giving interviews?!?\" From Politico:\n\nIntroducing Tim Walz gave the campaign millions in free media: The raucous crowd inside the arena in Philadelphia ate it up. And so did the cable networks, three of which carried the event live and uninterrupted for roughly 80 minutes, starting with another strong and closely watched speech from Pennsylvania Gov. JOSH SHAPIRO, the runner up for Harris' vice president nod. The free publicity -- or \"earned media,\" as operatives call it -- is worth millions, and it was reminiscent of the way cable networks carried countless hours of then-candidate DONALD TRUMP's campaign rallies in 2016.\n\nTrump isn't getting that kind of free media anymore: Eight years later, things have changed. Trump, now making his third run for the White House, is delivering his well-worn routine at rallies that only sporadically get live network coverage (the \"Right Side Broadcasting\" YouTube channel doesn't count). Now, Harris is the new, exciting thing in the race, her rallies delivering left-leaning MSNBC some of its highest ratings in weeks. And preliminary numbers showed that Tuesday's rally brought the network an audience that was more than double its four-week norm in the 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. hours.\n\nKamala isn't doing interviews right now: The Harris camp is hoping to ride the wave as long as it can. So there is little worry about the candidate avoiding something else that has long been required of presidential nominees: taking questions from the press. While some reporters and columnists have started to grumble about that, JD VANCE, Trump's running mate who is bracketing Harris and Walz on the road this week, tried on Wednesday to draw more attention to the matter.\n\nHer last interview was defending President Biden in June: On June 27, she appeared on CNN and spoke one-on-one with anchor ANDERSON COOPER less than an hour after Biden's disastrous debate performance, acknowledging that \"it was a slow start\" but confidently suggesting that the country should assess his performance in the office over three and a half years, not \"90 minutes on a debate stage.\"... Harris' determined on-air defense of Biden three years later -- which she came up with independent of the campaign team -- offered a template Biden and others would use to try to stop the political bleeding. While Biden's closest aides also viewed that interview as a true show of loyalty, some in Harris' orbit saw her confident and forceful responses to Cooper as proof of how far she's come.\n\nSkepticism: Ever since Biden passed Harris the baton, news organizations have been pushing the vice president's team for a sit-down interview. According to two people familiar with the campaign's thinking, there are ongoing discussions about a joint interview with Harris and Walz prior to the convention, which begins on Aug. 19 in Chicago. But on the whole, Harris' top communications aides are deeply skeptical, as Biden's inner circle was, that doing big interviews with major TV networks or national newspapers offer much real upside when it comes to reaching swing voters. One longtime Harris ally suggested to West Wing Playbook that Harris could hold off on big interviews until after Labor Day. \"There's really no need,\" the person said. \"The voters that she needs are at the local level. They're not reading the national press.\"\n\n[From Politico]\n\nThere's more at Politico - even the suggestion that Harris is dependent on a Teleprompter, because airhead women, amirite - but the broad strokes are here. Kamala's people don't see an upside and I don't blame them. She's always gotten an exceptionally raw deal in the mainstream political press, and she just watched what those same people did to Joe Biden. I would say \"f-k 'em forever and let them die mad\" but I know she won't. She and Tim Walz will probably do an interview together before the convention and she'll do some TV interviews in the fall. But just so we're clear... this is a controversy being created by the media, and the longer Harris holds off on \"giving an interview,\" the ruder and more unpleasant these people will get.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baton (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labor Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Media", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802468", "eventUri": "eng-9802468", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 2564, "textEnd": 2571}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "textStart": 3620, "textEnd": 3627}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

In the 18 days since, Harris has:\n\nNow here's what Kamala Harris hasn't done in the last 18 days:\n\nI mentioned this earlier today in an update to my analysis of Harris playing footsie with a pro-Palestinian activist group on an Israeli arms embargo. Her flack Phil Gordon insisted that Harris opposed an arms embargo, but there's no evidence of it on the record. All Gordon could offer was ambiguous language from pre-nominee Harris defending Israel's right to defend itself, which most pointedly does not include any promise to sustain the means of that self-defense.\n\nIn fact, there's no evidence anywhere of Kamala Harris' post-nomination agenda or policy positions. Nominally, everyone assumes that Harris will incorporate the previous Biden agenda and positions, but that's only an assumption. If voters go to Harris' campaign website, they'll find plenty of ways to send cash to the Harris-Walz effort ... and no reason why they should:\n\nNotice that the site has the bios for both candidates, an updated events section, and even a swag store for further funding of the campaign. What it doesn't have -- at all -- is an Issues or Policy section. There's literally no way for voters to find out what the Harris-Walz agenda is or will be, not even just a copy-paste from the old Biden website.\n\nOne would think that the media, even the Protection Racket Media version in place these days, would get a little suspicious about this lack of information and engagement. Harris has stiffed them for almost three weeks since winning the nomination, refusing to publicly engage with them for their readers and viewers. Don't they even have a financial interest in getting that kind of content, let alone a moral and ethical interest in speaking truth to power and holding officials accountable, etc etc?\n\nAs it turns out, there's a reason why the media hasn't made a stink about the Silence of the Kams. At least for now, they're in on it. Politico Playbook spilled the beans on the nasty little secret among reporters assigned to Harris -- they're letting her talk off the record:\n\nEver since Biden passed Harris the baton, news organizations have been pushing the vice president's team for a sit-down interview. According to two people familiar with the campaign's thinking, there are ongoing discussions about a joint interview with Harris and Walz prior to the convention, which begins on Aug. 19 in Chicago. But on the whole, Harris' top communications aides are deeply skeptical, as Biden's inner circle was, that doing big interviews with major TV networks or national newspapers offer much real upside when it comes to reaching swing voters. ...\n\nSo far, Harris' rally speeches, delivered via teleprompter, have been well received. And she has routinely interacted with the reporters that travel with her -- but on her terms. She often visits with the press pool seated at the back of her plane (something Biden did just twice in more than three years), but speaking only off the record. And when she has chosen to comment on the record on something in the news, Harris has spoken to the pool on the tarmac, making statements but not taking questions.\n\n\"What is the incentive for her [to take more questions]?\" said another person close to the campaign who was granted anonymity to share how Harris' team views the matter. \"She's getting out exactly the message she wants to get out.\"\n\nAnd apparently, the media is getting out the message they want to get out, too. This isn't reporting or journalism; it's Stenogralism, as I called it the other day. By being complicit in this, the reporters on the Harris-Walz campaign have ceased being journalists at all. They are either activists working to get her elected and passing along the message of the day, or they are engaged in stenography for the campaign to curry favor.\n\nThat quote alone should humiliate every \"reporter\" in the Harris pool. It should stick to their careers for decades, and would ... if their editors and executives weren't also on board with their Stenogralism.\n\nImagine if they decided to stop and demand on-the-record questions and answers. Would Harris kick them all off the plane? Of course not. She needs them more than they need her, even if the Stenogralists don't realize it. Harris can only operate this scam because they allow it. They are enabling Harris to run an utterly substance-less campaign.\n\nThis is almost worse than \"fake news.\" It's a complete sell-out by institutional media to sitting public officials and also candidates for higher office. We often talk about the coming crisis in media, but baby, it has arrived.. We need to gather as many allies as possible to keep important issues in the public square - in this case, any of the issues -- and to preserve the public square at all.\n\nJoin us in the fight.

Donald Trump held a press conference today, and has been doing media interviews all along. How many of these media outlets will note the contrast and demand similar engagement from the Democrat ticket? A few reporters are starting to wonder that publicly. Trump also offered three debates to Harris, including the ABC News debate that Joe Biden negotiated. Will Harris accept? Trump expressed some skepticism about that because Harris hasn't done an interview, and as Trump said, can't do an interview.\n\nOne has to wonder what Harris is hiding. And for that matter, what the media is hiding.\n\nJames Carville thinks he knows why she's hiding.

Harris has only been in an unscripted scenario once since then when she rambled about \"the importance of having a president who understands the power of diplomacy and understands the strength that rests in understanding the significance of diplomacy.\"\n\nAs Politico revealed, Harris hiding from the media is all part of the strategy. Harris's team thinks speaking to national media publicly is a bad idea, but Harris has been speaking to her press pool on her plane \"often\" when off the record. Harris has no intention of taking public questions from anyone because, as someone close to her campaign told the outlet, \"She's getting out exactly the message she wants to get out.\"\n\nYou can see that best with her decision to make Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) her running mate. Walz does not believe in freedom of speech and exaggerated his military service record to further his political career, including using it to justify his opposition to the Second Amendment. Similar to Harris, Walz is ignoring questions about his record.\n\nBoth of them know it doesn't matter. A fawning liberal media apparatus consisting of CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, the New York Times, the Washington Post, and others are all on their side, and everyone knows it.

Her campaign is only going to last just over 100 days, and Harris wants to ride the liberal media enthusiasm to the end to avoid showing everyone just how terrible she is when she isn't reading from a script.\n\nHarris is relying on liberal media's shameless partisanship to do all the work of \"getting out exactly the message she wants to get out\" so she can avoid self-destructing like Biden did on the debate stage.

Perhaps hold a press conference? Answer our questions?\n\nThe new Democratic nominee has not done an extended interview since June 24, three days before the fateful debate that knocked her boss out of the presidential race and paved the way for her historic candidacy. Harris appeared on MSNBC's Morning Joe, which frankly is not like entering the lion's den.\n\nWhen the Democrats switched out President Joe Biden for his understudy, they hoped they were getting a more skilled communicator of the party's message. That faith has been borne out thus far: Harris's rallies feel more like pop concerts -- admittedly because they often are -- than funerals, and she delivers her attacks on former President Donald Trump with considerably more vigor than the octogenarian she replaced.\n\nBut the reticence about putting the Democratic standard-bearer in unscripted settings has continued despite the youth revolution at the top of the ticket. We know that Harris can read well from a teleprompter and at least some of her staff can meme. What about answering tough questions? While nimbler than Biden, it is in exactly these scenarios that Harris's last presidential campaign unraveled.\n\n\"One longtime Harris ally suggested to West Wing Playbook that Harris could hold off on big interviews until after Labor Day,\" Politico reported.\n\nThere is plenty to ask Harris about. In addition to a scrubbing of her policy portfolio as vice president, Harris's campaign has walked back, often anonymously, issue positions the candidate took in person and frequently on camera. Can she explain, or even confirm, the shifts?\n\nYes, it is important for the country to hear from the woman who might be president in an unfiltered manner. It will help inform the voters' decisions to remove any confusion about where she stands on matters of public concern.\n\nBut it is just as important for the credibility of the media to appear at least a little bit curious about Harris's positions. The past few weeks have been like an experiment about what happens when major media institutions remove their layers of protection from the Democratic presidential candidate. Once the debate appeared to doom his election chances, Biden faced as hostile a press as any Democrat not under indictment in recent memory. Then, as soon as he dropped out, Harris received almost uniformly glowing coverage.\n\nThe contrast was stunning. Conservatives have complained about liberal media bias for decades, dating back to at least the Nixon administration. The noticeable shift in tone from Biden's candidacy to Harris's seemed almost designed to confirm the charge.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nIt is understandable the Democratic base would be relieved and elated to have a better chance in the presidential contest.

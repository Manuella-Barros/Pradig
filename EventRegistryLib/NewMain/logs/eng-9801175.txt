City Interest, Reports AS", "body": "Real Madrid star Rodrygo isn't interested in the prospect of joining Manchester City and wants to fight for his place at the Bernabeu according to AS, which cited anonymous sources.\n\nCity has cash to spend following the sale of Julian Alvarez to Los Blancos' crosstown rivals Atletico Madrid.\n\nAccording to The Athletic, the deal for the Qatar 2022 World Cup winner with Argentina could be worth of up to $108 million (\u20ac95 million) while also leaveing City with a vacant spot in attack.\n\nRodrygo has been on the Mancunians' radar for some time, and angered the Madrid fanbase by calling Pep Guardiola's men the \"best team in the world\".\n\nEven so, AS explains that Rodrygo is \"not considering going to Manchester even if Guardiola calls him personally to try to convince him\".\n\nCity has attempted to lure Rodrygo on several occasions, but he sees his \"present and future\" in the Spanish capital and doesn't want to hear about offers from elsewhere according to anonymous sources.\n\nRather than feel threatened by the arrivals of potential positional rivals Kylian Mbappe and Endrick, Rodrygo is happy and feels that his achievements since joining from boyhood club Santos in 2019 - which includes two Champions League titles - are recognised by his employers with whom he has a long-term contract until 2028.\n\nOne of his biggest backers is of course head coach Carlo Ancelotti, who in lieu of an out-and-out striker after the departure of Karim Benzema to Saudi Arabia, fielded the forward alongside fellow winger Vinicius Jr. in a front two last term.\n\nIt has been suspected by many that Mbappe's presence would result in reduced playing time for Rodrygo as Ancelotti reverts to a 4-3-3 and Jude Bellingham maintains his 'false 9' role.\n\nOn the contrary, however, a new tactical system will find a way accommodate all three of Mbappe, Rodyrg, and Vinicius up top while Bellingham drops to a deeper midfield assignment that he more commonly took on before joining Madrid from Borussia Dortmund in 2023.\n\nThis isn't to say that Rodrygo might not eventually get squeezed out or have a change of heart.\n\nFor now, though, he wants to continue making history in the iconic white shirt of the reigning Spanish and European champions.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [],

The Brazil international is on course to be touted to the reigning Premier League champions after being forced to contend with Kylian Mbappe's arrival. Pep Guardiola has set his sights on making two additions to his Manchester City squad ahead of the transfer deadline.\n\nManchester City are set to be handed a quickfire opportunity to fill the void left by the outgoing Julian Alvarez as Real Madrid are seriously considering offering Rodrygo to the reigning Premier League champions as they seek an Etihad Stadium replacement, GIVEMESPORT sources have revealed.\n\nAlthough Sky Blues boss Pep Guardiola bolstered his attacking options by completing the \u00a330million signing of Savinho in the aftermath of playing a crucial role in helping Girona to Champions League qualification last term, the Spanish tactician has given the green-light for a big-money departure.\n\nAlvarez is on the brink of sealing a switch worth up to \u00a382million to Atletico Madrid, having also agreed personal terms ahead of undergoing a medical, but Manchester City - whose recruitment drive is being led by director of football Txiki Begiristain - are in the market for reinforcements ahead of the August 30 transfer deadline.\n\nSky Blues Poised to be Handed Chance to Recruit Rodrygo Brazil international has fallen down pecking order at Real Madrid\n\nThere is an increasing expectation that Rodrygo is on course to be offered to Manchester City, according to GMS sources, as Alvarez's impending move to Real Madrid's rivals has resulted in last season's Champions League winners spotting a potential window of opportunity to offload the 23-year-old.\n\nAlthough the wide forward still has four years remaining on his Bernabeu contract, which includes a release clause worth in the region of \u00a3840million, the La Liga heavyweights are open to cashing in and are aware that the Sky Blues are one of few European clubs with the ability to meet his wage demands.\n\nGMS sources have been informed that Rodrygo is eager to fight for his place in Real Madrid head coach Carlo Ancelotti's plans, despite the likes of Kylian Mbappe providing further competition heading into the new season, but Manchester City are poised to have a chance to reach an agreement as they look to replace Alvarez.\n\nRodrygo's statistical averages per 90 minutes during the 2023/24 domestic campaign compared to Julian Alvarez\n\nRodrygo\n\nJulian Alvarez\n\nShot-creating actions\n\n4.20\n\n4.01\n\nShots\n\n3.26\n\n3.27\n\nKey

when they landed the Brazil international from Santos in June 2018, while he was still a teenager, but adjustments to their squad have resulted in him falling down the pecking order and having limited game time prospects with the 2024/25 campaign a matter of days away.\n\nManchester City are in the market for two more signings as the transfer deadline looms, GMS sources have learned, with Guardiola keen to bring in an attacking threat - in reaction to Alvarez's imminent switch to Atletico Madrid - and a defensive midfielder capable of providing cover for Rodri.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Rodrygo has scored four goals and registered one assist over the course of seven appearances against Manchester City in the Champions League\n\nGuardiola Will Consider Landing Rodrygo if Opportunity Opens Up Neto and Eze have also been on champions' shortlist of targets\n\nAlthough Manchester City may find it difficult to convince Rodrygo to embark on a fresh challenge due to his decision not to actively seek a move away from Real Madrid, GMS sources have been told that Guardiola will consider upping the ante if the opportunity genuinely opens up in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Sky Blues have had the likes of Wolverhampton Wanderers talisman Pedro Neto and Crystal Palace playmaker Eberechi Eze on their shortlist of potential recruits, but neither are currently on course to arrive at the Etihad Stadium and that has resulted in the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich chief keeping his options open.\n\nRodrygo has lifted silverware on 11 occasions during his time in the Spanish capital, including the Champions League twice, and Guardiola is aware that he would be landing an attacking threat who already knows what it takes to come into a side battling for trophies on a regular basis and make an impact.\n\nRelated Joao Felix 'Not a Target' for Man City Amid Aston Villa Interest\n\nAston Villa are still the ones to watch in the race for Joao Felix.\n\nManchester City potentially turning their attentions towards the South American will be music to Crystal Palace's ears as GMS sources recently revealed that the decision to sell Alvarez has left their domestic rivals concerned that they were poised to respond by knocking for Eze's signature.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of FBref and Transfermarkt", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The problem this creates for Rodrygo is that teammate Vinicius Junior is virtually undroppable.\n\nThe Brazilian is a candidate to win this year's Ballon d'Or, and although he is likely to miss out on the prestigious award to Manchester City midfielder and favourite Rodri, the South American remains one of Europe's most prolific wide-attackers.\n\nAnd that could force Rodrygo to take on a more squad-focused and rotational role -- something he has not yet experienced at the Santiago Bernabeu after making 53 La Liga starts in the past two seasons.\n\nConsequently, and likely to welcome the challenge of playing in the Premier League, Rodrygo has been linked with a high profile transfer to two of England's biggest clubs.\n\nIn addition to Liverpool, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City are also credited with having an interest. The Cityzens are on lookout for an attacking replacement for Atletico Madrid-bound Julian Alvarez after the Argentine agreed a transfer worth a reported \u00a382 million (\u20ac90 million).\n\nReal Madrid are believed to value Rodrygo at \u00a377.5 million (\u20ac90 million) and could begin negotiations for their number 11 before the close of the summer transfer window.", "source": {"uri": "caughtoffside.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CaughtOffside"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_walker@caughtoffside.com", "name": "Andrew Walker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart\u00edn_Zubimendi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mart\u00edn Zubimendi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Sociedad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Sociedad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santos FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Education and Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real_Estate", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Real Estate", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://icdn.caughtoffside.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cadiz-cf-v-real-madrid-cf-laliga-ea-sports.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801175", "eventUri": "eng-9801175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

If a good offer arrives, they will be forced to accept it. But they have a plan in case that happens.\n\n'Florentino believes that if Rodrygo leaves, the attack positions are well covered. With Vinicius and Mbapp\u00e9 fixed, Ancelotti would continue to have Arda G\u00fcler, Endrick and Brahim as companions. Not bad.\n\n'That's why if Rodrygo Florentino P\u00e9rez leaves, it's very clear who will go with the money he receives: Rodri Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\n'The midfielder of the Spanish national team and Manchester City is Florentino P\u00e9rez's big dream. He believes that he would fit perfectly into the team and that he would take one of the best footballers in the world. National talent to end the song that Madrid only signs foreigners.\n\n'It would also be a blow to City, which Florentino already considers his great rival in Europe. The president believes that the midfielder is the main position to be reinforced, and that Rodri is the best there. With Rodrygo's money, Madrid would have no problem facing the operation, and the soccer player would be tempted to return to his country and play for the European champion.'", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_ford@football365.com", "name": "Will Ford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentino_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florentino P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Neto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Neto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahim_D\u00edaz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brahim D\u00edaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arda_Turan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arda Turan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2x51gyc4ptf2q.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F08%2F08140150%2FF365-Two-Badges-Rodrygo-Silva-Rodri-Manchester-City-Real-Madrid.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801175", "eventUri": "eng-9801175", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

That's a tiny fraction of the $63 billion Navy procurement budget proposed by President Joe Biden's administration for 2025.\n\nMilitary sea drones can range from missile-armed speed boats to minehunting miniature submarines and solar-powered sailboats equipped with high-definition spy cameras, underwater sensors and loudspeakers used to holler warnings at enemy ships.\n\nBut when the Navy has deployed sea drones on reconnaissance missions in recent years, it hasn't always had the fleet expertise to use them, the two Navy sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThere aren't enough Navy sailors trained to pilot drones or to analyze vast swathes of data sent back from the craft's cameras and sensors, the sources said.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Navy was in the process of improving its data collection and analysis from sensors.\n\nPentagon spokesman Pahon said the DoD has been \"laser-focused on accelerating innovation over the last three years\", including the use of sea drones.\n\nAcknowledging budget challenges, Pahon said the Pentagon was using innovative ways to cross \"the valley of death\", a term used to describe the torturous approval process new inventions travel through to be purchased in large quantities.\n\nREPLICATOR\n\nOne example Pahon cited was the Replicator program: the short-term, $500 million-a-year project is designed to cut through bureaucracy and fast-track the deployment of thousands of cheap aerial and sea drones.\n\nThese drones will be used to match China's rapidly-growing air and naval power in the Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon's Hicks said at the project's launch in August. She said Replicator is being funded mainly by reallocating funds from the existing Pentagon budget.\n\nAs part of the initiative, the Pentagon in January issued a solicitation for private companies to deliver small sea drones to the Navy, demanding a production capacity of 120 vessels per year, with deployment beginning in April 2025.\n\nOn Monday, the Pentagon said the Switchblade-600, an aerial loitering munition made by AeroVironment Inc, was the first weapon publicly confirmed to be included in the Replicator initiative. The program's first tranche also includes undisclosed maritime surface products, other aerial drones and counter-drone systems (c-UAS), the Pentagon said.\n\nDuane Fotheringham, president of unmanned systems at Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, acknowledged the Pentagon and Navy had shown their \"intent\" to accelerate the deployment of sea drones but he said the industry wanted to see long-term funding in the defense budget.\n\n\"We hear the demand signal ... but we all have to work together very closely to understand what that demand is and when it will be available,\" Fotheringham told Reuters.\n\nAt a cost ranging between $1 million and $3 million apiece, according to Navy and defense contractor sources, drones offer a relatively cheap and fast way to expand the Navy's fleet, especially as several large traditional shipbuilding projects - like a new class of frigate warships - are running years behind schedule.\n\nThe U.S. is testing using robot ships in active combat scenarios. But their more immediate use is for missions that are too costly and numerous for manned naval fleets.\n\nThis includes maritime surveillance, minehunting, and protecting critical undersea infrastructure, like gas pipelines and fiber-optic cables, four drone companies told Reuters.\n\nSwarms of small sea drones could also act as a shield for valuable crewed assets like aircraft carriers and submarines, and tangle up troop-carrying ships in the event China tries to invade Taiwan, said Bryan Clark, an advisor to the Navy on autonomous craft and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute - a think tank headquartered in Washington.\n\nClark estimates the Navy has around 100 small drones for use on the ocean surface and another 100 underwater drones, while China has a similar-sized autonomous force that is growing fast. The Navy spokesperson declined to comment on how many drones it has in operation.\n\n\"Ukraine has shown how effective they can be and how they can be employed in current operations,\" Clark said. \"The U.S. Navy needs to embrace that lesson and field combat (sea drones) right away.\"\n\nThe Navy's 5th fleet, which operates out of Bahrain, has been testing unmanned vessels for three years, led by its Task Force 59 unit.\n\nThe project has deployed surveillance drones built by private firms, including startups, as well as those backed by defense heavyweights like Lockheed Martin and HII.\n\n\"The situation in the Red Sea gives the work of Task Force 59 added urgency and we look forward to fielding solutions to help counter Houthi malign behaviour,\" Colin Corridan, commander of the task force, told Reuters.\n\nMISSILE TEST\n\nIn October, the Navy carried out its first live missile test from an unmanned speedboat in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe T38 Devil Ray, built by Florida-based sea drone firm MARTAC, successfully launched a miniature missile system to destroy a target boat, with a human operator ashore giving the order, according to a Navy announcement and video.\n\nMARTAC's Chief Marketing Officer, Stephen Ferretti, referred questions about the operation to the Navy.\n\nThe use of unmanned vessels was expanded to the Navy's 4th Fleet in central America last year where they have been used to crack down on human smuggling off the northern coast of Haiti.\n\nOne of the companies operating there is Saildrone, a California-based firm that makes wind-, solar- and diesel-powered autonomous vessels that collect images and data with cameras and sensors.\n\nSaildrone has circumnavigated Washington's funding politics. Because the company operates and maintains its own vessels, and charges a service fee for the data they collect, the Navy can pay to use the drones out of its operating expenses rather than procurement budget.\n\nSaildrone launched the Surveyor, its largest vessel, which has been tailored for the military, at an event in March attended by Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti.\n\nThe drone firm, which also supplies coast guards and ocean survey departments, has a fleet of 130 vessels and is building several more every month, said Richard Jenkins, the company's founder.\n\n\"Right now, we are struggling to keep up with demand,\" Jenkins told Reuters in an interview. He declined to comment on how much Saildrone charges the Navy.\n\nOcean Aero builds the autonomous Triton vessel, which can move on the surface or underwater to collect data and hunt for mines using sensors. The company, which is backed by Lockheed Martin, opened a 63,000 feet manufacturing facility in Gulfport, Mississippi last October that is capable of churning out 150 Tritons a year.\n\nLockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHII was awarded a contract last October to build nine small underwater drones for the U.S. Navy's Lionfish program, with the potential for this to rise to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The contract could total $347 million, although that is far from guaranteed.\n\nThe Lionfish program - which is focused on the Indo-Pacific where the U.S. is vying for control with China - is based on HII's Remus 300, a minehunting drone that can be launched like a torpedo from a crewed ship or submarine.\n\nThese programs are proof that the Pentagon is trying to move faster to deploy sea drones, spokesman Pahon told Reuters.\n\n\"We know we need to keep pushing to stay ahead,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"},

That's a tiny fraction of the $63 billion Navy procurement budget proposed by President Joe Biden's administration for 2025.\n\nMilitary sea drones can range from missile-armed speed boats to minehunting miniature submarines and solar-powered sailboats equipped with high-definition spy cameras, underwater sensors and loudspeakers used to holler warnings at enemy ships.\n\nBut when the Navy has deployed sea drones on reconnaissance missions in recent years, it hasn't always had the fleet expertise to use them, the two Navy sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThere aren't enough Navy sailors trained to pilot drones or to analyze vast swathes of data sent back from the craft's cameras and sensors, the sources said.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Navy was in the process of improving its data collection and analysis from sensors.\n\nPentagon spokesman Pahon said the DoD has been \"laser-focused on accelerating innovation over the last three years\", including the use of sea drones.\n\nAcknowledging budget challenges, Pahon said the Pentagon was using innovative ways to cross \"the valley of death\", a term used to describe the torturous approval process new inventions travel through to be purchased in large quantities.\n\nREPLICATOR\n\nOne example Pahon cited was the Replicator program: the short-term, $500 million-a-year project is designed to cut through bureaucracy and fast track the deployment of thousands of cheap aerial and sea drones.\n\nThese drones will be used to match China's rapidly-growing air and naval power in the Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon's Hicks said at the project's launch in August. She said Replicator is being funded mainly by reallocating funds from the existing Pentagon budget.\n\nAs part of the initiative, the Pentagon in January issued a solicitation for private companies to deliver small sea drones to the Navy, demanding production capacity of 120 vessels per year, with deployment beginning in April 2025.\n\nOn Monday, the Pentagon said the Switchblade-600, an aerial loitering munition made by AeroVironment Inc, was the first weapon publicly confirmed to be included in the Replicator initiative. The program's first tranche also includes undisclosed maritime surface products, other aerial drones and counter-drone systems (c-UAS), the Pentagon said.\n\nDuane Fotheringham, president of unmanned systems at Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, acknowledged the Pentagon and Navy had shown their \"intent\" to accelerate the deployment of sea drones but he said the industry wanted to see long-term funding in the defense budget. \"We hear the demand signal ... but we all have to work together very closely to understand what that demand is and when it will be available,\" Fotheringham told Reuters. At a cost ranging between $1 million and $3 million apiece, according to Navy and defense contractor sources, drones offer a relatively cheap and fast way to expand the Navy's fleet, especially as several large traditional shipbuilding projects - like a new class of frigate warships - are running years behind schedule. The U.S. is testing using robot ships in active combat scenarios. But their more immediate use is for missions that are too costly and numerous for manned naval fleets. This includes maritime surveillance, minehunting, and protecting critical undersea infrastructure, like gas pipelines and fiber-optic cables, four drone companies told Reuters. Swarms of small sea drones could also act as a shield for valuable crewed assets like aircraft carriers and submarines, and tangle up troop-carrying ships in the event China tries to invade Taiwan, said Bryan Clark, an advisor to the Navy on autonomous craft and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute - a think tank headquartered in Washington.Clark estimates the Navy has around 100 small drones for use on the ocean surface and another 100 underwater drones, while China has a similar-sized autonomous force that is growing fast. The Navy spokesperson declined to comment on how many drones it has in operation. \"Ukraine has shown how effective they can be and how they can be employed in current operations,\" Clark said. \"The U.S. Navy needs to embrace that lesson and field combat (sea drones) right away.\" The Navy's 5th fleet, which operates out of Bahrain, has been testing unmanned vessels for three years, led by its Task Force 59 unit.\n\nThe project has deployed surveillance drones built by private firms, including startups, as well as those backed by defense heavyweights like Lockheed Martin and HII. \"The situation in the Red Sea gives the work of Task Force 59 added urgency and we look forward to fielding solutions to help counter Houthi malign behaviour,\" Colin Corridan, commander of the task force, told Reuters. MISSILE TEST In October, the Navy carried out its first live missile test from an unmanned speedboat in the Arabian Peninsula. The T38 Devil Ray, built by Florida-based sea drone firm MARTAC, successfully launched a miniature missile system to destroy a target boat, with a human operator ashore giving the order, according to a Navy announcement and video. MARTAC's Chief Marketing Officer, Stephen Ferretti, referred questions about the operation to the Navy. The use of unmanned vessels was expanded to the Navy's 4th Fleet in central America last year where they have been used to crack down on human smuggling off the northern coast of Haiti. One of the companies operating there is Saildrone, a California-based firm that makes wind-, solar- and diesel-powered autonomous vessels that collect images and data with cameras and sensors. Saildrone has circumnavigated Washington's funding politics. Because the company operates and maintains its own vessels, and charges a service fee for the data they collect, the Navy can pay to use the drones out of its operating expenses rather than procurement budget. Saildrone launched the Surveyor, its largest vessel, which has been tailored for the military, at an event in March attended by Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti. The drone firm, which also supplies coast guards and ocean survey departments, has a fleet of 130 vessels and is building several more every month, said Richard Jenkins, the company's founder. \"Right now, we are struggling to keep up with demand,\" Jenkins told Reuters in an interview. He declined to comment on how much Saildrone charges the Navy. Ocean Aero builds the autonomous Triton vessel, which can move on the surface or underwater to collect data and hunt for mines using sensors. The company, which is backed by Lockheed Martin, opened a 63,000 feet manufacturing facility in Gulfport, Mississippi last October that is capable of churning out 150 Tritons a year. Lockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment. HII was awarded a contract last October to build nine small underwater drones for the U.S. Navy's Lionfish program, with the potential for this to rise to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The contract could total $347 million, although that is far from guaranteed. The Lionfish program - which is focused on the Indo-Pacific where the U.S. is vying for control with China - is based on HII's Remus 300, a minehunting drone that can be launched like a torpedo from a crewed ship or submarine. These programs are proof that the Pentagon is trying to move faster to deploy sea drones, spokesman Pahon told Reuters. \"We know we need to keep pushing to stay ahead,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Joe

The U.S. is floundering. | Technology", "body": "These tactics have caught the attention of the Pentagon, which is incorporating lessons from Ukraine and the Red Sea into its plans to counter China's rising naval power in the Pacific, Pentagon Spokesman Eric Pahon told Reuters. In a signal of the Pentagon's intent, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced an initiative in August - named Replicator - to deploy hundreds of small, relatively cheap air and sea drones within the next 18-24 months to match China's growing military threat.\n\nThe U.S. Navy's efforts to build a fleet of unmanned vessels are faltering because the Pentagon remains wedded to big shipbuilding projects, according to some officials and company executives, exposing a weakness as sea drones reshape naval warfare. The lethal effectiveness of sea drones has been demonstrated in the Black Sea where Ukraine has deployed remote-controlled speed boats packed with explosives to sink Russian frigates and minesweepers since late 2022.\n\nYemeni-backed Houthi rebels have employed similar vessels against commercial shipping in the Red Sea in recent months, albeit without success. These tactics have caught the attention of the Pentagon, which is incorporating lessons from Ukraine and the Red Sea into its plans to counter China's rising naval power in the Pacific, Pentagon Spokesman Eric Pahon told Reuters.\n\nIn a signal of the Pentagon's intent, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced an initiative in August - named Replicator - to deploy hundreds of small, relatively cheap air and sea drones within the next 18-24 months to match China's growing military threat. This public show of commitment masks years of hesitation by the U.S. Navy to build a fleet of unmanned vessels despite repeated warnings this was the future of maritime warfare, according to interviews with a dozen people with direct knowledge of the U.S. sea drone plans, including Navy officers, Pentagon officials, and sea drone company executives.\n\nTwo Navy sources and three executives at sea drone manufacturers said the biggest impediment to progress has been a Department of Defense (DoD) budget process that prioritizes big ships and submarines built by legacy defense contractors. \"At some point, you hit the D.C. problem,\" said Philipp Stratmann, CEO at Ocean Power Technologies (OPT), a New Jersey-based firm that supplies the U.S. Navy with the WAM-V, an autonomous surface drone.\n\n\"You hit the fact that there is a military industrial complex that has the best lobbyists and knows exactly how the money flows and contracting works in the DOD.\" A Navy spokesperson said it \"acquires capabilities based on fleet demand signals\", referring to the messages headquarters receive from commanders at sea.\n\nThe Navy has a budget of $172 million this year for small and medium-sized underwater sea drones, falling to $101.8 million in 2025, the spokesperson said. That's a tiny fraction of the $63 billion Navy procurement budget proposed by President Joe Biden's administration for 2025. Military sea drones can range from missile-armed speed boats to minehunting miniature submarines and solar-powered sailboats equipped with high-definition spy cameras, underwater sensors and loudspeakers used to holler warnings at enemy ships.\n\nBut when the Navy has deployed sea drones on reconnaissance missions in recent years, it hasn't always had the fleet expertise to use them, the two Navy sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. There aren't enough Navy sailors trained to pilot drones or to analyze vast swathes of data sent back from the craft's cameras and sensors, the sources said.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Navy was in the process of improving its data collection and analysis from sensors. Pentagon spokesman Pahon said the DoD has been \"laser-focused on accelerating innovation over the last three years\", including the use of sea drones.\n\nAcknowledging budget challenges, Pahon said the Pentagon was using innovative ways to cross \"the valley of death\", a term used to describe the torturous approval process new inventions travel through to be purchased in large quantities. REPLICATOR\n\nOne example Pahon cited was the Replicator program: the short-term, $500 million-a-year project is designed to cut through bureaucracy and fast track the deployment of thousands of cheap aerial and sea drones. These drones will be used to match China's rapidly-growing air and naval power in the Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon's Hicks said at the project's launch in August. She said Replicator is being funded mainly by reallocating funds from the existing Pentagon budget.\n\nAs part of the initiative, the Pentagon in January issued a solicitation for private companies to deliver small sea drones to the Navy, demanding production capacity of 120 vessels per year, with deployment beginning in April 2025. On Monday, the Pentagon\n\nsaid the Switchblade -600, an aerial loitering munition made by AeroVironment Inc , was the first weapon publicly confirmed to be included in the Replicator initiative. The program's first tranche also includes undisclosed maritime surface products, other aerial drones and counter-drone systems (c-UAS), the Pentagon said.\n\nDuane Fotheringham, president of unmanned systems at Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, acknowledged the Pentagon and Navy had shown their \"intent\" to accelerate the deployment of sea drones but he said the industry wanted to see long-term funding in the defense budget. \"We hear the demand signal ... but we all have to work together very closely to understand what that demand is and when it will be available,\" Fotheringham told Reuters.\n\nAt a cost ranging between $1 million and $3 million apiece, according to Navy and defense contractor sources, drones offer a relatively cheap and fast way to expand the Navy's fleet, especially as several large traditional shipbuilding projects - like a new class of frigate warships - are running years behind schedule. The U.S. is testing using robot ships in active combat scenarios. But their more immediate use is for missions that are too costly and numerous for manned naval fleets.\n\nThis includes maritime surveillance, minehunting, and protecting critical undersea infrastructure, like gas pipelines and fiber-optic cables, four drone companies told Reuters. Swarms of small sea drones could also act as a shield for valuable crewed assets like aircraft carriers and submarines, and tangle up troop-carrying ships in the event China tries to invade Taiwan, said Bryan Clark, an advisor to the Navy on autonomous craft and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute - a think tank headquartered in Washington.\n\nClark estimates the Navy has around 100 small drones for use on the ocean surface and another 100 underwater drones, while China has a similar-sized autonomous force that is growing fast. The Navy spokesperson declined to comment on how many drones it has in operation. \"Ukraine has shown how effective they can be and how they can be employed in current operations,\" Clark said. \"The U.S. Navy needs to embrace that lesson and field combat (sea drones) right away.\"\n\nThe Navy's 5th fleet, which operates out of Bahrain, has been testing unmanned vessels for three years, led by its Task Force 59 unit. The project has deployed surveillance drones built by private firms, including startups, as well as those backed by defense heavyweights like Lockheed Martin and HII.\n\n\"The situation in the Red Sea gives the work of Task Force 59 added urgency and we look forward to fielding solutions to help counter Houthi malign behaviour,\" Colin Corridan, commander of the task force, told Reuters. MISSILE TEST\n\nIn October, the Navy carried out its first live missile test from an unmanned speedboat in the Arabian Peninsula. The T38 Devil Ray, built by Florida-based sea drone firm MARTAC, successfully launched a miniature missile system to destroy a target boat, with a human operator ashore giving the order, according to a Navy announcement and video.\n\nMARTAC's Chief Marketing Officer, Stephen Ferretti, referred questions about the operation to the Navy. The use of unmanned vessels was expanded to the Navy's 4th Fleet in central America last year where they have been used to crack down on human smuggling off the northern coast of Haiti.\n\nOne of the companies operating there is Saildrone, a California-based firm that makes wind-, solar- and diesel-powered autonomous vessels that collect images and data with cameras and sensors. Saildrone has circumnavigated Washington's funding politics. Because the company operates and maintains its own vessels, and charges a service fee for the data they collect, the Navy can pay to use the drones out of its operating expenses rather than procurement budget.\n\nSaildrone launched the Surveyor, its largest vessel, which has been tailored for the military, at an event in March attended by Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti. The drone firm, which also supplies coast guards and ocean survey departments, has a fleet of 130 vessels and is building several more every month, said Richard Jenkins, the company's founder.\n\n\"Right now, we are struggling to keep up with demand,\" Jenkins told Reuters in an interview. He declined to comment on how much Saildrone charges the Navy. Ocean Aero builds the autonomous Triton vessel, which can move on the surface or underwater to collect data and hunt for mines using sensors. The company, which is backed by Lockheed Martin, opened a 63,000 feet manufacturing facility in Gulfport, Mississippi last October that is capable of churning out 150 Tritons a year.\n\nLockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment. HII was awarded a contract last October to build nine small underwater drones for the U.S. Navy's Lionfish program, with the potential for this to rise to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The contract could total $347 million, although that is far from guaranteed.\n\nThe Lionfish program - which is focused on the Indo-Pacific where the U.S. is vying for control with China - is based on HII's Remus 300, a minehunting drone that can be launched like a torpedo from a crewed ship or submarine. These programs are proof that the Pentagon is trying to move faster to deploy sea drones, spokesman Pahon told Reuters.\n\n\"We know we need to keep pushing to stay ahead,\" he said.\n\n(This story

Because the company operates and maintains its own vessels, and charges a service fee for the data they collect, the Navy can pay to use the drones out of its operating expenses rather than procurement budget.\n\nSaildrone launched the Surveyor, its largest vessel, which has been tailored for the military, at an event in March attended by Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti.\n\nThe drone firm, which also supplies coast guards and ocean survey departments, has a fleet of 130 vessels and is building several more every month, said Richard Jenkins, the company's founder.\n\n\"Right now, we are struggling to keep up with demand,\" Jenkins told Reuters in an interview. He declined to comment on how much Saildrone charges the Navy.\n\nOcean Aero builds the autonomous Triton vessel, which can move on the surface or underwater to collect data and hunt for mines using sensors. The company, which is backed by Lockheed Martin, opened a 63,000 feet manufacturing facility in Gulfport, Mississippi last October that is capable of churning out 150 Tritons a year.\n\nLockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHII was awarded a contract last October to build nine small underwater drones for the U.S. Navy's Lionfish program, with the potential for this to rise to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The contract could total $347 million, although that is far from guaranteed.\n\nThe Lionfish program - which is focused on the Indo-Pacific where the U.S. is vying for control with China - is based on HII's Remus 300, a minehunting drone that can be launched like a torpedo from a crewed ship or submarine.\n\nThese programs are proof that the Pentagon is trying to move faster to deploy sea drones, spokesman Pahon told Reuters.\n\n\"We know we need to keep pushing to stay ahead,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors":

In the eight or so months since, there's been scant details on how it would be funded and what exactly would be procured.\n\nHicks partially answered both questions with a statement Monday, saying that the first items in Replicator's shopping cart would include AeroVironment's Switchblade-600 loitering munition, a batch of uncrewed surface vehicles and another unspecified set of counter-drone systems.\n\nThe maritime vehicles are a part of a solicitation from the Defense Innovation Unit -- a Pentagon group that scouts high-tech weaponry -- published this year. These production-ready, inexpensive, maritime expeditionary, or PRIME, systems are meant to transit hundreds of miles, wait for a target and then intercept it. The Pentagon will award \"several\" contracts for the drone this summer, according to the statement.\n\nThe PRIME contract relies on an authority that makes it easier for the Defense Department to work with commercial companies, and which it used often to buy protective gear during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTwo senior defense officials, briefing reporters Sunday on the condition of anonymity, would not describe Replicator systems in further detail. The statement said other maritime and counter-drone systems in this first buy were classified.\n\nThe second question to this point has been funding. Earlier this year, Hicks said the program would split $1 billion between fiscal years 2024 and 2025. The total for FY24 would come from a $300 million reprogramming request -- essentially getting Congress' permission to move around existing money -- and another $200 million the Pentagon had already secured.\n\nOn the call Sunday, one of the defense officials said some of the $200 million bucket comes from money left around from previous years and some of it comes from separate reprogramming requests, which the military services are now sending Congress. There's also money in the massive national security supplemental passed in April that could aid Replicator.\n\n\"It gives us some optionality,\" the official said of that new bill.\n\nThe $500 million for FY25 won't involve shifting money around. It's included in the Pentagon's budget request, rolled out this March, but not on a specified line.\n\nReplicator overall has two goals. The first is to fast-track these drones with a focus on countering China. And the second is to learn a new way of business for the Pentagon, one future leaders can repeat to rush in other systems.\n\nBoth goals, according to the defense officials, are moving according to plan. They wouldn't share dollar figures, nor the number of systems being purchased in this round -- meant to be one of many before next August.\n\nFor this first batch of systems, the second defense official said that the Pentagon increased manufacturing capacity \"three-to-eight times.\"\n\nThe officials didn't say when there would be a second round of buys for Replicator but did say the next systems will likely feature similar sorts of drones, software and \"enablers,\" such as command and control and autonomy.\n\nThe goal, said the first defense official is to make sure not only that the Pentagon can meet its purchasing goals but also make sure the systems are ready when they arrive. To that end, the Defense Department is developing concepts of operation, gathering data, and reviewing the systems to make sure they meet the Pentagon's ethical and policy guidelines, said the first official.\n\nThey're also working with Congress, where some lawmakers have been frustrated at the scarcity of details surrounding the program. The officials said that so far they've held 30 \"engagements\" about the program with Capitol Hill, along with more one-on-one meetings.\n\n\"We're still learning,\" the first official said. \"Replicator is about pushing the boundaries.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicator_(Star_Trek)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Replicator (Star Trek)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loitering_munition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loitering munition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Innovation_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defense Innovation Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Deputy_Secretary_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Deputy Secretary of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal protective equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Command and control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/P7HLWkBWEEBD_NsSKSGhwg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/defense_news_499/a5aac8dfabd45b4d8bb19b3711f488ef", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542409", "eventUri": "eng-9542409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

(Photo: Brandon Murphy / U.S. Army)\n\nA Navy spokesperson said it \"acquires capabilities based on fleet demand signals\", referring to the messages headquarters receive from commanders at sea.\n\nThe Navy has a budget of $172 million this year for small and medium-sized underwater sea drones, falling to $101.8 million in 2025, the spokesperson said. That's a tiny fraction of the $63 billion Navy procurement budget proposed by President Joe Biden's administration for 2025.\n\nMilitary sea drones can range from missile-armed speed boats to minehunting miniature submarines and solar-powered sailboats equipped with high-definition spy cameras, underwater sensors and loudspeakers used to holler warnings at enemy ships.\n\nBut when the Navy has deployed sea drones on reconnaissance missions in recent years, it hasn't always had the fleet expertise to use them, the two Navy sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThere aren't enough Navy sailors trained to pilot drones or to analyze vast swathes of data sent back from the craft's cameras and sensors, the sources said.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Navy was in the process of improving its data collection and analysis from sensors.\n\nPentagon spokesman Pahon said the DoD has been \"laser-focused on accelerating innovation over the last three years\", including the use of sea drones.\n\nAcknowledging budget challenges, Pahon said the Pentagon was using innovative ways to cross \"the valley of death\", a term used to describe the torturous approval process new inventions travel through to be purchased in large quantities.\n\nReplicator\n\nOne example Pahon cited was the Replicator program: the short-term, $500 million-a-year project is designed to cut through bureaucracy and fast track the deployment of thousands of cheap aerial and sea drones.\n\nThese drones will be used to match China's rapidly-growing air and naval power in the Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon's Hicks said at the project's launch in August. She said Replicator is being funded mainly by reallocating funds from the existing Pentagon budget.\n\nAs part of the initiative, the Pentagon in January issued a solicitation for private companies to deliver small sea drones to the Navy, demanding production capacity of 120 vessels per year, with deployment beginning in April 2025.\n\nDuane Fotheringham, president of unmanned systems at Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, acknowledged the Pentagon and Navy had shown their \"intent\" to accelerate the deployment of sea drones but he said the industry wanted to see long-term funding in the defense budget.\n\n\"We hear the demand signal ... but we all have to work together very closely to understand what that demand is and when it will be available,\" Fotheringham told Reuters.\n\nAt a cost ranging between $1 million and $3 million apiece, according to Navy and defense contractor sources, drones offer a relatively cheap and fast way to expand the Navy's fleet, especially as several large traditional shipbuilding projects - like a new class of frigate warships - are running years behind schedule.Rendering of a HII Remus unmanned underwater vehicle (Image: HII)\n\nThe U.S. is testing using robot ships in active combat scenarios. But their more immediate use is for missions that are too costly and numerous for manned naval fleets.\n\nThis includes maritime surveillance, minehunting, and protecting critical undersea infrastructure, like gas pipelines and fiber-optic cables, four drone companies told Reuters.\n\nSwarms of small sea drones could also act as a shield for valuable crewed assets like aircraft carriers and submarines, and tangle up troop-carrying ships in the event China tries to invade Taiwan, said Bryan Clark, an advisor to the Navy on autonomous craft and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute - a think tank headquartered in Washington.\n\nClark estimates the Navy has around 100 small drones for use on the ocean surface and another 100 underwater drones, while China has a similar-sized autonomous force that is growing fast. The Navy spokesperson declined to comment on how many drones it has in operation.\n\n\"Ukraine has shown how effective they can be and how they can be employed in current operations,\" Clark said. \"The U.S. Navy needs to embrace that lesson and field combat (sea drones) right away.\"\n\nThe Navy's 5th fleet, which operates out of Bahrain, has been testing unmanned vessels for three years, led by its Task Force 59 unit.\n\nThe project has deployed surveillance drones built by private firms, including startups, as well as those backed by defense heavyweights like Lockheed Martin and HII.\n\n\"The situation in the Red Sea gives the work of Task Force 59 added urgency and we look forward to fielding solutions to help counter Houthi malign behavior,\" Colin Corridan, commander of the task force, told Reuters.\n\nMissile test\n\nIn October, the Navy carried out its first live missile test from an unmanned speedboat in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe T38 Devil Ray, built by Florida-based sea drone firm MARTAC, successfully launched a miniature missile system to destroy a target boat, with a human operator ashore giving the order, according to a Navy announcement and video.\n\nMARTAC's Chief Marketing Officer, Stephen Ferretti, referred questions about the operation to the Navy.\n\nA MARTAC T-38 Devil Ray unmanned surface vessel, attached to U.S. 5th Fleet's Task Force 59, sails in the Arabian Gulf, Oct. 26, 2023 (Photo: Jacob Vernier / U.S. Navy)\n\nThe use of unmanned vessels was expanded to the Navy's 4th Fleet in central America last year where they have been used to crack down on human smuggling off the northern coast of Haiti.\n\nOne of the companies operating there is Saildrone, a California-based firm that makes wind-, solar- and diesel-powered autonomous vessels that collect images and data with cameras and sensors.\n\nSaildrone has circumnavigated Washington's funding politics.

He declined to comment on how much Saildrone charges the Navy.\n\nA next-gen Saildrone Surveyor USV (Photo: Saildrone)\n\nOcean Aero builds the autonomous Triton vessel, which can move on the surface or underwater to collect data and hunt for mines using sensors.

(Colin Demarest/C4ISRNET)\n\nThe Pentagon released its clearest picture yet of Replicator, an ambitious program to field thousands of drones by next August.\n\nDeputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced the goal late last summer. In the eight or so months since, there's been scant details on how it would be funded and what exactly would be procured.\n\nHicks partially answered both questions with a statement Monday, saying that the first items in Replicator's shopping cart would include AeroVironment's Switchblade-600 loitering munition, a batch of uncrewed surface vehicles and another unspecified set of counter-drone systems.\n\nThe maritime vehicles are a part of a solicitation from the Defense Innovation Unit -- a Pentagon group that scouts high-tech weaponry -- published this year. These production-ready, inexpensive, maritime expeditionary, or PRIME, systems are meant to transit hundreds of miles, wait for a target and then intercept it. The Pentagon will award \"several\" contracts for the drone this summer, according to the statement.\n\nThe PRIME contract relies on an authority that makes it easier for the Defense Department to work with commercial companies, and which it used often to buy protective gear during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTwo senior defense officials, briefing reporters Sunday on the condition of anonymity, would not describe Replicator systems in further detail. The statement said other maritime and counter-drone systems in this first buy were classified.\n\nThe second question to this point has been funding. Earlier this year, Hicks said the program would split $1 billion between fiscal years 2024 and 2025. The total for FY24 would come from a $300 million reprogramming request -- essentially getting Congress' permission to move around existing money -- and another $200 million the Pentagon had already secured.\n\nOn the call Sunday, one of the defense officials said some of the $200 million bucket comes from money left around from previous years and some of it comes from separate reprogramming requests, which the military services are now sending Congress. There's also money in the massive national security supplemental passed in April that could aid Replicator.\n\n\"It gives us some optionality,\" the official said of that new bill.\n\nThe $500 million for FY25 won't involve shifting money around. It's included in the Pentagon's budget request, rolled out this March, but not on a specified line.\n\nReplicator overall has two goals. The first is to fast-track these drones with a focus on countering China. And the second is to learn a new way of business for the Pentagon, one future leaders can repeat to rush in other systems.\n\nBoth goals, according to the defense officials, are moving according to plan. They wouldn't share dollar figures, nor the number of systems being purchased in this round -- meant to be one of many before next August.\n\nFor this first batch of systems, the second defense official said that the Pentagon increased manufacturing capacity \"three-to-eight times.\"\n\nThe officials didn't say when there would be a second round of buys for Replicator but did say the next systems will likely feature similar sorts of drones, software and \"enablers,\" such as command and control and autonomy.\n\nThe goal, said the first defense official is to make sure not only that the Pentagon can meet its purchasing goals but also make sure the systems are ready when they arrive. To that end, the Defense Department is developing concepts of operation, gathering data, and reviewing the systems to make sure they meet the Pentagon's ethical and policy guidelines, said the first official.\n\nThey're also working with Congress, where some lawmakers have been frustrated at the scarcity of details surrounding the program. The officials said that so far they've held 30 \"engagements\" about the program with Capitol Hill, along with more one-on-one meetings.\n\n\"We're still learning,\" the first official said. \"Replicator is about pushing the boundaries.\"", "source": {"uri": "defensenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Defense News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "noah_robertson@defensenews.com", "name": "Noah Robertson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Hicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicator_(Star_Trek)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Replicator (Star Trek)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Deputy_Secretary_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Deputy Secretary of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loitering_munition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loitering munition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Innovation_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defense Innovation Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceflight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spaceflight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal protective equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Command and control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.defensenews.com/resizer/IaQzu-co3cS_SeiDj2S1t7_FoJ4=/1024x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/archetype/IDG7U5ZUIFC2DFYBDHG5S4NOOU.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542409", "eventUri": "eng-9542409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

The two-year program aims to integrate drones and technological innovations into defense programs at an accelerated pace.\n\nThe Switchblade-600 is the first disclosed weapon in the program, but more tranches and systems are expected. The first tranche also includes undisclosed maritime surface products, other aerial drones and counter-drone systems (c-UAS).\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed it has $500 million in funding to support Replicator in fiscal year 2024, including about $300 million from the recently passed defense appropriations bill, in addition to funds siphoned from other defense accounts. For 2025, the Pentagon has requested about $500 million to continue the second year of Replicator.\n\nThis move underscores the Pentagon's commitment to strengthening the U.S. military's technological edge, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, according to Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.\n\nAeroVironment, based in Simi Valley, California, is expected to scale up production to meet the Department's requirements. The initiative also represents a broader strategy to diversify the defense industrial base by incorporating both traditional and non-traditional companies.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington.

That's a tiny fraction of the $63 billion Navy procurement budget proposed by President Joe Biden's administration for 2025.\n\nMilitary sea drones can range from missile-armed speed boats to minehunting miniature submarines and solar-powered sailboats equipped with high-definition spy cameras, underwater sensors and loudspeakers used to holler warnings at enemy ships.\n\nBut when the Navy has deployed sea drones on reconnaissance missions in recent years, it hasn't always had the fleet expertise to use them, the two Navy sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThere aren't enough Navy sailors trained to pilot drones or to analyze vast swathes of data sent back from the craft's cameras and sensors, the sources said.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Navy was in the process of improving its data collection and analysis from sensors.\n\nPentagon spokesman Pahon said the DoD has been \"laser-focused on accelerating innovation over the last three years\", including the use of sea drones.\n\nAcknowledging budget challenges, Pahon said the Pentagon was using innovative ways to cross \"the valley of death\", a term used to describe the torturous approval process new inventions travel through to be purchased in large quantities.\n\nREPLICATOR\n\nOne example Pahon cited was the Replicator program: the short-term, $500 million-a-year project is designed to cut through bureaucracy and fast track the deployment of thousands of cheap aerial and sea drones.\n\nThese drones will be used to match China's rapidly-growing air and naval power in the Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon's Hicks said at the project's launch in August. She said Replicator is being funded mainly by reallocating funds from the existing Pentagon budget.\n\nAs part of the initiative, the Pentagon in January issued a solicitation for private companies to deliver small sea drones to the Navy, demanding production capacity of 120 vessels per year, with deployment beginning in April 2025.\n\nDuane Fotheringham, president of unmanned systems at Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, acknowledged the Pentagon and Navy had shown their \"intent\" to accelerate the deployment of sea drones but he said the industry wanted to see long-term funding in the defense budget.\n\n\"We hear the demand signal ... but we all have to work together very closely to understand what that demand is and when it will be available,\" Fotheringham told Reuters.\n\nAt a cost ranging between $1 million and $3 million apiece, according to Navy and defense contractor sources, drones offer a relatively cheap and fast way to expand the Navy's fleet, especially as several large traditional shipbuilding projects - like a new class of frigate warships - are running years behind schedule.\n\nThe U.S. is testing using robot ships in active combat scenarios. But their more immediate use is for missions that are too costly and numerous for manned naval fleets.\n\nThis includes maritime surveillance, minehunting, and protecting critical undersea infrastructure, like gas pipelines and fiber-optic cables, four drone companies told Reuters.\n\nSwarms of small sea drones could also act as a shield for valuable crewed assets like aircraft carriers and submarines, and tangle up troop-carrying ships in the event China tries to invade Taiwan, said Bryan Clark, an advisor to the Navy on autonomous craft and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute - a think tank headquartered in Washington.\n\nClark estimates the Navy has around 100 small drones for use on the ocean surface and another 100 underwater drones, while China has a similar-sized autonomous force that is growing fast. The Navy spokesperson declined to comment on how many drones it has in operation.\n\n\"Ukraine has shown how effective they can be and how they can be employed in current operations,\" Clark said. \"The U.S. Navy needs to embrace that lesson and field combat (sea drones) right away.\"\n\nThe Navy's 5th fleet, which operates out of Bahrain, has been testing unmanned vessels for three years, led by its Task Force 59 unit.\n\nThe project has deployed surveillance drones built by private firms, including startups, as well as those backed by defense heavyweights like Lockheed Martin and HII.\n\n\"The situation in the Red Sea gives the work of Task Force 59 added urgency and we look forward to fielding solutions to help counter Houthi malign behaviour,\" Colin Corridan, commander of the task force, told Reuters.\n\nMISSILE TEST\n\nIn October, the Navy carried out its first live missile test from an unmanned speedboat in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe T38 Devil Ray, built by Florida-based sea drone firm MARTAC, successfully launched a miniature missile system to destroy a target boat, with a human operator ashore giving the order, according to a Navy announcement and video.\n\nMARTAC's Chief Marketing Officer, Stephen Ferretti, referred questions about the operation to the Navy.\n\nThe use of unmanned vessels was expanded to the Navy's 4th Fleet in central America last year where they have been used to crack down on human smuggling off the northern coast of Haiti.\n\nOne of the companies operating there is Saildrone, a California-based firm that makes wind-, solar- and diesel-powered autonomous vessels that collect images and data with cameras and sensors.\n\nSaildrone has circumnavigated Washington's funding politics. Because the company operates and maintains its own vessels, and charges a service fee for the data they collect, the Navy can pay to use the drones out of its operating expenses rather than procurement budget.\n\nSaildrone launched the Surveyor, its largest vessel, which has been tailored for the military, at an event in March attended by Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti.\n\nThe drone firm, which also supplies coast guards and ocean survey departments, has a fleet of 130 vessels and is building several more every month, said Richard Jenkins, the company's founder.\n\n\"Right now, we are struggling to keep up with demand,\" Jenkins told Reuters in an interview. He declined to comment on how much Saildrone charges the Navy.\n\nOcean Aero builds the autonomous Triton vessel, which can move on the surface or underwater to collect data and hunt for mines using sensors. The company, which is backed by Lockheed Martin, opened a 63,000 feet manufacturing facility in Gulfport, Mississippi last October that is capable of churning out 150 Tritons a year.\n\nLockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHII was awarded a contract last October to build nine small underwater drones for the U.S. Navy's Lionfish program, with the potential for this to rise to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The contract could total $347 million, although that is far from guaranteed.\n\nThe Lionfish program - which is focused on the Indo-Pacific where the U.S. is vying for control with China - is based on HII's Remus 300, a minehunting drone that can be launched like a torpedo from a crewed ship or submarine.\n\nThese programs are proof that the Pentagon is trying to move faster to deploy sea drones, spokesman Pahon told Reuters.\n\n\"We know we need to keep pushing to stay ahead,\" he said.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 6, 2024", "source":

Because the company operates and maintains its own vessels, and charges a service fee for the data they collect, the Navy can pay to use the drones out of its operating expenses rather than procurement budget.\n\nSaildrone launched the Surveyor, its largest vessel, which has been tailored for the military, at an event in March attended by Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti.\n\nThe drone firm, which also supplies coast guards and ocean survey departments, has a fleet of 130 vessels and is building several more every month, said Richard Jenkins, the company's founder.\n\n\"Right now, we are struggling to keep up with demand,\" Jenkins told Reuters in an interview. He declined to comment on how much Saildrone charges the Navy.\n\nOcean Aero builds the autonomous Triton vessel, which can move on the surface or underwater to collect data and hunt for mines using sensors. The company, which is backed by Lockheed Martin, opened a 63,000 feet manufacturing facility in Gulfport, Mississippi last October that is capable of churning out 150 Tritons a year.\n\nLockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHII was awarded a contract last October to build nine small underwater drones for the U.S. Navy's Lionfish program, with the potential for this to rise to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The contract could total $347 million, although that is far from guaranteed.\n\nThe Lionfish program - which is focused on the Indo-Pacific where the U.S. is vying for control with China - is based on HII's Remus 300, a minehunting drone that can be launched like a torpedo from a crewed ship or submarine.\n\nThese programs are proof that the Pentagon is trying to move faster to deploy sea drones, spokesman Pahon told Reuters.\n\n\"We know we need to keep pushing to stay ahead,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The US is floundering", "body": "The US Navy's efforts to build a fleet of unmanned vessels are faltering because the Pentagon remains wedded to big shipbuilding projects, according to some officials and company executives, exposing a weakness as sea drones reshape naval warfare.\n\nThe lethal effectiveness of sea drones has been demonstrated in the Black Sea where Ukraine has deployed remote-controlled speed boats packed with explosives to sink Russian frigates and minesweepers since late 2022.\n\nYemeni-backed Houthi rebels have employed similar vessels against commercial shipping in the Red Sea in recent months, albeit without success.\n\nThese tactics have caught the attention of the Pentagon, which is incorporating lessons from Ukraine and the Red Sea into its plans to counter China's rising naval power in the Pacific, Pentagon Spokesman Eric Pahon told Reuters.\n\nIn a signal of the Pentagon's intent, Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks announced an initiative in August - named Replicator - to deploy hundreds of small, relatively cheap air and sea drones within the next 18-24 months to match China's growing military threat.\n\nThis public show of commitment masks years of hesitation by the US Navy to build a fleet of unmanned vessels despite repeated warnings this was the future of maritime warfare, according to interviews with a dozen people with direct knowledge of the US sea drone plans, including Navy officers, Pentagon officials, and sea drone company executives.\n\nTwo Navy sources and three executives at sea drone manufacturers said the biggest impediment to progress has been a Department of Defense (DoD) budget process that prioritises big ships and submarines built by legacy defence contractors.\n\n\"At some point, you hit the D.C. problem,\" said Philipp Stratmann, CEO at Ocean Power Technologies (OPT), a New Jersey-based firm that supplies the US Navy with the WAM-V, an autonomous surface drone.\n\n\"You hit the fact that there is a military industrial complex that has the best lobbyists and knows exactly how the money flows and contracting works in the DOD.\"\n\nA Navy spokesperson said it \"acquires capabilities based on fleet demand signals\", referring to the messages headquarters receive from commanders at sea.\n\nThe Navy has a budget of $172 million this year for small and medium-sized underwater sea drones, falling to $101.8 million in 2025, the spokesperson said. That's a tiny fraction of the $63 billion Navy procurement budget proposed by President Joe Biden's administration for 2025.\n\nMilitary sea drones can range from missile-armed speed boats to minehunting miniature submarines and solar-powered sailboats equipped with high-definition spy cameras, underwater sensors and loudspeakers used to holler warnings at enemy ships.\n\nBut when the Navy has deployed sea drones on reconnaissance missions in recent years, it hasn't always had the fleet expertise to use them, the two Navy sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThere aren't enough Navy sailors trained to pilot drones or to analyse vast swathes of data sent back from the craft's cameras and sensors, the sources said.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Navy was in the process of improving its data collection and analysis from sensors.\n\nPentagon spokesman Pahon said the DoD has been \"laser-focused on accelerating innovation over the last three years\", including the use of sea drones.\n\nAcknowledging budget challenges, Pahon said the Pentagon was using innovative ways to cross \"the valley of death\", a term used to describe the torturous approval process new inventions travel through to be purchased in large quantities.\n\nREPLICATOR\n\nOne example Pahon cited was the Replicator program: the short-term, $500 million-a-year project is designed to cut through bureaucracy and fast track the deployment of thousands of cheap aerial and sea drones.\n\nThese drones will be used to match China's rapidly-growing air and naval power in the Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon's Hicks said at the project's launch in August. She said Replicator is being funded mainly by reallocating funds from the existing Pentagon budget.\n\nAs part of the initiative, the Pentagon in January issued a solicitation for private companies to deliver small sea drones to the Navy, demanding production capacity of 120 vessels per year, with deployment beginning in April 2025.\n\nDuane Fotheringham, president of unmanned systems at Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), the largest US military shipbuilder, acknowledged the Pentagon and Navy had shown their \"intent\" to accelerate the deployment of sea drones but he said the industry wanted to see long-term funding in the defence budget.\n\n\"We hear the demand signal ... but we all have to work together very closely to understand what that demand is and when it will be available,\" Fotheringham told Reuters.\n\nAt a cost ranging between $1 million and $3 million apiece, according to Navy and defence contractor sources, drones offer a relatively cheap and fast way to expand the Navy's fleet, especially as several large traditional shipbuilding projects - like a new class of frigate warships - are running years behind schedule.\n\nThe US is testing using robot ships in active combat scenarios. But their more immediate use is for missions that are too costly and numerous for manned naval fleets.\n\nThis includes maritime surveillance, minehunting, and protecting critical undersea infrastructure, like gas pipelines and fibre-optic cables, four drone companies told Reuters.\n\nSwarms of small sea drones could also act as a shield for valuable crewed assets like aircraft carriers and submarines, and tangle up troop-carrying ships in the event China tries to invade Taiwan, said Bryan Clark, an advisor to the Navy on autonomous craft and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute - a think tank headquartered in Washington.\n\nClark estimates the Navy has around 100 small drones for use on the ocean surface and another 100 underwater drones, while China has a similar-sized autonomous force that is growing fast.

The first tranche also includes undisclosed maritime surface products, other aerial drones and counter-drone systems (c-UAS).\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed it has $500 million in funding to support Replicator in fiscal year 2024, including about $300 million from the recently passed defense appropriations bill, in addition to funds siphoned from other defense accounts. For 2025, the Pentagon has requested about $500 million to continue the second year of Replicator.\n\nThis move underscores the Pentagon's commitment to strengthening the U.S. military's technological edge, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region, according to Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.\n\nAeroVironment, based in Simi Valley, California, is expected to scale up production to meet the Department's requirements. The initiative also represents a broader strategy to diversify the defense industrial base by incorporating both traditional and non-traditional companies.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Stone in Washington.

That's a tiny fraction of the $63 billion Navy procurement budget proposed by President Joe Biden's administration for 2025.\n\nMilitary sea drones can range from missile-armed speed boats to minehunting miniature submarines and solar-powered sailboats equipped with high-definition spy cameras, underwater sensors and loudspeakers used to holler warnings at enemy ships.\n\nBut when the Navy has deployed sea drones on reconnaissance missions in recent years, it hasn't always had the fleet expertise to use them, the two Navy sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThere aren't enough Navy sailors trained to pilot drones or to analyze vast swathes of data sent back from the craft's cameras and sensors, the sources said.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Navy was in the process of improving its data collection and analysis from sensors.\n\nPentagon spokesman Pahon said the DoD has been \"laser-focused on accelerating innovation over the last three years\", including the use of sea drones.\n\nAcknowledging budget challenges, Pahon said the Pentagon was using innovative ways to cross \"the valley of death\", a term used to describe the torturous approval process new inventions travel through to be purchased in large quantities.\n\nREPLICATOR\n\nOne example Pahon cited was the Replicator program: the short-term, $500 million-a-year project is designed to cut through bureaucracy and fast track the deployment of thousands of cheap aerial and sea drones.\n\nThese drones will be used to match China's rapidly-growing air and naval power in the Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon's Hicks said at the project's launch in August. She said Replicator is being funded mainly by reallocating funds from the existing Pentagon budget.\n\nAs part of the initiative, the Pentagon in January issued a solicitation for private companies to deliver small sea drones to the Navy, demanding production capacity of 120 vessels per year, with deployment beginning in April 2025.\n\nDuane Fotheringham, president of unmanned systems at Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, acknowledged the Pentagon and Navy had shown their \"intent\" to accelerate the deployment of sea drones but he said the industry wanted to see long-term funding in the defense budget.\n\n\"We hear the demand signal ... but we all have to work together very closely to understand what that demand is and when it will be available,\" Fotheringham told Reuters.\n\nAt a cost ranging between $1 million and $3 million apiece, according to Navy and defense contractor sources, drones offer a relatively cheap and fast way to expand the Navy's fleet, especially as several large traditional shipbuilding projects - like a new class of frigate warships - are running years behind schedule.\n\nThe U.S. is testing using robot ships in active combat scenarios. But their more immediate use is for missions that are too costly and numerous for manned naval fleets.\n\nThis includes maritime surveillance, minehunting, and protecting critical undersea infrastructure, like gas pipelines and fiber-optic cables, four drone companies told Reuters.\n\nSwarms of small sea drones could also act as a shield for valuable crewed assets like aircraft carriers and submarines, and tangle up troop-carrying ships in the event China tries to invade Taiwan, said Bryan Clark, an advisor to the Navy on autonomous craft and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute - a think tank headquartered in Washington.\n\nClark estimates the Navy has around 100 small drones for use on the ocean surface and another 100 underwater drones, while China has a similar-sized autonomous force that is growing fast. The Navy spokesperson declined to comment on how many drones it has in operation.\n\n\"Ukraine has shown how effective they can be and how they can be employed in current operations,\" Clark said. \"The U.S. Navy needs to embrace that lesson and field combat (sea drones) right away.\"\n\nThe Navy's 5th fleet, which operates out of Bahrain, has been testing unmanned vessels for three years, led by its Task Force 59 unit.\n\nThe project has deployed surveillance drones built by private firms, including startups, as well as those backed by defense heavyweights like Lockheed Martin and HII.\n\n\"The situation in the Red Sea gives the work of Task Force 59 added urgency and we look forward to fielding solutions to help counter Houthi malign behaviour,\" Colin Corridan, commander of the task force, told Reuters.\n\nMISSILE TEST\n\nIn October, the Navy carried out its first live missile test from an unmanned speedboat in the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe T38 Devil Ray, built by Florida-based sea drone firm MARTAC, successfully launched a miniature missile system to destroy a target boat, with a human operator ashore giving the order, according to a Navy announcement and video.\n\nMARTAC's Chief Marketing Officer, Stephen Ferretti, referred questions about the operation to the Navy.\n\nThe use of unmanned vessels was expanded to the Navy's 4th Fleet in central America last year where they have been used to crack down on human smuggling off the northern coast of Haiti.\n\nOne of the companies operating there is Saildrone, a California-based firm that makes wind-, solar- and diesel-powered autonomous vessels that collect images and data with cameras and sensors.\n\nSaildrone has circumnavigated Washington's funding politics. Because the company operates and maintains its own vessels, and charges a service fee for the data they collect, the Navy can pay to use the drones out of its operating expenses rather than procurement budget.\n\nSaildrone launched the Surveyor, its largest vessel, which has been tailored for the military, at an event in March attended by Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti.\n\nThe drone firm, which also supplies coast guards and ocean survey departments, has a fleet of 130 vessels and is building several more every month, said Richard Jenkins, the company's founder.\n\n\"Right now, we are struggling to keep up with demand,\" Jenkins told Reuters in an interview. He declined to comment on how much Saildrone charges the Navy.\n\nOcean Aero builds the autonomous Triton vessel, which can move on the surface or underwater to collect data and hunt for mines using sensors. The company, which is backed by Lockheed Martin, opened a 63,000 feet manufacturing facility in Gulfport, Mississippi last October that is capable of churning out 150 Tritons a year.\n\nLockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHII was awarded a contract last October to build nine small underwater drones for the U.S. Navy's Lionfish program, with the potential for this to rise to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The contract could total $347 million, although that is far from guaranteed.\n\nThe Lionfish program - which is focused on the Indo-Pacific where the U.S. is vying for control with China - is based on HII's Remus 300, a minehunting drone that can be launched like a torpedo from a crewed ship or submarine.\n\nThese programs are proof that the Pentagon is trying to move faster to deploy sea drones, spokesman Pahon told Reuters.\n\n\"We know we need to keep pushing to stay ahead,\" he said.

There aren't enough Navy sailors trained to pilot drones or to analyze vast swathes of data sent back from the craft's cameras and sensors, the sources said.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Navy was in the process of improving its data collection and analysis from sensors. Pentagon spokesman Pahon said the DoD has been \"laser-focused on accelerating innovation over the last three years\", including the use of sea drones. Acknowledging budget challenges, Pahon said the Pentagon was using innovative ways to cross \"the valley of death\", a term used to describe the torturous approval process new inventions travel through to be purchased in large quantities. REPLICATOR One example Pahon cited was the Replicator program: the short-term, $500 million-a-year project is designed to cut through bureaucracy and fast track the deployment of thousands of cheap aerial and sea drones. These drones will be used to match China's rapidly-growing air and naval power in the Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon's Hicks said at the project's launch in August.

At a cost ranging between $1 million and $3 million apiece, according to Navy and defense contractor sources, drones offer a relatively cheap and fast way to expand the Navy's fleet, especially as several large traditional shipbuilding projects - like a new class of frigate warships - are running years behind schedule. The U.S. is testing using robot ships in active combat scenarios. But their more immediate use is for missions that are too costly and numerous for manned naval fleets. This includes maritime surveillance, minehunting, and protecting critical undersea infrastructure, like gas pipelines and fiber-optic cables, four drone companies told Reuters. Swarms of small sea drones could also act as a shield for valuable crewed assets like aircraft carriers and submarines, and tangle up troop-carrying ships in the event China tries to invade Taiwan, said Bryan Clark, an advisor to the Navy on autonomous craft and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute - a think tank headquartered in Washington.Clark estimates the Navy has around 100 small drones for use on the ocean surface and another 100 underwater drones, while China has a similar-sized autonomous force that is growing fast. The Navy spokesperson declined to comment on how many drones it has in operation. \"Ukraine has shown how effective they can be and how they can be employed in current operations,\" Clark said. \"The U.S. Navy needs to embrace that lesson and field combat (sea drones) right away.\" The Navy's 5th fleet, which operates out of Bahrain, has been testing unmanned vessels for three years, led by its Task Force 59 unit.\n\nThe project has deployed surveillance drones built by private firms, including startups, as well as those backed by defense heavyweights like Lockheed Martin and HII. \"The situation in the Red Sea gives the work of Task Force 59 added urgency and we look forward to fielding solutions to help counter Houthi malign behaviour,\" Colin Corridan, commander of the task force, told Reuters. MISSILE TEST In October, the Navy carried out its first live missile test from an unmanned speedboat in the Arabian Peninsula. The T38 Devil Ray, built by Florida-based sea drone firm MARTAC, successfully launched a miniature missile system to destroy a target boat, with a human operator ashore giving the order, according to a Navy announcement and video. MARTAC's Chief Marketing Officer, Stephen Ferretti, referred questions about the operation to the Navy. The use of unmanned vessels was expanded to the Navy's 4th Fleet in central America last year where they have been used to crack down on human smuggling off the northern coast of Haiti. One of the companies operating there is Saildrone, a California-based firm that makes wind-, solar- and diesel-powered autonomous vessels that collect images and data with cameras and sensors. Saildrone has circumnavigated Washington's funding politics. Because the company operates and maintains its own vessels, and charges a service fee for the data they collect, the Navy can pay to use the drones out of its operating expenses rather than procurement budget. Saildrone launched the Surveyor, its largest vessel, which has been tailored for the military, at an event in March attended by Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti. The drone firm, which also supplies coast guards and ocean survey departments, has a fleet of 130 vessels and is building several more every month, said Richard Jenkins, the company's founder. \"Right now, we are struggling to keep up with demand,\" Jenkins told Reuters in an interview. He declined to comment on how much Saildrone charges the Navy. Ocean Aero builds the autonomous Triton vessel, which can move on the surface or underwater to collect data and hunt for mines using sensors. The company, which is backed by Lockheed Martin, opened a 63,000 feet manufacturing facility in Gulfport, Mississippi last October that is capable of churning out 150 Tritons a year. Lockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment. HII was awarded a contract last October to build nine small underwater drones for the U.S. Navy's Lionfish program, with the potential for this to rise to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The contract could total $347 million, although that is far from guaranteed. The Lionfish program - which is focused on the Indo-Pacific where the U.S. is vying for control with China - is based on HII's Remus 300, a minehunting drone that can be launched like a torpedo from a crewed ship or submarine. These programs are proof that the Pentagon is trying to move faster to deploy sea drones, spokesman Pahon told Reuters. \"We know we need to keep pushing to stay ahead,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Joe

The Pentagon announced the Switchblade's selection in the program on Monday.\n\nOther companies are expected to win support for their systems as well, but it's not clear how many of them will be publicly disclosed.\n\nContractors whose weapons are selected will see millions of dollars in increased sales as the department plans to scale production to meet its ambitious goals.

In PB25, the Department has requested a roughly equal amount to the FY24 total and will work with Congress to support this request.\n\nThese investments bring together the capabilities of a broad range of traditional and nontraditional technology companies, including systems vendors, component manufacturers, and software developers.\n\n\"I am pleased to announce that the Department will begin investing in scalable production for these critical capabilities,\" said Hicks. \"We are taking an important step toward strengthening our defense and technology industrial base. And, we are demonstrating the Department's ability to break down barriers to scaling innovation at speed not just for ADA2 systems, but in our ability to develop new capabilities and processes for the Department and key stakeholders, including Congress.\"\n\nThe first tranche of Replicator capabilities include uncrewed surface vehicles (USV), uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) and counter-uncrewed aerial systems (c-UAS) of various sizes and payloads from several traditional and non-traditional vendors.\n\nIn the air domain, the Department will accelerate fielding of the Switchblade-600 loitering munition, produced by Simi Valley, CA-based AeroVironment Inc. U.S.-supplied Switchblade drones have already demonstrated their utility in Ukraine, and this system will provide additional capability to U.S. forces.\n\n\"This is a critical step in delivering the capabilities we need, at the scale and speed we need, to continue securing a free and open Indo-Pacific\" said Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. \"The entire Department has come together to help make this a reality.\"\n\nIn the maritime domain, the Department is diversifying the vendor base for USVs through the recently announced Production-Ready, Inexpensive, Maritime Expeditionary (PRIME) Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO). The CSO process allows U.S. and international companies to pitch technologies to the Department in a fast-track process for a prototype contract. Launched on January 30, 2024, the PRIME CSO received over one hundred applications from commercial technology companies. With FY24 funding secured, the Department is on track to award several contracts this summer.\n\nThe first tranche of Replicator also includes certain capabilities that remain classified, including others in the maritime domain and some in the counter-UAS portfolio.\n\n\"Meeting the strategic imperatives facing the nation requires that we harness the very best of America's commercial technology in non-traditional partners, alongside our traditional sources of defense capabilities,\" said Doug Beck, Director of the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). \"Replicator is doing just that, and that is why we at DIU are proud to work with our partners from across the Department of Defense to make it a reality.\"\n\nSince Deputy Secretary Hicks' announcement of the Replicator initiative and its initial focus on ADA2 systems just over seven months ago, the Department-wide effort has systematically aligned senior leaders around a common vision to identify and validate key joint operational gaps and rapidly field solutions in 18-24 months. The Department is also preparing the next tranche of capabilities to add to the ADA2 portfolio.\n\n\"This is just the beginning,\" said Admiral Christopher Grady, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \"Replicator is helping us jumpstart the delivery of critical capabilities at scale.

The U.S. is floundering. | Technology", "body": "In a signal of the Pentagon's intent, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced an initiative in August - named Replicator - to deploy hundreds of small, relatively cheap air and sea drones within the next 18-24 months to match China's growing military threat. This public show of commitment masks years of hesitation by the U.S. Navy to build a fleet of unmanned vessels despite repeated warnings this was the future of maritime warfare, according to interviews with a dozen people with direct knowledge of the U.S. sea drone plans, including Navy officers, Pentagon officials, and sea drone company executives.\n\nThe U.S. Navy's efforts to build a fleet of unmanned vessels are faltering because the Pentagon remains wedded to big shipbuilding projects, according to some officials and company executives, exposing a weakness as sea drones reshape naval warfare.\n\nThe lethal effectiveness of sea drones has been demonstrated in the Black Sea where Ukraine has deployed remote-controlled speed boats packed with explosives to sink Russian frigates and minesweepers since late 2022. Yemeni-backed Houthi rebels have employed similar vessels against commercial shipping in the Red Sea in recent months, albeit without success.\n\nThese tactics have caught the attention of the Pentagon, which is incorporating lessons from Ukraine and the Red Sea into its plans to counter China's rising naval power in the Pacific, Pentagon Spokesman Eric Pahon told Reuters. In a signal of the Pentagon's intent, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks announced an initiative in August - named Replicator - to deploy hundreds of small, relatively cheap air and sea drones within the next 18-24 months to match China's growing military threat.\n\nThis public show of commitment masks years of hesitation by the U.S. Navy to build a fleet of unmanned vessels despite repeated warnings this was the future of maritime warfare, according to interviews with a dozen people with direct knowledge of the U.S. sea drone plans, including Navy officers, Pentagon officials, and sea drone company executives. Two Navy sources and three executives at sea drone manufacturers said the biggest impediment to progress has been a Department of Defense (DoD) budget process that prioritizes big ships and submarines built by legacy defense contractors.\n\n\"At some point, you hit the D.C. problem,\" said Philipp Stratmann, CEO at Ocean Power Technologies (OPT), a New Jersey-based firm that supplies the U.S. Navy with the WAM-V, an autonomous surface drone. \"You hit the fact that there is a military industrial complex that has the best lobbyists and knows exactly how the money flows and contracting works in the DOD.\"\n\nA Navy spokesperson said it \"acquires capabilities based on fleet demand signals\", referring to the messages headquarters receive from commanders at sea. The Navy has a budget of $172 million this year for small and medium-sized underwater sea drones, falling to $101.8 million in 2025, the spokesperson said. That's a tiny fraction of the $63 billion Navy procurement budget proposed by President Joe Biden's administration for 2025.\n\nMilitary sea drones can range from missile-armed speed boats to minehunting miniature submarines and solar-powered sailboats equipped with high-definition spy cameras, underwater sensors and loudspeakers used to holler warnings at enemy ships. But when the Navy has deployed sea drones on reconnaissance missions in recent years, it hasn't always had the fleet expertise to use them, the two Navy sources said, asking not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n\nThere aren't enough Navy sailors trained to pilot drones or to analyze vast swathes of data sent back from the craft's cameras and sensors, the sources said. The spokesperson said the Navy was in the process of improving its data collection and analysis from sensors.\n\nPentagon spokesman Pahon said the DoD has been \"laser-focused on accelerating innovation over the last three years\", including the use of sea drones. Acknowledging budget challenges, Pahon said the Pentagon was using innovative ways to cross \"the valley of death\", a term used to describe the torturous approval process new inventions travel through to be purchased in large quantities.\n\nREPLICATOR One example Pahon cited was the Replicator program: the short-term, $500 million-a-year project is designed to cut through bureaucracy and fast track the deployment of thousands of cheap aerial and sea drones.\n\nThese drones will be used to match China's rapidly-growing air and naval power in the Asia-Pacific region, the Pentagon's Hicks said at the project's launch in August. She said Replicator is being funded mainly by reallocating funds from the existing Pentagon budget. As part of the initiative, the Pentagon in January issued a solicitation for private companies to deliver small sea drones to the Navy, demanding production capacity of 120 vessels per year, with deployment beginning in April 2025.\n\nDuane Fotheringham, president of unmanned systems at Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII), the largest U.S. military shipbuilder, acknowledged the Pentagon and Navy had shown their \"intent\" to accelerate the deployment of sea drones but he said the industry wanted to see long-term funding in the defense budget. \"We hear the demand signal ... but we all have to work together very closely to understand what that demand is and when it will be available,\" Fotheringham told Reuters.\n\nAt a cost ranging between $1 million and $3 million apiece, according to Navy and defense contractor sources, drones offer a relatively cheap and fast way to expand the Navy's fleet, especially as several large traditional shipbuilding projects - like a new class of frigate warships - are running years behind schedule. The U.S. is testing using robot ships in active combat scenarios. But their more immediate use is for missions that are too costly and numerous for manned naval fleets.\n\nThis includes maritime surveillance, minehunting, and protecting critical undersea infrastructure, like gas pipelines and fiber-optic cables, four drone companies told Reuters. Swarms of small sea drones could also act as a shield for valuable crewed assets like aircraft carriers and submarines, and tangle up troop-carrying ships in the event China tries to invade Taiwan, said Bryan Clark, an advisor to the Navy on autonomous craft and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute - a think tank headquartered in Washington.\n\nClark estimates the Navy has around 100 small drones for use on the ocean surface and another 100 underwater drones, while China has a similar-sized autonomous force that is growing fast. The Navy spokesperson declined to comment on how many drones it has in operation. \"Ukraine has shown how effective they can be and how they can be employed in current operations,\" Clark said. \"The U.S. Navy needs to embrace that lesson and field combat (sea drones) right away.\"\n\nThe Navy's 5th fleet, which operates out of Bahrain, has been testing unmanned vessels for three years, led by its Task Force 59 unit. The project has deployed surveillance drones built by private firms, including startups, as well as those backed by defense heavyweights like Lockheed Martin and HII.\n\n\"The situation in the Red Sea gives the work of Task Force 59 added urgency and we look forward to fielding solutions to help counter Houthi malign behaviour,\" Colin Corridan, commander of the task force, told Reuters. MISSILE TEST\n\nIn October, the Navy carried out its first live missile test from an unmanned speedboat in the Arabian Peninsula. The T38 Devil Ray, built by Florida-based sea drone firm MARTAC, successfully launched a miniature missile system to destroy a target boat, with a human operator ashore giving the order, according to a Navy announcement and video.\n\nMARTAC's Chief Marketing Officer, Stephen Ferretti, referred questions about the operation to the Navy. The use of unmanned vessels was expanded to the Navy's 4th Fleet in central America last year where they have been used to crack down on human smuggling off the northern coast of Haiti.\n\nOne of the companies operating there is Saildrone, a California-based firm that makes wind-, solar- and diesel-powered autonomous vessels that collect images and data with cameras and sensors. Saildrone has circumnavigated Washington's funding politics. Because the company operates and maintains its own vessels, and charges a service fee for the data they collect, the Navy can pay to use the drones out of its operating expenses rather than procurement budget.\n\nSaildrone launched the Surveyor, its largest vessel, which has been tailored for the military, at an event in March attended by Chief of Naval Operations Lisa Franchetti. The drone firm, which also supplies coast guards and ocean survey departments, has a fleet of 130 vessels and is building several more every month, said Richard Jenkins, the company's founder.\n\n\"Right now, we are struggling to keep up with demand,\" Jenkins told Reuters in an interview. He declined to comment on how much Saildrone charges the Navy. Ocean Aero builds the autonomous Triton vessel, which can move on the surface or underwater to collect data and hunt for mines using sensors. The company, which is backed by Lockheed Martin, opened a 63,000 feet manufacturing facility in Gulfport, Mississippi last October that is capable of churning out 150 Tritons a year.\n\nLockheed Martin did not respond to a request for comment. HII was awarded a contract last October to build nine small underwater drones for the U.S. Navy's Lionfish program, with the potential for this to rise to 200 vehicles over the next five years. The contract could total $347 million, although that is far from guaranteed.\n\nThe Lionfish program - which is focused on the Indo-Pacific where the U.S. is vying for control with China - is based on HII's Remus 300, a minehunting drone that can be launched like a torpedo from a crewed ship or submarine. These programs are proof that the Pentagon is trying to move faster to deploy sea drones, spokesman Pahon told Reuters.\n\n\"We know we need to keep pushing to stay ahead,\" he said.\n\n(This story

In PB25, the Department has requested a roughly equal amount to the FY24 total and will work with Congress to support this request.\n\nThese investments bring together the capabilities of a broad range of traditional and nontraditional technology companies, including systems vendors, component manufacturers, and software developers.\n\n\"I am pleased to announce that the Department will begin investing in scalable production for these critical capabilities,\" said Hicks. \"We are taking an important step toward strengthening our defense and technology industrial base. And, we are demonstrating the Department's ability to break down barriers to scaling innovation at speed not just for ADA2 systems, but in our ability to develop new capabilities and processes for the Department and key stakeholders, including Congress.\"\n\nThe first tranche of Replicator capabilities include uncrewed surface vehicles (USV), uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) and counter-uncrewed aerial systems (c-UAS) of various sizes and payloads from several traditional and non-traditional vendors.\n\nIn the air domain, the Department will accelerate fielding of the Switchblade-600 loitering munition, produced by Simi Valley, CA-based AeroVironment Inc. U.S.-supplied Switchblade drones have already demonstrated their utility in Ukraine, and this system will provide additional capability to U.S. forces.\n\n\"This is a critical step in delivering the capabilities we need, at the scale and speed we need, to continue securing a free and open Indo-Pacific\" said Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. \"The entire Department has come together to help make this a reality.\"\n\nIn the maritime domain, the Department is diversifying the vendor base for USVs through the recently announced Production-Ready, Inexpensive, Maritime Expeditionary (PRIME) Commercial Solutions Opening (CSO). The CSO process allows U.S. and international companies to pitch technologies to the Department in a fast-track process for a prototype contract. Launched on January 30, 2024, the PRIME CSO received over one hundred applications from commercial technology companies.

(Aaron Mehta/Breaking Defense)\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Pentagon released new details about its Replicator initiative today, confirming AeroVironment's Switchblade 600 one-way attack drone is, in fact, part of the first tranche.\n\n\"The first tranche of Replicator capabilities include uncrewed surface vehicles (USV), uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) and counter-uncrewed aerial systems (c-UAS) of various sizes and payloads from several traditional and non-traditional vendors,\" the department wrote in a press release.\n\nUp in the air, the Army's Switchblade-600 loitering munition bid was greenlit for this first batch after it \"already demonstrated ... [its] utility in Ukraine, and this system will provide additional capability to US forces,\" the Pentagon added.\n\nEarlier this year, Defense Scoop reported that Switchblade made the final cut. Army acquisition head Doug Bush subsequently confirmed that his service submitted a trio of capabilities for the first Replicator round and noted that one was selected and would likely be the \"biggest participant ... in terms of quantity.\" (He said the service has proposed three more technologies for the second tranche.)\n\nBeyond the Switchblade-600 news today, the Pentagon is remaining mum about the other systems picked this round citing classification levels but said there are other capabilities in the maritime domain and counter-UAS realm. However, when it comes to maritime tech, the department noted that it wants to diversify its USV vendor base via the Production-Ready, Inexpensive, Maritime Expeditionary (PRIME) commercial solutions opening.\n\nIn August 2023, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks unveiled the new Replicator inactive and billed it as one avenue for countering China's military mass by cranking out multiple thousands of \"attritable autonomous systems\" within two years -- think unmanned surface vessels and loitering drones. However, specifics have largely remained under wraps, even as the department secured approximately $500 million in fiscal 2024 funding, and requested an equal amount in funding for FY25.\n\n\"This is a critical step in delivering the capabilities we need, at the scale and speed we need, to continue securing a free and open Indo-Pacific\" said Admiral Samuel Paparo, commander of US Indo-Pacific Command. \"The entire department has come together to help make this a reality.\"", "source": {"uri": "breakingdefense.sites.breakingmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking Defense"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_roque@breakingdefense.sites.breakingmedia.com", "name": "Ashley Roque", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroVironment_Switchblade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AeroVironment Switchblade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicator_(Star_Trek)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Replicator (Star Trek)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loitering_munition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Loitering munition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_surface_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned surface vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Hicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kathleen Hicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Indo-Pacific_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Indo-Pacific Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indo-Pacific"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomous robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Deputy_Secretary_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Deputy Secretary of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://sites.breakingmedia.com/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/230405_SAS_underwater_drone_Mehta_crop-1024x576.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542409", "eventUri": "eng-9542409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The Department is also preparing the next tranche of capabilities to add to the ADA2 portfolio.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replicator_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Replicator (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncrewed_spacecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uncrewed spacecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriations_bill_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appropriations bill (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Paparo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Paparo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loitering_munition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loitering munition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_surface_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned surface vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pacific", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indo-Pacific"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switchblade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroVironment", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AeroVironment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_strategy_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief strategy officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simi_Valley,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Simi Valley, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Simi Valley, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_Innovation_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defense Innovation Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Indo-Pacific_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Indo-Pacific Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_principal_axes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft principal axes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542409", "eventUri": "eng-9542409", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 239774852, "title": "Shane Ross: Green Party leader Eamon Ryan runs out of road but collects a sweet pension toll", "text": "Shed no tears. Eamon Ryan is leaving politics. Weeping and gnashing of teeth hardly flooded the airwaves. Ritual tributes poured in from the Taoiseach and the T\u00e1naiste. Eamon called the media into his presence last Tuesday morning and offered some hackneyed reasons: he wanted to spend more time with his family; social media had become unbearable for sensitive souls; he wanted to \u201cpass the torch to a new generation of leaders\u201d. Eamon never mentioned pensions, or anything so vulgar. That hadn\u2019t even crossed his mind. Why would it? The leader of the Green Party is a stripling of only 60. Nevertheless, he will leave Leinster House with his saddle bags full. He has served 17 years as a TD, eight of those as a minister. If he survives in Cabinet until November, his combined pensions will amount to around \u20ac94,000 a year.", "summary": "<p>Shed no tears. Eamon Ryan is leaving politics.

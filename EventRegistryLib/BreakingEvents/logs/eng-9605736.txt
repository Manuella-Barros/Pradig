(AP) -- Stewart-Haas Racing, a two-time NASCAR championship team with 69 Cup Series victories since its 2009 formation, will close its organization at the end of this season\n\nCo-owners Tony Stewart and Gene Haas announced the decision after nearly a year of rumors that their four-car Cup team was looking to sell its charters and either scale back or exit the stock car series completely. The news was delivered to the nearly 300 SHR employees late Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is a decision that did not come easily, nor was it made quickly,\" the owners said. \"Racing is a labor-intensive, humbling sport. It requires unwavering commitment and vast resources, with a 365-day mindset to be better than everyone else. It's part of what makes success so rewarding. But the commitment needed to extract maximum performance while providing sustainability is incredibly demanding, and we've reached a point in our respective personal and business lives where it's time to pass the torch.\"\n\nSHR this year fields Cup cars for Josh Berry, Chase Briscoe, Noah Gragson and Ryan Preece. Berry and Gragson are in their first seasons with the team. SHR holds the 2025 option on Briscoe and he has not been permitted to discuss future employment options even as rumors have swirled that SHR would close.\n\n\"Stewart Haas has been home to my family and I for the last 7 years and at the end of the year myself and the entire organization will be looking for a new home and new opportunities in the Cup series,\" Briscoe posted on social media. \"I have amazing partners behind me and can't wait to get them back in victory lane.\"\n\nThe move will also shutter the SHR Xfinity Series team, whose two cars are driven by Cole Custer and Riley Herbst.\n\nGene Haas founded Haas CNC Racing in 2002 and the California businessman lured Stewart in as a co-owner ahead of the 2009 season. Stewart had won two Cup championships for Joe Gibbs Racing at the time but couldn't turn down an equity stake and opportunity to help a small team contend for titles.\n\nStewart in his 2009 debut season gave the rebranded team its first Cup victory -- he won four races that year -- and its first Cup title in 2011. Kevin Harvick added a second championship in 2014.\n\nStewart, Harvick and Clint Bowyer have all retired from NASCAR driving and SHR since then has been in a grueling rebuild. The organization's last Cup Series win was in 2022 with Harvick a year before he retired. SHR didn't win a Cup race last season.\n\nThe team also is set to lose some of its support from Ford at the end of the season, although Mark Rushbrook, the global director of Ford Performance, told The Associated Press last week he had no idea what SHR's plans are beyond this year.\n\nSHR also lost major sponsorship this season when Smithfield Foods exited NASCAR and Anheuser-Busch moved to Trackhouse Racing.\n\nHaas spends most of his time with his Formula 1 team and Stewart is driving a full NHRA schedule, making both absentee owners at NASCAR events. The 71-year-old Haas was also ill for much of last year.\n\nThe NASCAR team is primarily run by Joe Custer, the chief operating officer and longtime Gene Haas confidant. His son, Cole, won the Xfinity championship last year for SHR.\n\nAmong SHR's accomplishments are the two Cup titles, two Xfinity championships and victories that include crown-jewel events such as the Daytona 500, Brickyard 400 and Southern 500.\n\n\"We're proud of all the wins and championships we've earned since joining together in 2009, but even more special is the culture we built and the friendships we forged as we committed to a common cause - winning races and collecting trophies,\" Stewart and Haas said. \"We have tremendous respect and appreciation for all of our employees, and we will work diligently to assist them during this transition to find new opportunities beyond the 2024 race season.\"\n\nPart of Haas' F1 team is run from the Kannapolis-based shop and it is unclear if that will continue or if Haas has plans to also depart from F1.\n\nIt's also not clear what happens to the four charters SHR holds that guarantee entry into the field every week. Spire Motorsports last year bought a charter for $40 million, but the actual charter value fluctuates annually.\n\nTeams are in a bitter fight with NASCAR over charters, which are set to expire at the end of this season. The teams want them made permanent and not renewable but NASCAR has refused to budge on the issue.\n\nShould SHR be able to sell the charters, it appears there is interest from Front Row Motorsports, 23XI Racing and Trackhouse. There is also speculation that Joe Custer may retain one of the charters and run a car for his son.\n\nWhere SHR's drivers land is unknown. Briscoe should be able to start talking to other teams now about his future.

(AP) -- Stewart-Haas Racing, a two-time NASCAR championship team with 69 Cup Series victories since its 2009 formation, will close its organization at the end of this season\n\nCo-owners Tony Stewart and Gene Haas announced the decision after nearly a year of rumors that their four-car Cup team was looking to sell its charters and either scale back or exit the stock car series completely. The news was delivered to the nearly 300 SHR employees late Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is a decision that did not come easily, nor was it made quickly,\" the owners said. \"Racing is a labor-intensive, humbling sport. It requires unwavering commitment and vast resources, with a 365-day mindset to be better than everyone else. It's part of what makes success so rewarding. But the commitment needed to extract maximum performance while providing sustainability is incredibly demanding, and we've reached a point in our respective personal and business lives where it's time to pass the torch.\"\n\nSHR this year fields Cup cars for Josh Berry, Chase Briscoe, Noah Gragson and Ryan Preece. Berry and Gragson are in their first seasons with the team. SHR holds the 2025 option on Briscoe and he has not been permitted to discuss future employment options even as rumors have swirled that SHR would close.\n\n\"Stewart Haas has been home to my family and I for the last 7 years and at the end of the year myself and the entire organization will be looking for a new home and new opportunities in the Cup series,\" Briscoe posted on social media. \"I have amazing partners behind me and can't wait to get them back in victory lane.\"\n\nThe move will also shutter the SHR Xfinity Series team, whose two cars are driven by Cole Custer and Riley Herbst.\n\nGene Haas founded Haas CNC Racing in 2002 and the California businessman lured Stewart in as a co-owner ahead of the 2009 season. Stewart had won two Cup championships for Joe Gibbs Racing at the time but couldn't turn down an equity stake and opportunity to help a small team contend for titles.\n\nStewart in his 2009 debut season gave the rebranded team its first Cup victory -- he won four races that year -- and its first Cup title in 2011. Kevin Harvick added a second championship in 2014.\n\nStewart, Harvick and Clint Bowyer have all retired from NASCAR driving and SHR since then has been in a grueling rebuild. The organization's last Cup Series win was in 2022 with Harvick a year before he retired. SHR didn't win a Cup race last season.\n\nThe team also is set to lose some of its support from Ford at the end of the season, although Mark Rushbrook, the global director of Ford Performance, told The Associated Press last week he had no idea what SHR's plans are beyond this year.\n\nSHR also lost major sponsorship this season when Smithfield Foods exited NASCAR and Anheuser-Busch moved to Trackhouse Racing.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHaas spends most of his time with his Formula 1 team and Stewart is driving a full NHRA schedule, making both absentee owners at NASCAR events. The 71-year-old Haas was also ill for much of last year.\n\nThe NASCAR team is primarily run by Joe Custer, the chief operating officer and longtime Gene Haas confidant. His son, Cole, won the Xfinity championship last year for SHR.\n\nAmong SHR's accomplishments are the two Cup titles, two Xfinity championships and victories that include crown-jewel events such as the Daytona 500, Brickyard 400 and Southern 500.\n\n\"We're proud of all the wins and championships we've earned since joining together in 2009, but even more special is the culture we built and the friendships we forged as we committed to a common cause - winning races and collecting trophies,\" Stewart and Haas said. \"We have tremendous respect and appreciation for all of our employees, and we will work diligently to assist them during this transition to find new opportunities beyond the 2024 race season.\"\n\nPart of Haas' F1 team is run from the Kannapolis-based shop and it is unclear if that will continue or if Haas has plans to also depart from F1.\n\nIt's also not clear what happens to the four charters SHR holds that guarantee entry into the field every week. Spire Motorsports last year bought a charter for $40 million, but the actual charter value fluctuates annually.\n\nTeams are in a bitter fight with NASCAR over charters, which are set to expire at the end of this season. The teams want them made permanent and not renewable but NASCAR has refused to budge on the issue.\n\nShould SHR be able to sell the charters, it appears there is interest from Front Row Motorsports, 23XI Racing and Trackhouse. There is also speculation that Joe Custer may retain one of the charters and run a car for his son.\n\nWhere SHR's drivers land is unknown. Briscoe should be able to start talking to other teams now about his future. The team also held an option for next year on Berry, who doesn't bring much personal sponsorship and got the break of his career when SHR hired him ahead of this season.\n\nGragson's contract was announced as a multi-year deal and has backing from Bass Pro Shops to take to another team. Preece is in a contract year with SHR so was already free to shop around the series.\n\nCole Custer could end up in a car in either Cup or the Xfinity Series with backing of Haas' CNC Automation company, wile Herbst has significant financial backing from Monster Energy that should give him options.\n\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The news was delivered to the nearly 300 SHR employees late Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is a decision that did not come easily, nor was it made quickly,\" the owners said. \"Racing is a labor-intensive, humbling sport. It requires unwavering commitment and vast resources, with a 365-day mindset to be better than everyone else. It's part of what makes success so rewarding. But the commitment needed to extract maximum performance while providing sustainability is incredibly demanding, and we've reached a point in our respective personal and business lives where it's time to pass the torch.\"\n\nSHR this year fields Cup Series cars for Josh Berry, Chase Briscoe, Noah Gragson and Ryan Preece. Berry and Gragson are in their first seasons with the team. SHR holds the 2025 option on Briscoe and he has not been contractually permitted to discuss future employment options even as rumors have swirled that SHR would close.\n\n\"Stewart Haas has been home to my family and I for the last 7 years and at the end of the year myself and the entire organization will be looking for a new home and new opportunities in the Cup series,\" Briscoe posted on social media. \"I have amazing partners behind me and can't wait to get them back in victory lane.\"\n\nThe move will also shutter the SHR Xfinity Series team, with two cars driven by Cole Custer and Riley Herbst.\n\nGene Haas founded Haas CNC Racing in 2002 and the California businessman lured Stewart in as a co-owner ahead of the 2009 season. Stewart had won two Cup championships for Joe Gibbs Racing at the time but couldn't turn down an equity stake and opportunity to help a small team win races and contend for titles.\n\nStewart in his 2009 debut season gave the rebranded team its first Cup victory -- he won four races that year -- and its first Cup title in 2011. Kevin Harvick added a second championship in 2014.\n\nStewart, Harvick and Clint Bowyer have all retired from NASCAR driving and SHR since then has been in a grueling rebuild. The organization's last Cup Series win was in 2022 with Harvick a year before he retired. SHR didn't win a Cup race last season.\n\nThe team also is set to lose some of its support from Ford at the end of the season, although Mark Rushbrook, the global director of Ford Performance, told The Associated Press last week he had no idea what SHR's plans are beyond this year.\n\nSHR also lost major sponsorship this season when Smithfield Foods exited NASCAR and Anheuser-Busch moved to Trackhouse Racing.\n\nHaas spends most of his time with his Formula 1 team and Stewart is driving a full NHRA schedule, making both absentee owners at NASCAR events. The 71-year-old Haas was also ill for much of last year.\n\nThe NASCAR team is primarily run by Joe Custer, the chief operating officer and longtime Gene Haas confidant. His son, Cole, won the Xfinity championship last year for SHR.\n\nAmong SHR's accomplishments are the two Cup titles, two Xfinity championships and victories that include crown-jewel events such as the Daytona 500, Brickyard 400 and Southern 500.\n\n\"We're proud of all the wins and championships we've earned since joining together in 2009, but even more special is the culture we built and the friendships we forged as we committed to a common cause - winning races and collecting trophies,\" Stewart and Haas said. \"We have tremendous respect and appreciation for all of our employees, and we will work diligently to assist them during this transition to find new opportunities beyond the 2024 race season.\"\n\nPart of Haas' F1 team is run from the Kannapolis-based shop and it is unclear if that will continue or if Haas has plans to also depart from F1.\n\nIt's also not clear what happens to the four charters SHR holds that guarantee entry into the field every week. Spire Motorsports last year bought a charter for $40 million, but the actual charter value fluctuates annually.\n\nTeams are in a bitter fight with NASCAR over charters, which are set to expire at the end of this season. The teams want them made permanent and not renewable but NASCAR has refused to budge on the issue.\n\nShould SHR be able to sell the charters, it appears there is interest from Front Row Motorsports, 23XI Racing and Trackhouse. There is also speculation that Joe Custer may retain one of the charters and run a car for his son.\n\nWhere SHR's drivers land is unknown. Briscoe should be able to start talking to other teams now about his future. The team also held an option for next year on Berry, who doesn't bring much personal sponsorship and got the break of his career when SHR hired him ahead of this season.\n\nGragson's contract was announced as a multi-year deal and has backing from Bass Pro Shops to take to another team. Preece is in a contract year with SHR so was already free to shop around the series.\n\nCole Custer could end up in a car in either Cup or the Xfinity Series with backing of Haas' CNC Automation company, while Herbst has significant financial backing from Monster Energy that should give him options.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [],

The team, formed in 2009 when Tony Stewart became a co-owner with Gene Haas, currently fields four cars in the Cup Series for Josh Berry, Chase Briscoe, Noah Gragson and Ryan Preece. It also runs a two-car operation in the Xfinity Series for Cole Custer and Riley Herbst.\n\n\"We have made the difficult decisions to close Stewart-Haas Racing at the conclusion of the 2024 season,\" a statement from Haas and Stewart said. \"It is a decision that did not come easily, nor was it made quickly.\"\n\n\"Racing is a labor-intensive, humbling sport. It requires unwavering commitment and vast resources, with a 365-day mindset to be better than everyone else. It's part of what makes success so rewarding.\"\n\n\"But the commitment needed to extract maximum performance while providing sustainability is incredibly demanding, and we've reached a point in our respective personal and business lives where it's time to pass the torch.\"\n\n\"We're proud of all the wins and championships we've earned since joining together in 2009, but even more special is the culture we built and the friendships we forged as we committed for a common cause -- winning races and collecting trophies.\"\n\n\"That is the same commitment we made to our personnel, our partners and our fans coming into this year and that commitment will remain through the season finale at Phoenix.\"\n\n\"We have tremendous respect and appreciation for all of our employees, and we will work diligently to assist them during this transition to find new opportunities beyond the 2024 race season.\"\n\nSHR's closure comes as the team lost two longtime sponsors at the end of the 2023 season. Busch Light moved to Ross Chastain's No. 1 car at Trackhouse Racing following Kevin Harvick's retirement and Smithfield left NASCAR completely when Aric Almirola retired from full-time competition.\n\nStewart became the first driver-owner to win a NASCAR Cup Series title when he won his third championship driving for SHR in 2011. Three years later, Harvick won the Cup Series title.\n\nSince then, things have slowly trended downwards for the team even as Harvick was a stalwart. Harvick was 13th in the points standings a season ago while Almirola, Briscoe and Preece all finished outside the top 20. The organization went winless across an entire Cup Series season for the first time ever.\n\nRumors of a downsizing or total shuttering have been floated for months as SHR did not have a contract with Ford beyond the 2024 season. Teams typically have their manufacturers lined up years into the future.\n\nFour charters available\n\nThe closure of Stewart-Haas means that teams looking to expand may not have to pay top rate for a charter -- essentially NASCAR's version of a franchise. The 36 cars with charters are guaranteed entry into every single Cup Series race and also a bigger share of prize money.\n\nThe only charter on the market ahead of the 2024 season sold for approximately $40 million when Spire purchased Live Fast Racing's charter in September of 2023. With all four SHR charters now on the market, it'll be a surprise if any of the team's guaranteed entries sell for close to that number.\n\nTrackhouse could be in the market for another charter along with Front Row Motorsports. Trackhouse is loaning Zane Smith to Spire Motorsports in 2024 and an additional charter or two can make room at the two-car team for him and/or Shane van Gisbergen.\n\nThe charter agreement between NASCAR and teams currently limits teams to a maximum of four charters. However, that agreement expires at the end of the 2024 season and the sanctioning body and its teams don't seem close to terms on a new deal. In addition to SHR, Hendrick Motorsports and Joe Gibbs Racing also field four cars.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_bromberg@aol.com", "name": "Nick Bromberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart-Haas_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stewart-Haas Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tony Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riley_Herbst", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riley Herbst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Briscoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Briscoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Xfinity_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Xfinity Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Preece", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Preece"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Custer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Custer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Gragson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Gragson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackhouse_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trackhouse Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aric_Almirola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aric Almirola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Chastain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ross Chastain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harvick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Harvick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire_Motorsports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spire Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Smith_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zane Smith (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_van_Gisbergen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shane van Gisbergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gibbs_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gibbs Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Row_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front Row Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6DMRSrsV7HXP9ksflUPleQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/5769a2b0cdea283abdf8322fc96455eb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605736", "eventUri": "eng-9605736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Haas has a Formula 1 team that has struggled and the three-time Cup champion Stewart started an NHRA drag-racing team a couple of years ago that his wife drove for last year and Stewart is driving for this year.\n\nSHR has struggled in recent years and its hefty support from Ford is set to end after this season. It also lost two major sponsors in Smithfield and Anheuser-Busch prior to this year, so without that Ford support continuing it would have been difficult to sustain a four-car operation.\n\n\"We have made the difficult decision to close Stewart-Haas Racing at the conclusion of the 2024 season,\" Stewart and Haas said in a joint statement. \"It is a decision that did not come easily, nor was it made quickly.\n\n\"Racing is a labor-intensive, humbling sport. It requires unwavering commitment and vast resources, with a 365-day mindset to be better than everyone else. It's part of what makes success so rewarding. But the commitment needed to extract maximum performance while providing sustainability is incredibly demanding, and we've reached a point in our respective personal and business lives where it's time to pass the torch.\"\n\nThe organization has four charters that it can sell, and sources indicated at least three of them will go to existing Cup organizations -- one to Front Row Motorsports, one to 23XI Racing and one to Trackhouse Racing. All three of those organizations indicated they had no comment on any charter acquisitions today. Where the fourth charter goes is not clear.\n\nNot having SHR on the Cup grid will be eye-opening next season. SHR started with Haas operating Haas CNC Racing in 2002. Haas gave Stewart half the team in 2009 for him to come drive and help operate the organization. They won championships in 2011 with Stewart and 2014 with Kevin Harvick.\n\nThe organization has 69 Cup wins with the last coming in 2022 with Harvick, who retired after the 2023 season.\n\n\"We're proud of all the wins and championships we've earned since joining together in 2009, but even more special is the culture we built and the friendships we forged as we committed to a common cause -- winning races and collecting trophies,\" Stewart and Haas said in their statement.\n\n\"That is the same commitment we made to our personnel, our partners and our fans coming into this year, and that commitment will remain through the season finale at Phoenix. We have tremendous respect and appreciation for all of our employees, and we will work diligently to assist them during this transition to find new opportunities beyond the 2024 race season.\"\n\nThe closure leaves Cup drivers Chase Briscoe, Noah Gragson, Josh Berry and Ryan Preece in transition, as well as Xfinity Series drivers Cole Custer and Riley Herbst.\n\nHere's a quick look at what could happen with those drivers:\n\nBriscoe, who is 16th in the Cup standings, is the driver most often mentioned as a possibility to drive for Wood Brothers Racing next year with Harrison Burton on the hot seat as he struggles for the third consecutive year. Briscoe was in an option year with SHR and can now start to have more extensive talks with other teams.\n\nBriscoe said he has no idea where he will drive next year.\n\n\"Crazy time,\" Briscoe said in a video on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"I never thought this day would come. ... I just hope all of the guys and gals at this place finds a great opportunity because each and every single person here deserves it.\"\n\nBerry, at 19th in the standings in his rookie season and who has surged over the last month, was under contract with SHR for next year but obviously is now looking for a ride. He doesn't have much personal sponsorship but now will be talking heavily to sponsors and teams. Whether he remains in Cup is still to be determined.\n\nGragson's impressive run in his first season at SHR as he sits 21st in the standings (he'd be 19th if not for a 35-point penalty earlier this year plus what appears to be support from Bass Pro Shops, potentially could give him Cup options either at Front Row Motorsports or other teams.\n\nPreece sits 28th in the standings (he'd be 22nd if not for a 35-point penalty earlier this year) was already looking for next year as his contract was up after this season. His future seems uncertain.\n\nCuster, the former Cup driver and defending Xfinity Series champion who is third in the Xfinity standings, will be driving a car next year but still to be determined whether it is Xfinity or Cup. SHR's Xfinity programs -- it not only fields two cars but also supplies cars to other Ford teams -- could be siphoned off into a new team. Also, if Haas wants to continue involvement in NASCAR, Custer would be the natural driver for his Haas Automation company to sponsor as it has sponsored Custer for several years and Custer's father, Joe, is an SHR executive who has worked on Haas motorsports programs for decades.\n\nHerbst, seventh in the Xfintiy standings, has sponsorship from Monster Energy, and that should give him options, potentially on the Cup side.\n\nFRM (which would have two seats available) and 23XI will be seeking drivers if they obtain charters and would need sponsorship as well for them, making them possible landing spots for Herbst.\n\nTrackhouse already has a logjam of drivers with Ross Chastain, Shane van Gisbergen and Zane Smith currently under contract and Daniel Suarez expecting to sign an extension soon. There is a possibility the new charter system could limit organizations to three charters, and if that happens, Trackhouse would have to form an alliance with another team, keep van Gisbergen in Xfinity next year or release one of its drivers.\n\nLegacy Motor Club, RFK Racing and JTG Daugherty Racing have all considered expansion but are not expected to be in play for any of the SHR charters. Dale Earnhardt Jr. confirmed to FOX Sports last week that JR Motorsports also is not part of those conversations.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"},

Stewart-Haas Racing, which won the 2011 championship with Stewart and the 2014 title with Kevin Harvick, did not say what teams are in discussions to purchase the charters.\n\n\"We have made the difficult decision to close Stewart-Haas Racing at the conclusion of the 2024 season,\" a joint statement from Stewart and Haas said. \"It is a decision that did not come easily, nor was it made quickly.\n\n\"The commitment needed to extract maximum performance while providing sustainability is incredibly demanding, and we've reached a point in our respective personal and business lives where it's time to pass the torch.\"\n\nThe decision by SHR comes after Harvick and Aric Almirola retired, which coincided with the loss of major partners, such as Anheuser-Busch, Smithfield and Hunt Brothers Pizza. The team added Noah Gragson and Josh Berry to its driver lineup this season, with Bass Pro Shops picking up significant inventory on Gragson's car and Overstock.com doing so with Berry.\n\nThere are numerous landing spots for SHR's charters, including Trackhouse Racing, Front Row Motorsports and 23XI Racing, each of which are looking to expand to three full-time entries in 2025. The going rate for the charters will likely be around the $20 to 30 million range based on the high supply rate.\n\nTrackhouse has Ross Chastain and Daniel Suarez under contract, along with Zane Smith and Shane van Gisbergen. Front Row is losing Michael McDowell at the end of the season, but if it purchases another charter, it could absorb part of SHR's Cup operation and its employees. 23XI can either pick up a free agent driver, or it may elevate top Toyota prospect Corey Heim.\n\nSHR has not won a Cup Series race since Harvick's final victory at Richmond in 2022. While the team has begun to show improvements in its performance, it is rumored that they are no longer one of Ford's primary teams. Last year, Harvick was the only SHR driver to qualify for the playoffs compared to 2020, when all four cars made the playoffs.\n\nSHR formed in 2009 after Stewart announce he would depart Joe Gibbs Racing to co-own what was previously known as Haas CNC Racing, which Haas operated.\n\n\"We're proud of all the wins and championships we've earned since joining together in 2009, but even more special is the culture we built and the friendships we forged as we committed to a common cause - winning races and collecting trophies,\" the statement continued. \"That is the same commitment we made to our personnel, our partners and our fans coming into this year, and that commitment will remain through the season finale at Phoenix.\n\n\"We have tremendous respect and appreciation for all of our employees, and we will work diligently to assist them during this transition to find new opportunities beyond the 2024 race season.\"\n\nThe team has 69 Cup wins since it was formed, along with 22 Xfinity Series victories. SHR also won the 2023 Xfinity Series championship with Cole Custer, son of team president Joe Custer.\n\nStewart will continue to own a NHRA team, while Haas will focus on his Formula 1 operation.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart-Haas_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stewart-Haas Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harvick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Harvick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tony Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackhouse_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trackhouse Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23XI_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "23XI Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Smith_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zane Smith (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_Brothers_Pizza", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunt Brothers Pizza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_van_Gisbergen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shane van Gisbergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Gragson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Gragson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aric_Almirola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aric Almirola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Chastain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ross Chastain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McDowell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael McDowell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Row_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Front Row Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anheuser-Busch", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anheuser-Busch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Pro_Shops", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bass Pro Shops"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Heim", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Heim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Xfinity_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Xfinity Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Custer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Custer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gibbs_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gibbs Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6656109b50c7e73f759393ff/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605736", "eventUri": "eng-9605736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

With the retirement of veteran Kevin Harvick, the team currently fields cars for Chase Briscoe, Ryan Preece, Noah Gragson and rookie Josh Berry. And of those four drivers, the only one with a win in the Cup Series is Briscoe, whose sole trip to victory lane came at Phoenix in 2022.\n\nThe only driver that SHR had in the playoffs last year was Harvick, who was eliminated after the first round. And of their other three cars, none finished higher in the final points standings than 22nd, with Briscoe coming in at a disappointing 30th.\n\nNow, the team seems to have made some small improvements this year, with Gragson running the best of the 4 cars and Berry showing some decent performance at times. But for a top NASCAR Cup Series team, it was clear that something was wrong over at Stewart-Haas.\n\nAnd after weeks of rumors and speculation that the team was looking to sell some or all of their charters for next season, the team made it official today and announced to their employees that they would be shutting down after the 2024 season.\n\nIt's not unexpected, as Stewart has been focused mainly on his NHRA team recently and Haas focused on F1. And with no owner invested in the team on a regular basis, it's hard to compete at NASCAR's top level.\n\nBut it's a disappointing end to what was one of the most exciting teams in NASCAR at one point, a team that's fielded cars for drivers like Stewart and Harvick, Ryan Newman, Danica Patrick, Kurt Busch and Clint Bowyer.\n\nIt's currently unclear where the four current SHR drivers will end up next season, with Berry and Gragson both being in their first year with the team. But Briscoe is rumored to be the top choice for the Wood Brothers to replace Harrison Burton in the #21 car when he's inevitably let go after this season, and with four charters on the market teams will be looking to expand their roster and will likely look at the current Stewart-Haas lineup when scouting talent.\n\nFront Row Motorsports is expected to make a bid for at least one charter, and Trackhouse Racing has four drivers currently signed for 2025 while currently only having two charters.

In a rain-shortened NASCAR Coca-Cola 600, Josh Berry came out with a top-10 finish.\n\nThis is the second top-10 in a row for Josh Berry. He has had some solid outings with Stewart-Haas Racing. However, the last few weeks have been eye-opening. It appears that he is getting into a groove and really feeling comfortable in the Next Gen car.\n\nStewart-Haas Racing might not have much of a future left. This could be the swan song. That isn't stopping this team from sticking together through the end.\n\nJosh Berry is more than happy with a top-10.\n\nCrew chief Rodney Childers is right there with him. The driver and crew chief pairing has been really good this year. Childers has a lot of faith in Berry and his team. Now, they just have to keep putting it together.\n\nSpotter Eddie D'Hondt was also congratulatory of the No. 4 team. It hasn't been easy, but they have made it work this season.\n\nThe future of Stewart-Haas Racing will be revealed as soon as this week. However, the writing appears to be on the wall. It will be a fire sale of charters, equipment, and buildings if SHR closes shop for good.\n\nUnforutnately, the race was called short. Josh Berry was moving forward throughout the race and even had strong pit stops to help him maintain or pick up positions. The storms and rain were just too much to overcome for NASCAR.\n\nThere is a lot that could happen to Stewart-Haas Racing. They have four charters, two buildings, and everything else that accumulates over more than a decade in the sport - it can all be up for sale soon enough.\n\nThose charters are going to go for $20-$30 million. Live Fast Motorsports sold a charter to Spire Motorsports last year for $40 million. However, if four charters go on the market, the price is going to go down.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the charter agreement has not been decided upon yet. There is talk that teams moving forward, besides Hendrick and Joe Gibbs who will be grandfathered in, will be limited to three charters. I think the idea is to allow more ownership parties into the sport and avoid hoarding charters among a few teams.\n\nThe last thing that NASCAR wants is nine teams with four charters each. It just isn't great for the sport. I am not sure I like that proposed idea, though.\n\nThat is more or less besides the point - Stewart-Haas Racing is in limbo, but won't be much longer.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_howard@on3.com", "name": "Jonathan Howard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart-Haas_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stewart-Haas Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Childers", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rodney Childers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Gen_(NASCAR)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Next Gen (NASCAR)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_Fast_Motorsports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Live Fast Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire_Motorsports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spire Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gibbs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gibbs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/14074600/denny-hamlin-gives-props-to-josh-berry-rodney-childers-for-third-place-finish-at-darlington.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605736", "eventUri": "eng-9605736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The team, formed in 2009 when Tony Stewart became a co-owner with Gene Haas, currently fields four cars in the Cup Series for Josh Berry, Chase Briscoe, Noah Gragson and Ryan Preece.\n\nSHR's closure comes as the team lost two longtime sponsors at the end of the 2023 season. Busch Light moved to Ross Chastain's No. 1 car at Trackhouse Racing following Kevin Harvick's retirement and Smithfield left NASCAR completely when Aric Almirola retired from full-time competition.\n\nStewart became the first driver-owner to win a NASCAR Cup Series title when he won his third championship driving for SHR in 2011. Three years later, Harvick won the Cup Series title.\n\nSince then, things have slowly trended downwards for the team even as Harvick was a stalwart. Harvick was 13th in the points standings a season ago while Almirola, Briscoe and Preece all finished outside the top 20. The organization went winless across an entire Cup Series season for the first time ever.\n\nRumors of a downsizing or total shuttering have been floated for months as SHR did not have a contract with Ford beyond the 2024 season. Teams typically have their manufacturers lined up years into the future.\n\nThe closure of Stewart-Haas means that teams looking to expand may not have to pay top rate for a charter -- essentially NASCAR's version of a franchise. The 36 cars with charters are guaranteed entry into every single Cup Series race and also a bigger share of prize money.\n\nThe only charter on the market ahead of the 2024 season sold for approximately $40 million when Spire purchased Live Fast Racing's charter in September of 2023. With all four SHR charters now on the market, it'll be a surprise if any of the team's guaranteed entries sell for close to that number.\n\nTrackhouse could be in the market for another charter along with Front Row Motorsports. Trackhouse is loaning Zane Smith to Spire Motorsports in 2024 and an additional charter or two can make room at the two-car team for him and/or Shane van Gisbergen.\n\nThe charter agreement between NASCAR and teams currently limits teams to a maximum of four charters. However, that agreement expires at the end of the 2024 season and the sanctioning body and its teams don't seem close to terms on a new deal. In addition to SHR, Hendrick Motorsports and Joe Gibbs Racing also field four cars.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aric_Almirola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aric Almirola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tony Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackhouse_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trackhouse Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Briscoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Briscoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Preece", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Preece"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Haas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene Haas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Gragson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noah Gragson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Chastain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ross Chastain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart-Haas_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stewart-Haas Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harvick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Harvick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire_Motorsports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spire Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Smith_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zane Smith (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_van_Gisbergen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shane van Gisbergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gibbs_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gibbs Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Row_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front Row Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/00HW791.MKhynuDnO3H2sA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-05/42408670-1d32-11ef-bf75-e51e8da5bc47", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605736", "eventUri": "eng-9605736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

It is a decision that did not come easily, nor was it made quickly.\n\n\"Racing is a labor-intensive, humbling sport. It requires unwavering commitment and vast resources, with a 365-day mindset to be better than everyone else. It's part of what makes success so rewarding.\n\n\"But the commitment needed to extract maximum performance while providing sustainability is incredibly demanding, and we've reached a point in our respective personal and business lives where it's time to pass the torch.\n\n\"We're proud of all the wins and championships we've earned since joining together in 2009, but even more special is the culture we built and the friendships we forged as we committed to a common cause -- winning races and collecting trophies.\n\n\"That is the same commitment we made to our personnel, our partners and our fans coming into this year, and that commitment will remain through the season finale at Phoenix.\n\n\"We have tremendous respect and appreciation for all of our employees, and we will work diligently to assist them during this transition to find new opportunities beyond the 2024 race season.\"\n\nStewart-Haas Racing's four-car Cup team currently fields the Nos. 4, 10, 14 and 41 Fords for drivers Josh Berry, Noah Gragson, Chase Briscoe and Ryan Preece, respectively. Two Xfinity Series teams also carry the SHR banner (Cole Custer, Riley Herbst).\n\nHaas has fielded Cup Series entries each season since 2002, originally under the banner of Haas CNC Racing. In 2008, eventual NASCAR Hall of Famer Stewart joined forces with Haas to form SHR for its inaugural season in 2009, starting with a two-car outfit with drivers Stewart and 2008 Daytona 500 winner Ryan Newman with a technical alliance with Hendrick Motorsports.\n\nMORE: Cup standings\n\nStewart scored the program's first victory in the 2009 NASCAR All-Star Race exhibition, then went to Victory Lane at Pocono Raceway to net the team's first points-paying victory three weeks later. Stewart ultimately scored four wins in the team's inaugural campaign in the No. 14 Chevrolet.\n\nTheir success continued in 2011, when Stewart and outgoing crew chief Darian Grubb won five of the 10 races in the NASCAR Playoffs -- including the season finale -- to claim Stewart-Haas Racing's first NASCAR Cup Series championship, edging Roush Fenway Racing's Carl Edwards (a Class of 2025 NASCAR Hall of Fame inductee) for the title in a tiebreaker.\n\nStewart-Haas Racing expanded to a three-car team for the 2013 season with Danica Patrick in the No. 10 car before adding a fourth car in 2014. Kevin Harvick shifted from Richard Childress Racing to SHR's renumbered No. 4 car with crew chief Rodney Childers after Ryan Newman's departure from the No. 39, and 2004 champion Kurt Busch, who slotted into the team's new No. 41 car.\n\nIn their first year together, Harvick and Childers rocketed to a five-win campaign that resulted in a Cup championship. The pairing lasted a decade, culminating in 37 of Harvick's 60 career wins before his retirement after the 2023 season.\n\nBusch added a milestone win to his resume -- as well as Stewart's -- by winning the 2017 Daytona 500 with crew chief Tony Gibson atop the pit box. Stewart never won the \"Great American Race\" as a driver but celebrated the triumph as a team co-owner in his first season after his Cup driving retirement.\n\nAdditional drivers through SHR's Cup tenure included Clint Bowyer, Aric Almirola, Daniel Su\u00e1rez and Cole Custer.\n\nWhile Stewart-Haas hasn't won since August 2022, when Harvick scored consecutive victories at Michigan International Speedway and Richmond Raceway, the company has collected 69 wins, 339 top fives and 695 top 10s through the 2024 Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com",

(AP) -- Stewart-Haas Racing, a two-time NASCAR championship team with 69 Cup Series victories since its 2009 formation, will close its organization at the end of this season\n\nCo-owners Tony Stewart and Gene Haas announced the decision after nearly a year of rumors that their four-car Cup team was looking to sell its charters and either scale back or exit the stock car series completely. The news was delivered to the nearly 300 SHR employees late Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is a decision that did not come easily, nor was it made quickly,\" the owners said. \"Racing is a labor-intensive, humbling sport. It requires unwavering commitment and vast resources, with a 365-day mindset to be better than everyone else. It's part of what makes success so rewarding. But the commitment needed to extract maximum performance while providing sustainability is incredibly demanding, and we've reached a point in our respective personal and business lives where it's time to pass the torch.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Berry and Gragson are in their first seasons with the team. SHR holds the 2025 option on Briscoe and he has not been permitted to discuss future employment options even as rumors have swirled that SHR would close.\n\n\"Stewart Haas has been home to my family and I for the last 7 years and at the end of the year myself and the entire organization will be looking for a new home and new opportunities in the Cup series,\" Briscoe posted on social media. \"I have amazing partners behind me and can't wait to get them back in victory lane.\"\n\nThe move will also shutter the SHR Xfinity Series team, whose two cars are driven by Cole Custer and Riley Herbst.\n\nGene Haas founded Haas CNC Racing in 2002 and the California businessman lured Stewart in as a co-owner ahead of the 2009 season. Stewart had won two Cup championships for Joe Gibbs Racing at the time but couldn't turn down an equity stake and opportunity to help a small team contend for titles.\n\nStewart in his 2009 debut season gave the rebranded team its first Cup victory -- he won four races that year -- and its first Cup title in 2011. Kevin Harvick added a second championship in 2014.\n\nStewart, Harvick and Clint Bowyer have all retired from NASCAR driving and SHR since then has been in a grueling rebuild. The organization's last Cup Series win was in 2022 with Harvick a year before he retired. SHR didn't win a Cup race last season.\n\nThe team also is set to lose some of its support from Ford at the end of the season, although Mark Rushbrook, the global director of Ford Performance, told The Associated Press last week he had no idea what SHR's plans are beyond this year.\n\nSHR also lost major sponsorship this season when Smithfield Foods exited NASCAR and Anheuser-Busch moved to Trackhouse Racing.\n\nHaas spends most of his time with his Formula 1 team and Stewart is driving a full NHRA schedule, making both absentee owners at NASCAR events. The 71-year-old Haas was also ill for much of last year.\n\nThe NASCAR team is primarily run by Joe Custer, the chief operating officer and longtime Gene Haas confidant. His son, Cole, won the Xfinity championship last year for SHR.\n\nAmong SHR's accomplishments are the two Cup titles, two Xfinity championships and victories that include crown-jewel events such as the Daytona 500, Brickyard 400 and Southern 500.\n\n\"We're proud of all the wins and championships we've earned since joining together in 2009, but even more special is the culture we built and the friendships we forged as we committed to a common cause - winning races and collecting trophies,\" Stewart and Haas said. \"We have tremendous respect and appreciation for all of our employees, and we will work diligently to assist them during this transition to find new opportunities beyond the 2024 race season.\"\n\nPart of Haas' F1 team is run from the Kannapolis-based shop and it is unclear if that will continue or if Haas has plans to also depart from F1.\n\nIt's also not clear what happens to the four charters SHR holds that guarantee entry into the field every week. Spire Motorsports last year bought a charter for $40 million, but the actual charter value fluctuates annually.\n\nTeams are in a bitter fight with NASCAR over charters, which are set to expire at the end of this season. The teams want them made permanent and not renewable but NASCAR has refused to budge on the issue.\n\nShould SHR be able to sell the charters, it appears there is interest from Front Row Motorsports, 23XI Racing and Trackhouse. There is also speculation that Joe Custer may retain one of the charters and run a car for his son.\n\nWhere SHR's drivers land is unknown. Briscoe should be able to start talking to other teams now about his future. The team also held an option for next year on Berry, who doesn't bring much personal sponsorship and got the break of his career when SHR hired him ahead of this season.\n\nGragson's contract was announced as a multi-year deal and has backing from Bass Pro Shops to take to another team. Preece is in a contract year with SHR so was already free to shop around the series.\n\nCole Custer could end up in a car in either Cup or the Xfinity Series with backing of Haas' CNC Automation company, wile Herbst has significant financial backing from Monster Energy that should give him options.\n\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

After making a name for himself in the Xfinity Series behind the wheel of the No. 8 Chevrolet for JR Motorsports, he earned the promotion of a lifetime, replacing the retiring Kevin Harvick at Stewart-Haas Racing.\n\nBerry, who had five wins in the Xfinity Series, spent time filling in for Chase Elliott and Alex Bowman at Hendrick Motorsports last year, and he also spent time as Noah Gragson's replacement after he was released by Legacy Motor Club. His second place finish at Richmond Raceway and two other top 10 finishes showed he was ready for a Cup Series promotion.\n\nThis season, Berry has a top finish of third place at Darlington Raceway and sits in 21st in the point standings.\n\nUnfortunately for Berry, there are rumors of Stewart-Haas Racing selling their charters and possibly even their entire operation before the start of the 2025 season. While nothing is official and there's a chance the Hendersonville, Tennessee native could stay behind the wheel of the No. 4 Ford, signs suggest that Berry may be in need of a new ride yet again.\n\nHere are three possible landing spots for Berry in 2025.\n\nIf Ford are big on keeping Berry and Stewart-Haas Racing are indeed selling charters, Front Row Motorsports could become his next home. It has already been announced that Michael McDowell is set to leave the No. 34 Ford to take over behind the wheel of the No. 71 Chevrolet at Spire Motorsports as Zane Smith presumably moves to Trackhouse Racing Team.\n\nWhile Cole Custer is rumored to be the frontrunner to replace McDowell, Front Row Motorsports could have more than just a two-driver lineup if they buy any of Stewart-Haas Racing's charters.\n\nKeeping Berry in a Ford arguably just as competitive as the one he is in now would be a smooth transition for all involved.", "source": {"uri": "beyondtheflag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beyond the Flag"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart-Haas_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stewart-Haas Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Xfinity_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Xfinity Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JR_Motorsports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JR Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harvick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Harvick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_Motor_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legacy Motor Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Gragson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Gragson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richmond Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlington_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darlington Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackhouse_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trackhouse Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire_Motorsports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spire Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zane_Smith_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zane Smith (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Custer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Custer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McDowell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael McDowell (racing driver)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Row_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Front Row Motorsports"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3544,h_1993,x_0,y_176/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/243/01hy7b0bg6h360tx70g2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605736", "eventUri": "eng-9605736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Pockrass also said \"Legacy, RFK and JTG\" are interested in expanding but are not expected to pick up any of the Stewart-Haas Racing charters.\n\nDale Earnhardt Jr. talked about Stewart-Haas' run potentially coming to an end days before the announcement. While appearing on Dirty Air, the NASCAR legend talked about the cost of a charter and what's next for Tony Stewart and Gene Haas.\n\n\"I heard that their range is $20M to $30M, for a charter. One of the last ones that sold was for $40M, and so now they're kind of going through a bit of a reset. I mean, I know one sold for $40M, but from everything that I've learned, and all the things that we've dug up over the last three or four years, the true value is not near $40M. So yeah, $20M to $25M is more in the ballpark of what I think they should be going for. The question is, will Stewart-Haas sell all four of them? Does Tony Stewart and [Gene] Haas get out entirely? Holy s -- . That would be weird,\" Earnhardt Jr. stated.\n\n\"But I mean, it doesn't seem like there's a lot of -- I don't know. I don't want to speculate. But I hope that Tony Stewart doesn't leave NASCAR entirely. That would suck. I just think he's an icon. He's a motorsports icon. Done it all.\"\n\nStewart-Haas has been a mainstay in NASCAR since Stewart teamed up with Haas in 2009. During its run, Stewart-Haas has won two Cup Series Championships and one Xfinity Series title.\n\n\"We have made the difficult decision to close Stewart-Hass Racing at the conclusion of the 2024 season. Stewart and Haas said in the statement. \"It is a decision that did not come easily, nor was it made quickly. Racing is a labor-intensive, humbling sport.

Haas has a Formula 1 team that has struggled and the three-time Cup champion Stewart started an NHRA drag-racing team a couple of years ago that his wife drove for last year and Stewart is driving for this year.\n\nSHR has struggled in recent years and its hefty support from Ford is set to end after this season. It also lost two major sponsors in Smithfield and Anheuser-Busch prior to this year, so without that Ford support continuing it would have been difficult to sustain a four-car operation.\n\n\"We have made the difficult decision to close Stewart-Haas Racing at the conclusion of the 2024 season,\" Stewart and Haas said in a joint statement. \"It is a decision that did not come easily, nor was it made quickly.\n\n\"Racing is a labor-intensive, humbling sport. It requires unwavering commitment and vast resources, with a 365-day mindset to be better than everyone else. It's part of what makes success so rewarding. But the commitment needed to extract maximum performance while providing sustainability is incredibly demanding, and we've reached a point in our respective personal and business lives where it's time to pass the torch.\"\n\nThe organization has four charters that it can sell, and sources indicated at least three of them will go to existing Cup organizations -- one to Front Row Motorsports, one to 23XI Racing and one to Trackhouse Racing. All three of those organizations indicated they had no comment on any charter acquisitions today. Where the fourth charter goes is not clear.\n\nNot having SHR on the Cup grid will be eye-opening next season. SHR started with Haas operating Haas CNC Racing in 2002. Haas gave Stewart half the team in 2009 for him to come drive and help operate the organization. They won championships in 2011 with Stewart and 2014 with Kevin Harvick.\n\nThe organization has 69 Cup wins with the last coming in 2022 with Harvick, who retired after the 2023 season.\n\n\"We're proud of all the wins and championships we've earned since joining together in 2009, but even more special is the culture we built and the friendships we forged as we committed to a common cause -- winning races and collecting trophies,\" Stewart and Haas said in their statement.\n\n\"That is the same commitment we made to our personnel, our partners and our fans coming into this year, and that commitment will remain through the season finale at Phoenix. We have tremendous respect and appreciation for all of our employees, and we will work diligently to assist them during this transition to find new opportunities beyond the 2024 race season.\"\n\nThe closure leaves Cup drivers Chase Briscoe, Noah Gragson, Josh Berry and Ryan Preece in transition, as well as Xfinity Series drivers Cole Custer and Riley Herbst.\n\nHere's a quick look at what could happen with those drivers:\n\nBriscoe, who is 16th in the Cup standings, is the driver most often mentioned as a possibility to drive for Wood Brothers Racing next year with Harrison Burton on the hot seat as he struggles for the third consecutive year. Briscoe was in an option year with SHR and can now start to have more extensive talks with other teams.\n\nBerry, at 19th in the standings in his rookie season and who has surged over the last month, was under contract with SHR for next year but obviously is now looking for a ride. He doesn't have much personal sponsorship but now will be talking heavily to sponsors and teams. Whether he remains in Cup is still to be determined.\n\nGragson's impressive run in his first season at SHR as he sits 21st in the standings (he'd be 19th if not for a 35-point penalty earlier this year plus what appears to be support from Bass Pro Shops, potentially could give him Cup options either at Front Row Motorsports or other teams.\n\nPreece sits 28th in the standings (he'd be 22nd if not for a 35-point penalty earlier this year) was already looking for next year as his contract was up after this season. His future seems uncertain.\n\nCuster, the former Cup driver and defending Xfinity Series champion who is third in the Xfinity standings, will be driving a car next year but still to be determined whether it is Xfinity or Cup. SHR's Xfinity programs -- it not only fields two cars but also supplies cars to other Ford teams -- could be siphoned off into a new team. Also, if Haas wants to continue involvement in NASCAR, Custer would be the natural driver for his Haas Automation company to sponsor as it has sponsored Custer for several years and Custer's father, Joe, is an SHR executive who has worked on Haas motorsports programs for decades.\n\nHerbst, seventh in the Xfintiy standings, has sponsorship from Monster Energy, and that should give him options, potentially on the Cup side.\n\nFRM (which would have two seats available) and 23XI will be seeking drivers if they obtain charters and would need sponsorship as well for them, making them possible landing spots for Herbst.\n\nTrackhouse already has a logjam of drivers with Ross Chastain, Shane van Gisbergen and Zane Smith currently under contract and Daniel Suarez expecting to sign an extension soon. There is a possibility the new charter system could limit organizations to three charters, and if that happens, Trackhouse would have to form an alliance with another team, keep van Gisbergen in Xfinity next year or release one of its drivers.\n\nLegacy Motor Club, RFK Racing and JTG Daugherty Racing have all considered expansion but are not expected to be in play for any of the SHR charters. Dale Earnhardt Jr. confirmed to FOX Sports last week that JR Motorsports also is not part of those conversations.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"},

Concord USA\n\nSources have confirmed that Stewart-Haas Racing (SHR) will be announcing decisions on its future to employees on Tuesday. Word around the team's headquarters in Kannapolis, North Carolina is that it will divest all four of its charters and cease operations in the Cup Series. Should the rumor translate into reality, Front Row Motorsports (FRM) will be at the forefront to grab at least one of the charters.\n\nWhile not explicitly mentioning Stewart-Haas Racing as their seller, Front Row Motorsports' General Manager Jerry Freeze did admit that they were planning to expand to be a three-car team soon. He also said that the team's owner Bob Jenkins regretted having to downsize from owning three charters a few years back and wants to be running on all engines soon.\n\nHis words to The Athletic went, \"I think we're always looking to expand, to be honest with you, and I think this year there's a lot of chatter about that. Bob has this desire to be three cars; we were at one time, and I think he had a lot of regret that we sold the one charter we had.\" Should the team field another car, it will need a bigger operating space than its current one. That's a requirement that SHR can again help with.\n\nAlong with the charters, team co-owner Tony Stewart is also looking to sell a part of the team's headquarters. FRM could obtain one of the two buildings on the Kannapolis campus and house its Truck Series team there. In the scenario that Jenkins does purchase a charter from Stewart, the other three items could potentially be sold to 23XI Racing, Trackhouse Racing, or Legacy Motor Club.\n\nRyan Preece is a pending free agent for the team. Josh Berry has a year remaining on his contract and Chase Briscoe has an option year that the team holds. When Noah Gragson signed with the team before the ongoing season, his deal was termed a \"multi-year\". However, he isn't certain of his return either. \"The main focus is running good and hopefully the opportunity presents itself,\" he said.\n\nBriscoe is a driver that many teams will be pleased to sign if he isn't wearing SHR colors in 2025. He has been associated with Ford for a long time now which connects him to a potential seat with Wood Brothers Racing.

Then they evolved into rumors that Stewart-Haas Racing could shut down entirely.\n\nNow the Stewart and Gene Haas-owned organization, winners of the 2011 and 2014 Cup Series championships, have confirmed that they will indeed shut down at the end of the 2024 season.\n\nThe decision comes less than a year after the team wrapped up their first winless season since becoming Stewart-Haas Racing in 2009, when Stewart joined forces with Haas.\n\nThrough the first 14 races of the 2024 season, none of their four drivers or cars are above the playoff cut line, and none of them managed to race their way into the All-Star Race.\n\nThis is a team that led the series in wins with 12 in 2018 and 10 in 2020. They have 69 victories total, most recently Kevin Harvick's final victory at Richmond Raceway in August 2022.\n\nThe decision brings to the forefront two major questions. First, where do their four charters go? And second, where do the four drivers go?\n\nFront Row Motorsports, 23XI Racing, and Trackhouse Racing Team are said to be the frontrunners to acquire a Stewart-Haas Racing charter. Where the fourth one ends up remains to be seen. Regardless, four charters becoming available at once should effectively reset the charter market, to an extent, after years and years of skyrocketing prices.\n\nAs for the drivers, Josh Berry, Chase Briscoe, Noah Gragson, and Ryan Preece are now looking for new rides.

SHR's four charters, effectively NASCAR's version of franchise licenses, are to be sold off over the coming weeks and months. SHR's choice to either downsize or outright shut down is something the team has been moving toward for some time. Several other team owners have either already submitted bids or expressed interest in doing so, according to sources involved in the bidding process.\n\n\"The commitment needed to extract maximum performance while providing sustainability is incredibly demanding, and we've reached a point in our respective personal and business lives where it's time to pass the torch,\" Stewart and Haas said in a joint statement. \"We're proud of all the wins and championships we've earned since joining together in 2009, but even more special is the culture we built and the friendships we forged as we committed to a common cause -- winning races and collecting trophies.\n\n\"That is the same commitment we made to our personnel, our partners and our fans coming into this year, and that commitment will remain through the season finale at Phoenix.\"\n\nSince its 2009 formation, SHR has won 69 Cup races and two championships (Stewart in 2011 and Kevin Harvick in 2014). Only Hendrick Motorsports (six titles) and Team Penske (three) have won more championships during this span.\n\nSHR has four Cup drivers under contract: Josh Berry, Chase Briscoe, Noah Gragson and Ryan Preece. The future for drivers, crew chiefs and other employees within the organization -- which also fields two lower-level Xfinity Series teams -- is unclear.\n\nBerry has a year left on his two-year contract, SHR has an option on Briscoe's contract that must be exercised by this summer, Preece's contract is out at the end of the season, while Gragson has recently indicated that a return to SHR is not certain.\n\nSHR's origins date back to 2003 when Haas, a California billionaire, began fielding a Cup team on a part-time basis before eventually taking that team full-time in 2003.\n\nFrustrated by the lack of high-level success and wanting to break through and finally win, Haas enticed Stewart to leave the well-established Joe Gibbs Racing, where Stewart had won two championships, to join his fledgling team in 2009 by offering him an ownership stake in the team.\n\nWith Stewart's transformative ability behind the wheel, his star power off the track and his knowledge of how to build a championship-caliber organization, combined with Haas' business acumen and deep pocketbook, the renamed Stewart-Haas Racing quickly became a dominating force.\n\nStewart delivered four race victories in his first season. Then came a championship in 2011 that came in rollicking fashion with him winning five of 10 playoff races.\n\nIn addition to Stewart, SHR also signed several big stars during its initial years and touted a robust lineup of major sponsors. Most notably was Harvick, Stewart's good friend who joined in 2014 and brought Anheuser-Busch with him as his primary sponsor. That same year Harvick won SHR its second championship. And over the next several years he was a perennial title contender.\n\nThe 2020 season was SHR's last great campaign. Harvick won a series-best nine races and ran away with the regular-season points championship, but what appeared a surefire championship run ended with a surprising elimination in the semi-final playoff round.\n\nSHR has experienced a gradual decline since 2021. Its four Cup teams have combined to win just four races, including a winless 2023 season and, thus far, a winless 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, SHR's downfall coincides with increased criticism of Stewart and Haas that their involvement in the team has decreased. Both Stewart and Haas own teams in other motorsports series -- Stewart owns a multi-car NHRA team that he also drives for full-time, while Haas owns a Formula One team. That each seemingly focuses most of their attention on these ventures over SHR hasn't gone unnoticed.\n\nEven though the demise of SHR seemed to be coming for months, the downfall is difficult to grasp. Only four years ago, SHR won 10 races and saw all four drivers make the playoffs -- a quarter of the entire NASCAR Cup Series playoff field. The idea such a major team could go away seemed unthinkable at the time, but the decline has been swift and sudden.\n\nChampionship-winning teams don't typically disappear, although 2017 Cup winner Furniture Row Racing shut its doors after the previous financial model grew too unwieldy for team owner Barney Visser. But aside from that, every championship team in the 2000s still exists, which underscores how unusual this is. Teams that shut their doors are typically less-funded, smaller teams that find they can no longer compete in today's Cup Series. But a powerhouse four-car team -- one of just three remaining in Cup -- and funded by a billionaire? That just doesn't happen. -- Jeff Gluck, motorsports staff writer\n\nThere's nothing \"silly\" about people losing their jobs, but SHR's news has already set off a scramble within the industry to find positions at other teams. That includes drivers, crew chiefs, crew members and everyone in between, but the drivers will obviously get the bulk of the attention.\n\nWhat happens to Briscoe, who was viewed as the flagship driver after Harvick's departure? What about rookie Berry, who has barely gotten to show what he's capable of? Or Gragson, who has seemingly raced his way into a ride with a better-than-expected performance this season? Questions about Preece and the Xfinity Series drivers remain as well, and it will certainly be interesting to see where crew chief Rodney Childers lands (and if he'll be able to stay with his new driver Berry).\n\nEither way, it's an unfortunate and sad situation for an operation of roughly 300 people who will now have to figure out what their futures hold. -- Gluck", "source": {"uri":

The payouts can change based on where the team ranks in owner points.\n\nHowever, the current charter agreement expires at the conclusion of this year and there is yet no new deal. That means, in essence, there are no charters for SHR to sell until an agreement is reached.\n\nSince the charters were introduced, they have increased more than 10 times in value. Spire Motorsports purchased Live Fast Motorsports' charter reportedly for around $40 million last year.\n\nThere has been an air of uncertainty around SHR's future for some time.\n\nOnce a dominant force in the Cup Series, the team has failed to win a Cup race in nearly two years. When Kevin Harvick and Aric Almirola retired from full-time competition at the end of last year, major backers Busch Beer and Smithfield left as well.\n\nThe team entered 2024 with four young drivers and just one Cup win between them. Although they have shown slight overall improvement in comparison to last year, the team is still nowhere near where a four-car operation is expected to be.\n\nJoe Gibbs Racing and Hendrick Motorsports are the only other teams that possesses four charters. Both have won several races and hold seven of the top eight spots in the championship standings. The highest SHR driver is Chase Briscoe in 16th.\n\nThe news leaves unclear futures for Briscoe, as well as his team-mates Noah Gragson, Josh Berry, and Ryan Preece. There's also intrigue involving the future of SHR's veteran crew chiefs, especially Rodney Childers, who has scored 40 wins from atop the pit box, earning the bulk of SHR's victories with Harvick. Previously, he guided Michael Waltrip Racing to its first-ever win with David Reutimann in 2009, as well as its last victory with Brian Vickers in 2013.\n\nSHR has 69 wins at the Cup level and last visited Victory Lane with Harvick at Richmond Raceway in August 2022. Stewart delivered the team its first championship in 2011 while Harvick earned the team's second title in 2014.\n\nThe fall-off for SHR has been staggering. It won 26 races between 2018 and 2020, only to win a total of four in the three seasons that followed.\n\nIn 2020, all four SHR drivers made the playoffs. In 2023, three of their four teams missed the cut. Harvick was the only driver to make the 16-driver field last year but was eliminated after the first round.\n\nThe loss of the SHR organization would also leave a significant hole in Ford Performance's NASCAR Cup program.

It is a decision that did not come easily, nor was it made quickly.\n\n\"Racing is a labor-intensive, humbling sport. It requires unwavering commitment and vast resources, with a 365-day mindset to be better than everyone else. It's part of what makes success so rewarding.\n\n\"But the commitment needed to extract maximum performance while providing sustainability is incredibly demanding, and we've reached a point in our respective personal and business lives where it's time to pass the torch.\n\n\"We're proud of all the wins and championships we've earned since joining together in 2009, but even more special is the culture we built and the friendships we forged as we committed to a common cause - winning races and collecting trophies.\n\n\"That is the same commitment we made to our personnel, our partners and our fans coming into this year, and that commitment will remain through the season finale at Phoenix.\n\n\"We have tremendous respect and appreciation for all of our employees, and we will work diligently to assist them during this transition to find new opportunities beyond the 2024 race season.\"\n\nAbout Stewart-Haas Racing:\n\nStewart-Haas Racing is the title-winning NASCAR team co-owned by three-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Tony Stewart and Gene Haas, founder of Haas Automation - the largest CNC machine tool builder in North America.

Now, he's updated his prediction with a time, as well.\n\n\"If any SHR news comes today, would expect it to more than likely come out late afternoon,\" Pockrass wrote this morning, believing that if there's any news regarding the team, it'll come later in the news cycle.\n\nThe rumors have been swirling, with many around the sport theorizing Stewart-Haas Racing could leave the sport as a whole, at the least ending their Cup Series participation. That's certainly leaving their drivers, Chase Briscoe, Noah Gragson, Ryan Preece and Josh Berry, in a precarious position.\n\nRegardless, it seems as if even their wheelmen don't know what's going to happen, as Briscoe, who grew up a huge Tony Stewart fan, has been kept in the dark, he told Pockrass.\n\n\"I am not really allowed to [talk to other teams] until somebody tells me what I can do -- until they tell me if they're picking me back up for next year or if there is a next year, nobody really knows for next year,\" Briscoe said at Darlington, via Pockrass.\n\n\"I push for answers, but nobody knows anything. It's crazy. I feel like when there are rumors people know stuff, but it seems nobody knows anything.\"\n\nAs for Gragson, he just returned to the Cup Series with Stewart-Haas Racing, and it's been a formidable marriage so far. He's not stressing over the situation though, and he believes he'll land of his feet regardless of the outcome.\n\n\"There are some nights that you think, 'Man I don't know what's going to happen' and then I just try to remind myself to focus on trying to run good for this week and just being present-minded and whatnot,\" Gragson said, via Pockrass. \"It's a tough sport as it is and when you've got those type of distractions, it doesn't make it any easier.\"\n\n\"You can't stress over it too much, but definitely want to try and be in the know. I have a great business manager. ... But at the end of the day, it does somewhat at this time of year keep you up at night if you don't have anything signed. I don't have anything right now signed for next year and don't know the future, but I know I'm in good hands.\"\n\nAlas, Tuesday will likely be a major day for Stewart-Haas Racing, as an announcement seems to be coming. We'll see if they stay in the Cup Series with a downsized team, or if the team decides to leave the sport entirely after immense success over the last decade and change.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_samra@on3.com", "name": "Steve Samra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart-Haas_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stewart-Haas Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Pockrass", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Pockrass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Briscoe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chase Briscoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Preece", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Preece"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Gragson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Gragson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darlington_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darlington Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Stewart"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/02/06180847/tony-stewart-tired-of-taking-the-blame-for-stewart-haas-racing-lack-of-success-in-recent-years-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605736", "eventUri": "eng-9605736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Here are the top options", "body": "Only a select number of NASCAR organizations can provide a driver the realistic expectation of contending for race wins, playoff berths and championship-round appearances on a yearly basis. Should such an opportunity -- a potentially career-altering one -- open up, that ride becomes coveted because of the possibilities it offers.\n\nStewart-Haas Racing is one of those elite organizations. The team co-owned by Tony Stewart and Gene Haas has won two championships over the past dozen years, the same number as Joe Gibbs Racing and trailing only Hendrick Motorsports (four) and Team Penske (three) during this span. And now, with Kevin Harvick announcing last week that he's retiring after the 2023 season, SHR's No. 4 car has a vacancy that needs filling.\n\nYet unlike most occasions when a team the caliber of SHR has an opening, the candidate pool to replace Harvick doesn't appear to be as deep as it normally would. Over the past year, Kyle Larson, William Byron, Christopher Bell, Erik Jones, Ryan Blaney and Joey Logano all signed multi-year contract extensions with their respective teams, while Kyle Busch and Tyler Reddick joined new teams under multi-year deals.\n\nEach of the aforementioned eight drivers would've been a worthy successor to Harvick, giving SHR a driver possessing the talent to consistently challenge for wins and championships. And had Harvick announced last January that 2022 would be his swan song, it stands to reason that SHR would've had an interest in signing one of them to drive the No. 4. Alas, SHR is now looking at a whittled-down list of options and the distinct possibility it won't be able to land an A-tier replacement.\n\nSo then, based on the current landscape, what direction does SHR go? The Athletic spoke to multiple people across the NASCAR industry to gauge who should be considered a realistic candidate, and while the list of potential replacements looks much different than it would've a year ago, the consensus is that solid options still exist.\n\nThe most cited name was Ross Chastain. The star driver is entering the final year of his contract with Trackhouse Racing. He was described by one person as a \"home run hire that would give SHR little drop-off on the performance side.\" Helping his candidacy is that he has a personality that appeals to sponsors -- a potentially key factor as it's unknown whether Harvick's longtime primary sponsor, Anheuser-Busch, will continue its support or also depart.\n\nChastain demonstrated in 2022 what he's capable of when he has a team around him, winning two races and finishing runner-up in the championship. But the question is whether SHR represents a enough of an upgrade over Trackhouse to entice the loyal Chastain to leave the team that provided him a big break. A strong bond exists between Chastain and team owner Justin Marks, making it hard to envision Chastain foregoing that relationship for an unknown entity where he may not fit as well.\n\nThe other most cited name was Jones, even though he's in the first year of a multi-year contract with the rebranded Legacy Motor Club. As his pair of Southern 500 wins can attest, Jones' talent is unmistakable. At age 26, he brings with him the capability to be a mainstay that SHR can build around for the next decade-plus.\n\nThat Jones is under contract to Legacy presents a hurdle, though not insurmountable. Contract buyouts can and do happen -- like last season when 23XI Racing untangled Reddick's final year of his contract with Richard Childress Racing.\n\nOf course, both SHR and Jones would have to want this, and there's no certainty on this front. SHR has had the opportunity to sign Jones twice previously and passed both times, so what would be different about this go-round? And would Jones, who's established a home at Legacy where he's viewed as the main guy, want to again experience life at a four-car behemoth after a rough ending at the similarly sized JGR?\n\nBeyond Chastain and Jones, the alternatives become a lot less clear-cut.\n\nAlex Bowman and Daniel Su\u00e1rez are on expiring contracts with their respective teams, Hendrick and Trackhouse. But leaving their situation seems unlikely. Hendrick and sponsor Ally are happy with Bowman, while Su\u00e1rez, who drove for SHR in 2019, is quite settled at Trackhouse. Although things can always change, a whole lot would have to unexpectedly shift to see either jumping.\n\nStaying in-house, SHR could always tab Cole Custer or Riley Herbst, both of whom drive for the team's Xfinity Series program. Promoting either, however, would elicit more of a collective shrug reaction than a \"wow\" that the team should want in naming Harvick's successor. Custer largely underperformed in three Cup seasons and needs a monster season in Xfinity to reestablish himself. Herbst is winless in 109 career Xfinity starts and his spot on SHR's roster has more to do with the funding he brings than his results.\n\nAnother name to watch from the lower divisions is reigning Truck Series champion Zane Smith. He's part of the Ford program, and that association cannot be ignored as Ford-supported SHR goes through this process. The 23-year-old is regarded as a top prospect, earning praise for a smooth style that doesn't lend itself to over-driving -- a characteristic you don't often see from young drivers.\n\nIf SHR is unable to secure a long-term solution, a stopgap for a year or two could be in play. A name often identified under this scenario is Michael McDowell. The veteran has done a lot with a little at Front Row Motorsports, including a Daytona 500 win in 2021 and last year setting highs in top-10 finishes, laps led, average starting position and average finishing position. He'd likely acquit himself well at a powerhouse team, and SHR could do a lot worse than having McDowell serve as a bridge.\n\nAnd there is the very real possibility that SHR elects to go with a candidate not on this board, someone unforeseen. After all, what were the odds last year on Kyle Busch not re-signing with JGR to join the team owned by someone who once punched him? Yet that unlikelihood is now a reality.\n\nWhatever direction Stewart and Haas go, who's behind the wheel of the SHR No. 4 car in 2024 is guaranteed to be a dominant storyline until a decision is made.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_bianchi@nytimes.com", "name": "Jordan Bianchi", "type": "author", "isAgency":

The Tony Stewart-Gene Haas owned racing team has been on the verge of extinction for over a month now with rumors of it becoming obsolete gathering strength. Before the team owners call it quits officially, former racer Kenny Wallace wants them to look the way of RFK Racing.\n\nStewart-Haas Racing is currently a four-car team. What Wallace wants to be considered is the possibility of it continuing as a three-car or a two-car team. He believes that the chances of winning a championship do not go down by downsizing, as is evident from the success of Team Penske in 2022 and 2023.\n\nHe also further reiterated that the new business model does not make running a four-car team financially more efficient than it does a two-car team. He cited RFK Racing and Brad Keselowski to make his case saying, \"I'm hoping they look at Roush Racing. I'm hoping Stewart-Haas Racing says that 'Look over there at Jack Roush. They have two teams. They have Chris Buescher and Brad Keselowski.\"\n\nHe continued to express that by taking notes from the Roush team, Stewart will be able to find the sense in becoming a team with just two entries in the Cup Series. Whatever the three-time champion decides will soon come to light. Expectations are that he and his companions in the top brass will announce decisions regarding the future to SHR employees on Tuesday.\n\nVeteran reporters Jeff Gluck and Jordan Bianchi confirmed on their podcast recently that the SHR heads will meet with drivers and other personnel at the team's headquarters in Kannapolis to let them know of their decisions regarding the future. Bianchi said, \"It is expected that on Tuesday, Stewart-Haas Racing is going to make their future known.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gowtham_ramalingam@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Gowtham Ramalingam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart-Haas_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stewart-Haas Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFK_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RFK Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Roush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Roush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Keselowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brad Keselowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Buescher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Buescher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannapolis,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kannapolis, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kannapolis, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 27}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/07/8845a1a6-untitled-design-8.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605736", "eventUri": "eng-9605736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Stewart's hard-edged, no-excuses-tolerated mentality would become the underlying characteristic that defined SHR. The billionaire Haas was the money man willing to spend what it took to bring his then-struggling Haas CNC Racing team the success it never found.\n\nAlmost instantly, Stewart and Haas delivered on their promises, with a fast rise to powerhouse status. Stewart won four times in his first year as co-owner, then won the 2011 championship two years later. The team had an array of high-profile sponsors and continued to make key free-agent signings, including landing Kevin Harvick, who then won the team its second title in 2014.\n\nJust as Stewart and Haas said the team would, SHR had shoved its way into NASCAR's penthouse alongside elite organizations such as Hendrick Motorsports, Joe Gibbs Racing and Team Penske. And similar to Hendrick, JGR and Penske, all of which have been NASCAR teams for 30-plus years, SHR seemingly had planted firm roots that ensured it would continue for decades.\n\nExcept SHR is no Hendrick, JGR or Penske. The SHR dynasty is not only over, its days as an operational Cup team have a definitive end date. On Tuesday, Stewart and Haas announced their team will shut down at the end of the year.\n\nNASCAR is better with teams like SHR, those committed to winning, on its grid. And SHR has done plenty of winning since first hitting the track in 2009; only Hendrick (six titles) and Penske (four) have amassed more championships during this span.\n\nBut the key tenet of most long-standing teams is strong leadership. It's why Hendrick, JGR and Penske have experienced lasting success on the track. At SHR, though, a lack of leadership is why SHR is no longer viewed as a powerhouse within the garage. And why it will soon cease to exist.\n\nDespite their public stance that they are very involved, Stewart and Haas have effectively become absentee owners in recent years. They aren't regularly at the track. Each has other racing ventures where they'd rather spend their time. Stewart is both an owner and driver in NHRA. Haas owns a Formula One team.\n\nIt is their prerogative to choose where to spend their time, but while Stewart and Haas have been focused elsewhere, their NASCAR dynasty has crumbled. SHR has become a facsimile of the organization it once was. This despite having an array of talented drivers, crew chiefs, engineers and others behind the scenes, all of whom have been given little support in recent years but still grind out solid results.\n\nA telling glimpse as to why SHR has suffered a rapid downward spiral: Two weeks ago, Harvick, who retired after the 2023 season after 10 years with SHR, returned in a one-off at the All-Star Race to practice and qualify Kyle Larson's Hendrick-owned car. With this being Harvick's first opportunity to work closely with a Hendrick team and see how they operate, the 2014 Cup champion was asked to compare and contrast the two organizations.\n\n\"I heard from the owner twice in two weeks, so that's different,\" Harvick said. \"It's interesting to see just the race shop, the structure and the way that everybody goes about it differently.\n\n\"There's a million different ways you can do things. The thing that sticks out for me about Hendrick Motorsports in general, it's truly run like a business that is part of an actual structure of how things flow and who you talk to. There's just the depth of the business side and the racing side, it's deep. That's pretty eye-opening -- just the structure from the whole thing. And I like structure. That's something that has been good to see. ...\n\n\"(At SHR), I had a very special group of people that succeeded in a structure that wasn't as structured in what we're in in this situation (at Hendrick). I had a lot of success at Stewart-Haas Racing, and all the things we did I'm super proud of and love the relationships that we have, but it's just different, vastly different cultures.\"\n\nHarvick's words speak volumes as to why SHR did not fulfill its potential. Leadership, culture and structure matter significantly. It is why great teams remain great.\n\nSuch guiding principles define organizations like Hendrick. They once defined SHR too. But all this is in the past. Not the present, and definitely not the future.\n\nThis was made known on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_bianchi@nytimes.com", "name": "Jordan Bianchi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Penske", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team Penske"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Gibbs_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Gibbs Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tony Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart-Haas_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stewart-Haas Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Haas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene Haas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harvick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Harvick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_All-Star_Race", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR All-Star Race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Celebrity_Homemakers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Celebrity Homemakers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/28172216/GettyImages-465475679-scaled.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605736", "eventUri": "eng-9605736", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2008-07-", "textStart": 50, "textEnd": 59}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

And if such an opportunity does materialize, it often involves the driver bringing considerable funding with them to underwrite the chance even if their talent merits it.\n\nJosh Berry is the exception.\n\nNext year, Berry, who will turn 33 in October, will be in Cup where he'll drive Stewart-Haas Racing's No. 4 car, replacing the retired Kevin Harvick. It's a plum opportunity with a top organization, the kind of job a driver dreams about securing.\n\nAnd that SHR, co-owned by Gene Haas and Tony Stewart, tabbed Berry to fill Harvick's spot is a bit improbable. Such opportunities aren't often afforded to drivers of Berry's ilk -- though he is certainly deserving.\n\n\"I'm not interested in some kid's father coming in and buying their way into the Cup Series. I have zero interest in that,\" Stewart said. \"We want guys who earn their way, work hard, understand the values it takes to be a top-tier driver -- not one who just got his high school diploma and now all of a sudden he's a Cup driver.\n\n\"Josh has put the time and effort in. Every time he's got an opportunity, he's made the most of it, and that's the traits that championship drivers are built off of, not the easy ticket to get there.\"\n\nIf Stewart sought a driver who scraped, fought and persevered to finally get a coveted shot at the big time with a big-time team, then Berry certainly fits that description.\n\nA Hendersonville, Tenn., native, Berry was racing Legend cars at Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway in 2008 when on a whim he decided to reach out to Dale Earnhardt Jr. for advice. A friendship was born and a few years later Berry, who worked full-time as a bank teller to supplement his income, reached out to Earnhardt when he found himself at a career crossroads. He wanted to keep racing, progressing up the developmental ladder, except he lacked funding.\n\nImpressed by Berry's ability and determination, Earnhardt offered Berry the chance in 2010 to drive for his Late Model team that competed across the Mid-Atlantic region. It required that Berry relocate to the Charlotte area, and since Berry knew few people and had nowhere to live, he moved in with Earnhardt's mom. Before too long, he had become a member of the family.\n\nMaking the most of the opportunity, Berry won numerous races and multiple championships in various divisions. Occasional starts with the Xfinity Series team Earnhardt co-owned eventually came Berry's way, and more often than not he delivered impressive results, including a seventh at Richmond in Sept. 2015.\n\nFor sure sponsors would come calling, Earnhardt thought, and Berry would soon be in Xfinity on a permanent basis.\n\nNot quite. A lack of sponsorship continued to be a foreboding roadblock.\n\nDespite possessing talent and even with Earnhardt's unwavering support, a full-time opportunity didn't come Berry's way until 2022. In the meantime, he continued to make the most of his chances, winning his first Xfinity race in 2021 and another later that season. That first one came at Martinsville, which Earnhardt admitted made him cry \"like if he was my brother. It's hard to describe the emotion, but it was incredible.\"\n\nOn the Cup side, Berry earned a spot filling in this spring at Hendrick Motorsports when two of its Cup drivers, Chase Elliott and Alex Bowman, missed time due to injury. Further demonstrating he was ready for Cup, Berry dazzled, including a second-place finish at Richmond.\n\n\"The best evidence is exactly what he did in (filling in for Elliott and Bowman),\" Harvick said. \"I mean, jumping into those cars when the seats don't fit, he doesn't know the people very well and being competitive and figuring it out.\"\n\nBut while NASCAR starts may have been infrequent, folks were watching. Harvick's championship-winning crew chief, Rodney Childers, himself a former driver in many of the grassroots series Berry competed in, was paying attention. So too were other notable decision-makers within the organization. When SHR chief competition officer Greg Zipadelli began doing research on Berry, he quickly surmised that he was an ideal fit.\n\n\"His want and willingness to work,\" Zipadelli said regarding what traits stood out. \"... We felt like he was mentally strong, was able to deal with different sorts of circumstances, and he's been good at a lot of different racetracks.\"\n\nSometime over the offseason, an SHR executive walked into Childers' office with a quasi-mandate. Harvick, the 2014 Cup champion, was retiring after the 2023 season and SHR needed to start putting together a list of potential replacements. The organization wanted Childers' feedback, making it clear his opinion carried significant weight.\n\nThe crew chief went home and thoroughly researched who was available, who'd be a good fit and who could handle the pressure of filling the shoes of a driver considered one of NASCAR's all-time best. One name immediately stood out. Excited by the chance to work with Berry, Childers elected to stay on as crew chief of the No. 4 team instead of opting for a behind-the-scenes role with SHR that got him off the road.\n\n\"I think everybody knows that I'm a Josh Berry fan,\" Childers said. \"I told the shop guys at Stewart-Haas this morning that I wish they could all go back through (Berry's) phone and count how many times that I text him saying if that guy could ever get the right opportunity, he's going to show something.\"\n\nSimilar to Childers, the triumvirate of Stewart, Harvick and Zipadelli had Berry's name atop their lists. It didn't matter to any of them that Berry was in his 30s, well past an age when most talented drivers have already advanced to Cup.\n\nIn fact, that Berry was older worked to his advantage.\n\n\"Josh is sort of a good example of how maybe it might turn back the other direction,\" Earnhardt said. \"You don't have to be 18 to 20 years old rushing through the Xfinity Series. That there's guys that take their time to develop in the Truck and Xfinity Series, get out of there at 24, 25, 26 years old and start driving cars at 27, 28 years old and be great.\"\n\nSaid Harvick: \"He's been dragged through the mud and had good times and bad times and figured out how to make it to the next event and be successful.\"\n\nBerry represents an anomaly. Drivers his age aren't supposed to be handpicked to replace a certain Hall of Famer in Harvick.\n\nYet there he was Wednesday afternoon sharing a dais with Stewart, Harvick, Childers and Zipadelli. The four longtime SHR employees spoke glowingly about the team's newest hire and how he had earned this chance.\n\n\"It's just cool as crap today to see him up here with us, to be able to go racing with him and to have that same common goal,\" Childers said.\n\n\"Turnkey\" was a word mentioned a few times on Wednesday. Because of his age, Berry possesses a level of maturity often absent in most young drivers moving to Cup, something that should work to his advantage next year when he will in all likelihood be the oldest rookie on the grid.\n\n\"It's important to have seasoned, experienced, mature people because Cup racing, especially when you're just starting, can eat you up,\" Harvick said. \"And it usually eats you up because of the pressure or the questions and all the stuff outside of the car, and then it starts to affect what you do inside of the car. So having somebody that can deal with that in a mature way right off the bat is important.\"\n\nPerhaps if Berry does well, Earnhardt said, other teams may be inclined to give older drivers a chance. Even if they aren't bringing funding with them.\n\nTime will tell. Just the fact, though, that Berry is in this position serves as inspiration to other grassroots drivers out there who've been told they're too old and/or lack the necessary money.\n\n\"He definitely should be. Absolutely,\" Stewart said. \"This should be an inspiration to drivers that put the work in, put the time in, that if you do the right things, you win enough races, you're going to get enough eyes on you that you'll get an opportunity, eventually.\"\n\nIn many ways, Berry's background is similar to that of Stewart's or Harvick's. And it's why he is unquestionably the logical choice to drive the No. 4 SHR car in 2024.\n\n\"There's a small group of those true racers like Josh that just put their head down,\" Harvick said, \"and it's just, 'Hey, I need to go out and win this week. I got to put food on the table and survive so I'm going to go race here, I'm going to go race there and if I don't do good at my Xfinity opportunity, I'm not going to get a Cup opportunity.' And when you can survive in those life-or-death situations and be successful and take it to the next step and use that as a stepping stone to the next opportunity, those are the guys that you want.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_bianchi@nytimes.com", "name": "Jordan Bianchi", "type": "author", "isAgency":

No contract has been signed yet, per the sources. Here's what you need to know:\n\nDuring Berry's eight-race stint as a Hendrick fill-in for its Nos. 9 and 48 teams, he finished in the top 10 three times, with a best result of second at Richmond Raceway last month. Last Sunday at North Wilkesboro Speedway, driving in place of Bowman, he won a qualifying race to earn a spot in the All\u2010Star Race.\n\n\"You don't really see his aggressiveness until he needs it, which is what you want in every driver,\" Hendrick vice chairman Jeff Gordon said after the April 2 race at Richmond. \"You want them to be patient when they need to be patient and aggressive when they need to be aggressive, and he seems to have that ability.\n\n\"Josh has done an excellent job; he's really put a lot of effort into it.\"\n\nBerry's path to NASCAR's premier series is unlike that of many drivers who've recently advanced to Cup, a blue-collar journey that's made him popular with many fans. The 32-year-old didn't race full time in Xfinity until last season, at an age that many drivers have already moved to the Cup level, nor had the financial backing to bring to a prospective team to hasten his path up NASCAR's developmental ladder.\n\nBut with the continued adamant support of his good friend Earnhardt, who he drove for in regional races across the Mid-Atlantic for several years, Berry eventually secured a full-time opportunity with Earnhardt's Xfinity team. In 73 total starts, he's won five races and finished fourth in the championship last year.\n\nWhat Berry has done in Xfinity, combined with his impressive performance substituting for Elliott and Bowman, raised Berry's stock to where he was one of the top available drivers on the market.\n\n\"I've learned a lot about myself in the last five weeks,\" Berry said April 15 during the weekend of Elliott's return. \"It's definitely different than Xfinity racing, but I feel like I was thrown into a pretty difficult situation, and I think we left all very positive about the experience. I think it just did a lot for my confidence. I'm really grateful for that experience and what it did for me.\n\n\"We'll see what the future holds. I'd love to be racing a Cup car, but right now I'm just trying to stay focused on this (JRM) team. We keep working hard building fast race cars, we'll win races and I'll probably be in the Cup Series.\"\n\nSHR, co-owned by Tony Stewart and Gene Haas, seeks a driver after Harvick announced in January that the coming season would be his final one before stepping away. Harvick, who's competed in Cup since 2001, joined SHR in 2014 and during his stellar tenure with the organization won a series\u2010best 37 races during that span, the 2014 series championship, and five times earned a berth in the Championship Four -- all with Childers as his crew chief.\n\nSHR is regarded as one of NASCAR's big four teams and Childers is one of the top crew chiefs in the garage, meaning Berry is stepping into a situation that presents an opportunity to be competitive. It also represents a manufacturer change for Berry, who's been aligned with Chevrolet but will now drive for Ford\u2010backed SHR.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_bianchi@nytimes.com", "name": "Jordan Bianchi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Raceway", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richmond Raceway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wilkesboro_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Wilkesboro Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart-Haas_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stewart-Haas Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Am_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trans-Am Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Haas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gene Haas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_professional_sports_leagues_in_the_United_States_and_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/05/25095955/josh-berry-racing-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605736", "eventUri": "eng-9605736", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-02", "textStart": 844, "textEnd": 851}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-15", "textStart": 2086, "textEnd": 2094}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

As marquee drivers and personnel changes are made, The Athletic will offer an analysis on what the move means.\n\nKevin Harvick confirmed Saturday he has signed a two-year contract extension; thereafter, Stewart-Haas Racing's grand designs rapidly crystallized.\n\nHis new agreement takes him through his age-47 season, an age we haven't seen NASCAR Cup drivers regularly attempt to surpass since the turn of the millennium. A glance at the average driver's aging curve suggests drivers are past their statistical peak after age 39 and fall into decline -- sometimes precipitously -- after age 41. He's managed to sustain his prime-age production powers. Such a feat might have convinced him to press forward despite an eventual decline to chase a second championship with a team tailored to his specific talents.\n\nAn initial sign of decline might have already occurred. Harvick's previously reliable passing fell below par in 2019, the first time he turned in a negative surplus passing value since the metric's invention in 2014. It cost him five positions from his expected pass differential (a 156-position swing from his effort the previous year). He led the series in SPV, which measures pass efficiency, in 2016 and ranked second in 2015 and in 2018 (he ranked 13th in 2019). Per a regression analysis, his 2020 season is projected for a Production in Equal Equipment Rating in line with the 3.347 he earned last year, which ranked fourth but represented a 1.500-point drop from a career-best mark in 2018.\n\nBut the new commitment to SHR likely has little to do with statistics. Harvick has long eyed the TV booth but there's no clear seat available and NASCAR's agreement with network partners Fox and NBC doesn't conclude until after the 2024 season. He recently announced he's cutting back on the number of cameo broadcasting appearances for support races to spend time more with his wife and two children.\n\nThe notion of delaying his foray into broadcasting is music to the ears of SHR, a well-built, engineering-centric organization at risk of losing its bellwether driver and the plethora of knowledge he brought to the program. Hendrick Motorsports hasn't had industry-leading speed since Jeff Gordon retired as a full-time driver in 2015, and the idea those two occurrences correlate should be enough to petrify SHR, which lacks the star power and a Hall of Fame-level mind past Harvick. To wit, SHR's No. 4 entry has produced the fastest car in the series in five of the six seasons since Harvick joined the team and ranked second in the outlier in 2017. It'd be ideal to keep hold of a part of the knowledge base responsible for such an understated yet important accomplishment.\n\nHarvick remaining at SHR means his savvy, regardless of whether he's physically able to implement it or execute on it, stays in house to benefit its next generation, which includes rookie Cole Custer, 22.\n\nHis staying put also represents a hedge on SHR's chances with this year's extraordinarily deep free-agent class, which includes Kyle Larson, Brad Keselowski, Ryan Blaney and Erik Jones, whose names are all likely on a whiteboard somewhere deep in an office on the organization's Kannapolis, N.C., campus. If SHR strikes out on all its top choices, Harvick remains in play and crew chief Rodney Childers goes into career extension mode -- and that means an improved focus on positional defense in vulnerable long-run situations -- until another free agent to its liking surfaces. If SHR does land one of the marquee available drivers, Harvick could prove a sound mind during competition meetings, helping with the new hire's integration. The inverse should suit Harvick as well: He's gone on the record about his delight for heightened feedback from fellow SHR drivers.\n\nRegardless, Harvick's extension puts SHR in a good spot: Even with diminished skills but a keen mind, Harvick could still ensure its equipment remains on elite footing well into the era of the Generation 7 car. Eventually, a competitive environment becomes an attractive free-agent destination; SHR's frugality in recent years belies its spending capability, and while no organization has complete control over the landing spots of every potential domino, it can show well, at the very least, and offer fringe benefits. Access to the Harvick notebook and, if he's willing, his tutelage are unique carrots to dangle.\n\nDiminished productivity is all but an inevitability, but a knowledge base within arm's reach is something on which SHR can continue to build and thrive.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart-Haas_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stewart-Haas Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harvick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Harvick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Custer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Custer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Childers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodney Childers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Blaney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Blaney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Keselowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Keselowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kannapolis,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kannapolis, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kannapolis, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Drivers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/02/08161451/AP_20039687920361.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605736", "eventUri": "eng-9605736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

After weeks of speculation, Stewart-Haas announced on Tuesday in a statement that the team would be closing operations at the end of the year.\n\nWhat might this mean for the Haas Formula 1 team?\n\nFirst, the news out of NASCAR. In a statement co-owners Tony Stewart and Gene Haas announced that at the end of 2024 the team, which was formed back in 2009 and delivered a pair of NASCAR Cup titles -- Stewart's title in 2011 and Kevin Harvick's in 2014 -- would be ceasing operations:\n\n\"We have made the difficult decision to close Stewart-Haas Racing at the conclusion of the 2024 season. It is a decision that did not come easily, nor was it made quickly.\n\n\"Racing is a labor-intensive, humbling sport. It requires unwavering commitment and vast resources, with a 365-day mindset to be better than everyone else. It's part of what makes success so rewarding.\n\n\"But the commitment needed to extract maximum performance while providing sustainability is incredibly demanding, and we've reached a point in our respective personal and business lives where it's time to pass the torch.\n\n\"We're proud of all the wins and championships we've earned since joining together in 2009, but even more special is the culture we built and the friendships we forged as we committed to a common cause -- winning races and collecting trophies.\n\n\"That is the same commitment we made to our personnel, our partners and our fans coming into this year, and that commitment will remain through the season finale at Phoenix.\n\n\"We have tremendous respect and appreciation for all of our employees, and we will work diligently to assist them during this transition to find new opportunities beyond the 2024 race season.\"\n\nStewart-Haas currently has four drivers in the NASCAR Cup series -- Josh Berry, Noah Gragson, Chase Briscoe and Ryan Preece -- as well as Cole Custer and Riley Herbst in NASCAR's Xfinity series.\n\nWith the team's relationship with Ford set to end at the conclusion of the 2024 season, and without a manufacturer lined up for the 2025 campaign, rumors of this move were lingering in the motorsport world for weeks.\n\nNow the question because what impact, if any, could this have on the Haas F1 team?\n\nAt first blush, perhaps no impact at all. Gene Haas has been spending more time with the F1 operation in recent months, and ahead of the 2024 season a leadership change came. Guenther Steiner, the only Team Principal in Haas F1 history, was out, replaced by Ayao Komatsu.\n\nThat move has paid some early dividends, as Haas currently sit seventh in the Constructors' Championship, ahead of their last-place finish a year ago. It also reflects the motive for the change, according to Haas himself. \"It came down to performance,\" Haas told Lawrence Barretto back in January when the move was announced. \"Here we are in our eighth year, over 160 races - we have never had a podium. The last couple of years, we've been 10th or ninth.\n\n\"I'm not sitting here saying it's Guenther's fault, or anything like that, but it just seems like this was an appropriate time to make a change and try a different direction, because it doesn't seem like continuing with what we had is really going to work.\"\n\nDuring that same conversation, Haas reiterated his commitment to the F1 operation.\n\n\"I didn't get into F1 to sell [the team],\" said Haas back in January to F1.com. \"I did it because I wanted to race. Guenther had the same perspective. We're not here to cash out, we want to race and be competitive. If you look at any team, historically, they have had a lot of good years and a lot of bad years.\n\n\"Surviving is one of the characteristics of getting better. As long as you can survive, you always have another year to prove your worthiness. This is a big change. Losing Guenther is going to cause the team to have to focus on other aspects. We will hopefully come out better for it.\"\n\nAnd this answer to Barretto last January certainly looks interesting given the Stewart-Haas news: \"There is a perception we spend a lot less money; we're usually within $10m of the budget limit,\" said Haas. \"I just think we don't do a very good job of spending that money. A lot of teams have had previous investments in their infrastructure, buildings, equipment and personnel. Our model was to outsource a lot of that. We spend a lot of money. We haven't exceeded the cap but we're pretty darn close to it. I just don't think we're doing a very good job of spending it in the most effective way.\n\nThat's one of the reasons we have survived - because we are so conscious of how we spend money,\" added Haas. \"Being efficient at what we do is going to make sure we survive in this series. We're one of the longest surviving teams, everyone else [other new teams] have had the tendency to spend all their money in the first few years and then they go out of business.\n\n\"We survived for eight years, and we're not in a situation where we are going to go out of business. But I certainly want to be able to survive for the next 10 years.\"\n\nSo closing down Stewart-Haas may be another efficient move from the Haas that allows the F1 operation to continue on, and potentially thrive given their relationship with Ferrari.\n\nHowever, this news comes just as discussions around the proposed Andretti-Cadillac team have shifted from that organization becoming the 11th team on the grid, to that team potentially buying an existing team on the grid. Both Red Bull Team Principal Christian Horner, and FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem raised that proposition this past weekend during the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\n\"I have no doubt FOM and Liberty [Media -- F1's ownership group] would love to see other teams as long as they are OEMs [Original Equipment/Car Manufacturers],\" said Ben Sulayem in Monaco to Reuters. \"I would advise them [Andretti-Cadillac] to go and buy another team, not to come as the 11th team.\"\n\nAccording to the FIA President, it comes down to a matter of quality, not quantity.\n\n\"I feel that some teams need to be refreshed. What is better? To have 11 teams as a number or 10 and they are strong? I still believe we should have more teams but not any teams. The right teams,\" added Ben Sulayem.\n\n\"It's not about the number, it's about the quality.\"\n\nHorner mirrored that sentiment ahead of the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\n\"I think Andretti is a great racing heritage,\" said Horner to assembled media in Monaco. \"Mario is a legend of the sport and of course, [they are partnered with] Cadillac, the huge automotive manufacturer from the US.\n\n\"I think Formula 1 have said in 2028, if they were to come with their own engine, they would obviously review it but I think in addition to that, I think that if Andretti were to want to come, a little like Audi acquired Sauber, I think to protect the current franchises' stability that we have in the sport, then, obviously, their best route to the goal is to acquire one of the existing teams.\"\n\nPerhaps the Stewart-Haas news has no impact at all on the F1 operation, and maybe even sees the team take another step forward due to the efficiency argument advanced by Haas last January.\n\nOr, perhaps it does have an impact, given the latest twist in the ongoing Andretti-Cadillac saga.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors":

Upon Custer slowing down, Dillon then had to slow which allowed Briscoe to pass both drivers. NASCAR said Sunday after the race that the incident was under review and video, data and radio transmissions were to be analyzed to determine whether Custer had committed a rules violation.\n\nGreg Zipadelli, chief competition officer of Stewart-Haas, issued a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"Stewart-Haas Racing denies any wrongdoing and will vigorously defend any personnel against these allegations in its appeal with NASCAR,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Scott Miller, NASCAR senior vice president of competition, said Shiplett was heard telling Custer, \"I think you got a flat (tire). Check up, check up,\" even though Shiplett could not see Custer's car.\n\n\"Obviously, pretty telling as to what went on there,\" Miller said. \"That, coupled with the data in the video and all the rest of the things that we looked into -- in-car videos and whatnot -- nothing contradicted the fact that was done deliberately by those individuals. So we were certainly forced to react.\n\n\"We can't have teams manipulating the finishing order.\"\n\nBriscoe was one of eight drivers who advanced out of the second playoff round Sunday; Kyle Larson, Daniel Suarez, Austin Cindric and Alex Bowman were the four drivers eliminated. Briscoe advanced to Round 3 by two points over Larson, the defending Cup champion.\n\nNo penalties were issued to Briscoe or his No. 14 SHR team. NASCAR determined Briscoe was already in position to transfer to the next round (via a tiebreaker) before Custer slowed and there were no radio transmissions from the team to Briscoe informing that Custer intended to run interference on his behalf.\n\nHad the evidence proved that Briscoe had knowledge of Custer's actions or had Briscoe moved into a transfer spot, Miller said NASCAR would've issued harsher penalties -- including the possible removal of Briscoe from the playoffs. In 2013, NASCAR removed Martin Truex Jr. from the playoffs after it was found that Michael Waltrip had conspired to manipulate the finish of the regular-season finale by directing Clint Bowyer to intentionally spinout to assist MWR teammate Truex in qualifying for the playoffs.\n\n\"(Briscoe) qualified for the Round of 8 without this, but had it not been the case and (Briscoe) would have gotten into the (next round) we would have had to react in an even stronger fashion,\" Miller said.\n\nA driver obstructing competitors to assist a teammate is not uncommon in NASCAR, with several recent examples -- including during the playoffs. Most notably, an incident between Hendrick Motorsports' Chase Elliott and SHR's Kevin Harvick that saw Elliott suffer a flat tire after contact with Harvick as they fought for position during a 2021 playoff race at Bristol Motor Speedway. After pitting for fresh tires, Elliott retaliated by returning to the track and deliberately slowing in front of Harvick, who was leading. Elliott's actions allowed Hendrick teammate Larson to pass Harvick for the lead and go on for the win.\n\nNASCAR did not penalize Elliott for impeding Harvick. Nor did the league penalize Chip Ganassi Racing's Ross Chastain when he intentionally blocked leader Kyle Busch so that CGR teammate Kurt Busch could pass his younger brother for the lead during the closing laps of a 2021 regular season race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_bianchi@nytimes.com", "name": "Jordan Bianchi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart-Haas_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stewart-Haas Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Dillon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Austin Dillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shiplett", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Shiplett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Briscoe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Briscoe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Zipadelli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Zipadelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Custer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Custer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_stop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pit stop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Cindric", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin Cindric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Truex_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Truex Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Waltrip", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Waltrip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Bowyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clint Bowyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Waltrip_Racing", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Waltrip Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Ganassi_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chip Ganassi Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Chastain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ross Chastain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bristol Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Harvick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Harvick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Busch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Busch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Busch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Busch"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 45}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2022/10/11182206/USATSI_19206135-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9605736", "eventUri": "eng-9605736", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

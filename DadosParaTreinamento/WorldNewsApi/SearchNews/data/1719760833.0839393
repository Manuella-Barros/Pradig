The limited edition tasty bubblegum and white chocolate treat by Equi\u2019s Ice Cream went on sale yesterday, Tuesday, May 28, at selected shops across Scotland. With the first 30 customers at each shop who sing a few lines from their favourite Taylor track receiving a free one scoop cone or tub. \u2018Swifties\u2019 loved the new ice cream, which is served with extra sparkle with a spray of edible glitter in true Tay Tay style, with one saying it was \u201cso nice\u201d and \u201cdelicious\u201d. One excited fan described it as \u201cTaylor Swift in a cone\u201d, while another Swiftie said it is \u201cperfectly sweet\u201d. The new flavour was developed by David Equi, owner of Equi\u2019s, and his daughter Alex, Equi\u2019s Brand Manager, who also happens to be a huge Taylor fan. You can try out a Swiftie Swirl at Gladstone\u2019s Land at the top of the High Street, or at Sofi\u2019s Gelato at the Grassmarket and Cream In My Cone at the Gyle Shopping Centre.", "summary": "<p>Taylor Swift fever grips Edinburgh ahead of record-breaking Murrayfield concerts</p>", "url": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/people/watch-edinburgh-taylor-swift-fans-try-out-the-new-swiftie-swirl-ice-cream-for-free-by-singing-her-songs-4645846", "image": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2024/05/29/9/33/_SH19394.jpg.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:11:08", "author": "Kevin Quinn", "authors": ["Kevin Quinn"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.715}

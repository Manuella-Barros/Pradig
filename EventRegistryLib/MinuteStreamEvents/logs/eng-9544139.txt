Transit orders 66 electric buses from Canadian suppliers", "body": "The buses will be arriving gradually starting early next year and continuing until mid-2026\n\nB.C. Transit says it has ordered 66 electric buses from two Canadian-based suppliers after a previous supplier from California filed for bankruptcy.\n\nOn Monday, B.C. Transit said it has requested the buses from two pre-qualified suppliers -- Nova Bus, a Quebec-based bus manufacturer, and New Flyer, a Winnipeg-based manufacturer.\n\nHalf of that order is for 40-foot electric buses from Nova Bus.\n\nCompany spokesperson Christos Kritsidimas said the LFSe+ model that B.C. Transit is purchasing is already in use in Vancouver, Halifax and Quebec City.\n\nAccording to a specification sheet from the company, the LFSe+ holds up to 68 passengers and has a seating capacity of 41.\n\nThe bus, which can store up to 564 kWh of onboard energy, takes less than 3.5 hours to fully charge at a depot.\n\nThe deal for the 33-bus purchase from B.C. Transit was inked on Monday morning, Kritsidimas said, adding that the first buses could be delivered as soon as next year.\n\nWhile B.C. Transit has not confirmed how the buses will be allocated across the province, the transit agency is in the process of installing about 134 electric bus charging points in the next two years in nine B.C. communities, including Victoria and Nanaimo.\n\nThe buses will be arriving gradually starting early next year and continuing until mid-2026, it said in a statement.\n\nKritsidimas, who was taking a technical tour on a bus in Halifax when reached on Monday, said he did not have the financial details of the purchase on hand.\n\nThe Times Colonist has reached out to B.C. Transit and New Flyer for more information about the orders.\n\nB.C. Transit's previous 10-bus $20-million contract with Proterra, a California-based bus manufacturer, fell through after the company applied for bankruptcy.\n\nB.C. Transit could not reach an agreement with North Carolina-based Phoenix Motors, which had acquired Proterra after it declared bankruptcy and has been looking for other partners to supply its electric buses.\n\nIt issued a request last month for companies to prequalify to supply 40-foot-long heavy-duty electric transit buses.\n\nB.C. Transit said Monday that more procurement is on the way.\n\nThe transit agency said last month that funding is now in place for it to purchase 141 battery-electric buses for its fleet province-wide, up from the 115 initially promised in July 2023.\n\nFunding totaling $395.5 million for buses and infrastructure was announced in July 2023.\n\nThe Crown corporation, which owns a fleet of 1,106 buses of varying types, is aiming to have a fully electric fleet by 2040.\n\n[email protected]", "source": {"uri": "timescolonist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Times Colonist"}, "authors": [],

State Sen. George Borrello, R-Sunset Bay, proposed replacing it with a feasibility study. He called it a \"commonsense step\" that should be taken before any large-scale mandate.\n\nThe directive will help the state meet goals in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act to drastically reduce greenhouse gases, its advocates say, and be healthier for students.\n\nEducators don't quibble with transporting students in buses that don't spew harmful tailpipe emissions.\n\nDiesel buses emit toxic fumes linked to asthma and cancer. The American Lung Association in New York State said the transition to zero-emission vehicles in New York would generate $68.2 billion in public health benefits and result in up to 6,200 avoided deaths and 159,000 avoided asthma attacks.\n\nElectric buses cost more\n\nThe main concern with the mandate, included in the 2022-23 state budget, is economic. Electric buses cost two to three times more than diesel- or gasoline-powered buses.\n\nA large diesel school bus runs about $165,000, while a comparable electric vehicle could cost $400,000 to $460,000, Graham said. He estimated full replacement of Grand Island's fleet at $25 million.\n\n\"Unless you are blessed to have a tremendous amount of grant money, the taxpayers locally will have to approve a purchase like that,\" he said. \"I think that is a lot to ask the community.\"\n\nVoters in many districts will be asked later this month to approve propositions to purchase buses. In most years, bus purchases are routinely approved, but if they carry a big price tag with higher taxes, residents could turn them down.\n\nThere is some help for districts, however: $500 million was set aside in the 2022 Environmental Bond Act to help fund the buses and new infrastructure, such as charging stations.\n\nThe federal Environmental Protection Agency also has a Clean School Bus Program Grant competition.\n\nNew York State Energy Research and Development Authority developed an electric school bus roadmap for school districts. It suggests a \"gradual approach for school districts at first, starting with the electrification of more feasible bus routes and leveraging overnight charging opportunities, then ramping up their efforts once school buses reach cost parity and more charging infrastructure is established.\"\n\nBarker obtained a grant from the EPA for its contractor, Student Transportation of America, to purchase the buses and install charging stations at the bus garage.\n\nSuperintendent Jacob L. Reimer said the nine in-district bus runs will use the electric vehicles. The routes are 60 miles to 80 miles long, he said, while the battery charge is expected be good for 110 miles per charge. For longer out-of-district trips, such as taking students to sporting events, he said diesel buses will be used.\n\nThe Lake Shore experience\n\nEileen Hahn started driving Lake Shore Central buses this school year. She said the electric buses, which look like the diesel ones from the outside, have better pickup than diesel coaches, some of the buttons are different, and the buses are quieter.\n\n\"It's extremely quiet, which I think also helps the children to be quiet because they can talk, rather than yell to each other,\" she said.\n\nSuperintendents also wonder if the charge is affected by cold weather. There are concerns about the weight of the buses impacting roads and bridges.\n\nSome of the questions can be answered by Perry Oddi at Lake Shore in Evans, who has fielded calls from a number of superintendents and heads of transportation during the past two years.\n\nLake Shore bought its first electric school bus in 2022.\n\n\"It's been performing very well for us,\" said Oddi, the transportation supervisor. \"It is very reliable and it's consistent.\"\n\nThe district got its second electric battery-operated bus in 2023.\n\n\"That vehicle has outperformed our expectations,\" he said.\n\nThe district expected the bus to travel 125 miles before needing a charge, and it goes farther than that. On the coldest day during the winter, 9 degrees, there was a drop in efficiency of less than 3%, Oddi said.\n\nElectricity is about two-thirds the cost of fuel for a diesel vehicle and maintenance is about one-third the cost, Oddi said.\n\nThe frame and suspension are the same, but electric buses have two large battery packs, instead of a fuel tank and engine. The bus is about 1,250 pounds heavier than the traditional diesel, which weighs 19,500 pounds, Oddi said.\n\nDistrict staff has educated parents and children on the new buses, and invited first responders from the 13 towns in Erie, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua counties where electric buses transport children for training, about how to respond to an emergency with an electric bus.\n\nMany districts are doing studies on the costs and electrical availability. Lake Shore installed one transformer for its two charging stations. The district won a $7.9 million grant to acquire 20 more electric buses, and will install three additional transformers, Oddi said.\n\n\"Having the actual capacity to provide electricity to charge is one of the bigger hurdles out there that is quite costly,\" said Conrad, the assemblyman.\n\nCharging stations could cost up to $100,000 for a fast charge and from $5,000 to $15,000 for a slower charge.\n\n\"2027 is right around the corner,\" he said. \"It's going to come here faster than we think.\"\n\n0 Comments Tags Motor Vehicles Transportation The Economy Roads And Traffic Trade Politics Industry School Systems Education Institutions Electricity Finance Electrotechnics Ecology Medicine Job Market Want to see more like this?\n\nGet our local education coverage delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Transit said it has requested the buses from two pre-qualified suppliers -- Nova Bus, a Quebec-based bus manufacturer, and New Flyer, a Winnipeg-based manufacturer.\n\nHalf of that order is for 40-foot electric buses from Nova Bus.\n\nCompany spokesperson Christos Kritsidimas said the LFSe+ model that B.C. Transit is purchasing is already in use in Vancouver, Halifax and Quebec City.\n\nAccording to a specification sheet from the company, the LFSe+ holds up to 68 passengers and has a seating capacity of 41.\n\nThe bus, which can store up to 564 kWh of onboard energy, takes less than 3.5 hours to fully charge at a depot.\n\nThe deal for the 33-bus purchase from B.C. Transit was inked on Monday morning, Kritsidimas said, adding that the first buses could be delivered as soon as next year.\n\nWhile B.C. Transit has not confirmed how the buses will be allocated across the province, the transit agency is in the process of installing about 134 electric bus charging points in the next two years in nine B.C. communities, including Victoria and Nanaimo.\n\nThe buses will be arriving gradually starting early next year and continuing until mid-2026, it said in a statement.\n\nKritsidimas, who was taking a technical tour on a bus in Halifax when reached on Monday, said he did not have the financial details of the purchase on hand.\n\nThe Times Colonist has reached out to B.C.

Transit's previous 10-bus $20-million contract with Proterra, a California-based bus manufacturer, fell through after the company applied for bankruptcy.\n\nB.C. Transit could not reach an agreement with North Carolina-based Phoenix Motors, which had acquired Proterra after it declared bankruptcy and has been looking for other partners to supply its electric buses.\n\nIt issued a request last month for companies to prequalify to supply 40-foot-long heavy-duty electric transit buses.\n\nB.C. Transit said Monday that more procurement is on the way.\n\nThe transit agency said last month that funding is now in place for it to purchase 141 battery-electric buses for its fleet province-wide, up from the 115 initially promised in July 2023.\n\nFunding totaling $395.5 million for buses and infrastructure was announced in July 2023.\n\nThe Crown corporation, which owns a fleet of 1,106 buses

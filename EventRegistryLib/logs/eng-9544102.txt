Shortly after departure, the ship lost propulsion and allided with the Scott Key Bridge, which subsequently collapsed. The ship's crew were reported safe, but eight road workers were working on the bridge when it collapsed. Two were rescued from the water, the bodies of two more were recovered soon after. A third body was recovered on 5 April, a fourth on 14 April and a fifth on 1 May. One remains missing and is presumed dead.\n\nPicture (top): An aerial image of the Unified Command response operations in Baltimore, Maryland on 22 April (US Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Alejandro Rivera).", "source": {"uri": "swzmaritime.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "SWZ|Maritime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mariska_buitendijk@swzmaritime.nl", "name": "Mariska Buitendijk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Bridge_(Washington,_D.C.)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Key Bridge (Washington, D.C.)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marine salvage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_and_arrow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bow and arrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O'Connell_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David O'Connell (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(hull)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (hull)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Baltimore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port of Baltimore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_McHenry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort McHenry"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Structural Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Trick_Capturing", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Trick Capturing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Bridges_and_Tunnels", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Bridges and Tunnels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Toll_and_Automated", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Toll and Automated", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://swzmaritime.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Key-Bridge-on-deck-of-the-container-ship-Dali-by-US-Coast-Guard.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544102", "eventUri": "eng-9544102", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-26", "textStart": 149, "textEnd": 157, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1396, "textEnd": 1404}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-05", "textStart": 2127, "textEnd": 2134}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-14", "textStart": 2148, "textEnd": 2156}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 2172, "textEnd": 2177}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 2322, "textEnd": 2330}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

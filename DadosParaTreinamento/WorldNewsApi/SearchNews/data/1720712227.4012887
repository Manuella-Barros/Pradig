Thakur congratulated Modi and his \u201cteam of ministers\u201d and said all those who have been picked for ministerial positions in the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government are \u201cvery competent\u201d. They will make \u201cevery possible effort\u201d to take the country on the path of progress, the outgoing information and broadcasting minister said. In the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections, Thakur was reelected to the Lower House of Parliament from Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh. \u201cI am a party worker first. The people of Hamirpur in Himachal Pradesh have elected me to the Lok Sabha for the fifth consecutive time. Being elected to the Lok Sabha for the fifth time is itself a great honour,\u201d he told reporters here when asked if he would be getting some key responsibility in Himachal Pradesh as he is not being inducted into Modi\u2019s new council of ministers. Thakur said that \u201cthe BJP has given me the opportunity to contest the Lok Sabha polls five times. There cannot be a bigger opportunity than this for me\u201d. \u201cI worked as a party worker in the past and would continue to work as a party worker in the future. Our entire effort is to take India on the path of progress. All of us will walk together because India is important, the Modi government is important and the country\u2019s progress is important,\u201d he said. Thakur said he was confident that under the leadership of Prime Minister-designate Modi, the country will scale new heights and become the third largest economy and a developed country.

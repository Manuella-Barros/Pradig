Jake Porter, the dad of the late model who was Combs' former partner, told Rolling Stone on Friday, June 7, that he was \"disgusted\" by the recently released footage of the 54-year-old music mogul grabbing, shoving and kicking Cassie during a 2016 altercation. \u201cYou can say I was disgusted with the video, and I wouldn\u2019t treat my enemy like that,\u201d Jake, 78, told the outlet. \"It was despicable. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was in Vietnam, and I wouldn\u2019t do that to my enemy.\u201d A rep for Combs did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment on Sunday, June 9. Jake also told Rolling Stone that though he never saw Combs physically abuse his late daughter, he said, \u201cIt made me wonder.\u201d Kim dated Combs on and off from 1994 until 2007, before she died of lobar pneumonia in 2018. The two welcomed son Christian Combs in 1998, and twin daughters D'Lila Star Combs and Jessie James Combs in 2006. Kim's father added that the \u201chorrible\u201d video has now given him a \u201cdifferent outlook\u201d on his daughter's former partner. \u201cI didn\u2019t know he could stoop that low,\u201d Jake said. \u201cI imagine it surprised a lot of people. I wouldn\u2019t even do a dog like that. My heart goes out to Cassie.\u201d Jake also shared that Kim loved Combs, but \u201cjust couldn\u2019t live with\u201d him in the same home. \u201cI think he was a very jealous person,\u201d Jake said. \u201cThey both loved each other. Kim\u2019s love was legitimate. Puffy\u2019s love, I don\u2019t know what he calls love, you know what I mean? I really don\u2019t think he has any idea what love is.\u201d For Jake, his \u201cconcern is the children,\" he told Rolling Stone. After the release of the 2016 hotel surveillance footage of Combs attacking Cassie, the Bad Boy Records founder issued an apology on Instagram, sharing that he was \"disgusted\" by his actions. Jake's comments come after Howard University rescinded Combs' honorary degree earlier this month. The university noted via a statement on its website that its Board of Trustees \"voted unanimously today to accept the return by Mr. Sean Combs of the honorary degree conferred upon him in 2014.\" The decision, the school wrote, \"revokes all honors and privileges associated with the degree.\" \"Mr. Combs\u2019 behavior as captured in a recently released video is so fundamentally incompatible with Howard University\u2019s core values and beliefs that he is deemed no longer worthy to hold the institution\u2019s highest honor,\" the school added. \"The University is unwavering in its opposition to all acts of interpersonal violence.\" If you are experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, or go to thehotline.org.

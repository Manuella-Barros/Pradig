From a high of Rs 36,493 crore revenue in 2023-24, the state is all set to uncork another record in revenues in the 2024-25 financial year. Year on year, the revenue through liquor sales and monthly licence fee collected from liquor dealers seems to move northwards. In 2022-23, the state govt had earned Rs 34,145 crore revenue. 111352947 As per the 2011 census, southern states like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have higher population and low alcohol sales, whereas Telangana\u2019s population is less compared to these states but has higher alcohol sales. \u201cAlcohol is consumed more here than other southern states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. This means Telangana tops in the consumption of liquor in the south. Due to this, the state excise department also gets huge revenues,\u201d an industry source said. Amid the serious economic crunch, excise officials said the department was able to bring in money into the depleting coffers of the state thanks to tipplers\u2019 generous buying. June has been a heavy income-generating month in the last two-three years with earnings swelling to Rs 2,800 crore to Rs 3,000 crore in just one month. But the highest income generation of Rs 4,297 crore was recorded in Dec 2023, an official said.Sources said tenders will be issued soon to allow liquor companies to offer their pricing for ensuring supplies. If the tender is floated, it will be only second such instance after the state\u2019s formation in 2014. Tenders are primarily intended for companies interested in joining the Telangana State Beverages Corporation Ltd\u2019s supply list. \u201cRegardless of whether the companies will take part in the tender process, they can register themselves with TSBCL for supply of liquor, but they will only have to supply at the rate that was accepted and approved through the tendering process. The govt will adjust the tariffs for consumers at any moment even after the rates are approved,\u201d a source said. Govt sources said a revision of pricing is being contemplated to rationalise it with that of neighbouring states. \u201cThis new pricing structure will also help buoy our finances. We are also exploring other ways to bring in more revenues,\u201d a source said. Officials said Karnataka govt, for instance, has set an ambitious revenue target of Rs 38,525 crore for 2024-25 financial year for its excise department. \u201cWe have a higher target to achieve. Telangana has been seeing an exponential rise in excise revenue,\u201d a senior official said.", "summary": "Telangana's excise revenue soars, with plans for pricing revision to meet Karnataka's target.

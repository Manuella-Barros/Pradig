A departure for the Gunners striker this summer is a real possibility with the French club showing a keen interest in acquiring his services.\n\nThe 25-year-old featured significantly in the first half of the last campaign, in the absence of key players due to injury, but he then did not make one Premier League start in 2024. As has been showcased, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus are undoubtedly above him in the pecking order and that certainly makes an exit being sealed more likely.\n\nBoth parties appear open to parting ways and it looks as though Marseille are the club hoping to benefit. Roberto De Zerbi's side have already agreed personal terms with Nketiah, however football.london understands the clubs remain far apart on their valuation and no deal is expected to take place at the current level of proposals.\n\nNonetheless, talks are expected to continue with the latest bid from Marseille at the value of \u00a323.1million (\u20ac27m) which is closer to the \u00a330million Arsenal want. However, it does not appear as though Nketiah is their priority with a deal to sign Youssoufa Moukoko on a season-long from Borussia Dortmund very close to being finalised.\n\nThere is no guarantee Marseille come back in with an improved bid for Nketiah, however Arsenal are clearly intent on removing the stigma they cannot achieve fair value for their assets. With that in mind, the Hale End graduate could yet remain in north London and a social media post has hinted at his true transfer feelings.\n\nOn Instagram, he reposted Arsenal's tour recap post which was full of the best images from their pre-season camp in the United States. The specific image shared by Nketiah showed him lining up for the Gunners wearing the captain's armband, which would have undoubtedly been a proud moment.\n\nREAD MORE: Merino signs, striker snubbed and Nketiah sold - Predicting Arsenal end of summer transfer window\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal transfer news LIVE \u00a315.4m deal agreed amid Dominic Solanke plan as Merino decision imminent\n\nThough he wants more minutes, it is very likely that Nketiah would prefer those to come representing his boyhood club.

The Gunners have softened their stance after Nketiah agreed personal terms with the Ligue 1 giants.\n\nMikel Arteta is determined to take Arsenal to Premier League glory in the 2024-25 season. According to the manager, the squad needs reinforcements to finish ahead of Manchester City and Liverpool in the title race. One of the key areas that needs attention is the attack.\n\nIn the 2023-24 Premier League season, Arsenal finished two points behind Manchester City in the title race. Had the North Londoners been a tad more clinical in a game or two, they would have beaten Pep Guardiola and Co. to the punch. Both of their designated strikers, Gabriel Jesus and Eddie Nketiah, failed to attain consistency. While Jesus scored four goals and provided five assists in 27 appearances, Nketiah netted five times and claimed two assists in 27 games.\n\nAccording to reports, Arsenal are interested in signing a striker this summer. But before bringing a fresh face, they must get rid of one of the two out-and-out center-forwards in their ranks. By the looks of it, Nketiah could be the one to depart this summer, possibly to Marseille.\n\nArsenal initially rejected Marseille's \u20ac27 million ($29.53 million) offer for Nketiah, holding out hope for a \u20ac35 million ($38.28 million) payout. However, with the French side not showing much eagerness, Arteta's team has agreed to re-negotiate payment terms.\n\nIn his Daily Briefing column, Romano revealed:\n\n\"A lot continues to be written about the Eddie Nketiah and Marseille situation, so I thought I'd once again clarify my understanding of this saga here.\n\n\"From what I know, Arsenal are open to re-discussing terms with Marseille after initially rejecting a \u20ac27m bid and asking for \u20ac35m, plus a sell-on clause. Now they can be open to discuss and negotiate different structure.\"\n\nHe concluded by adding:\n\n\"The precise asking price is not something clear yet but the two clubs have been in touch again and Arsenal can be open to discuss terms with OM. Nketiah had already agreed on personal terms, so no issue there, and it's now on the clubs to reach an agreement.\"\n\nNketiah, 25, has played 168 games for Arsenal over the years, scoring 38 times and providing seven assists.

The player himself has reportedly agreed to a five-year contract with the French club, eager to play under De Zerbi's leadership.\n\nHowever, the financial gap between the two clubs is proving to be a major stumbling block.\n\nArsenal's demands have been labelled \"excessive\" by several sources. While Nketiah has shown promise with six goals and three assists in the 2023-2024 season, his role as a substitute at Arsenal and his current contract running until June 2027 have led many to question the validity of Arsenal's asking price.\n\nIn response to the stalled negotiations, OM has quickly shifted its focus to Borussia Dortmund's Youssoufa Moukoko. The 19-year-old German international, also seeking more playing time, has reportedly reached a contractual agreement with OM and is keen to join the Ligue 1 side. Negotiations for a loan with an option to buy are currently underway.\n\nArsenal's stance on Nketiah's transfer reflects their confidence in the player's potential and their desire to maximise their return on investment and these reports smack of the media helping Marseille drive Nketiah's price down. However, if Arsenal are unwilling to compromise on their financial demands, they risk losing out on a potential deal altogether. With the transfer window closing in a few weeks, both clubs will need to act decisively if they want to secure their respective targets.\n\nFor Arsenal, the potential sale of Nketiah could provide additional funds for further reinforcements. However, if they fail to reach an agreement with OM, they may have to explore alternative options to offload the striker or risk keeping a potentially unhappy player on their books.", "source": {"uri": "dailycannon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Cannon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lee_hurley@dailycannon.com", "name": "Lee Hurley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympique_de_Marseille", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympique de Marseille"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Nketiah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Nketiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_De_Zerbi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roberto De Zerbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youssoufa_Moukoko", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Youssoufa Moukoko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger_Management", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Anger Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://dailycannon.com/static/uploads/2023/10/arsenal-fc-v-sheffield-united-premier-league-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791368", "eventUri": "eng-9791368", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

However, it is the forward line in particular which has been of increased focus for supporters in the sense of a real desperation to see the club sign a top striker.\n\nDespite this desire, this looks to be the area where investment looks the least likely at this stage. Central midfield is understood by football.london to be the priority and there is an interest in Real Sociedad's Mikel Merino.\n\nYet the knowledge of a push to sign a striker has not been met with a predominance of identifiable targets. Therefore, there is a possibility that a striker might not be signed this summer and fans will have to make their peace with that.\n\nEddie Nketiah is of course tied into this too as negotiations with Marseille have so far been unable to find an agreement. The player is open to the move, however sporting director Edu Gaspar is rightfully holding out for the figure the club believe to be the player's valuation.\n\nShould Nketiah leave, that might have an impact on the club's determination to add a striker but it is by no means a guarantee. Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus and Leandro Trossard are all existing options for the club in the role and there is a greater need on the wing.\n\nBukayo Saka is the only natural left-footed right winger in the squad. Fabio Vieira has been shoehorned into the role in pre-season, Reiss Nelson has been used there and youngster Ethan Nwaneri given a chance too despite all their natural roles lying elsewhere.\n\nREAD MORE: Merino signs, striker snubbed and Nketiah sold - Predicting Arsenal end of summer transfer window\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal risk Eddie Nketiah transfer collapse but Edu has reason to stand firm in Marseille talks\n\nTherefore, if Arsenal do move for a forward it should arguably be for a winger and not a striker. This is further justified by the lack of obvious candidates for the role, with the \u00a384million it would take to land Viktor Gyokeres coming with a serious gamble after one truly top season for the mid-twenties Swede.\n\nMeanwhile, Victor Osimhen is another very expensive option who endured a regression last season from his 31-goal campaign that helped Napoli win the league. Ivan Toney failed to return to action from his ban with form that has convinced any club to make a meaningful proposal so far this summer.\n\nSo what if Arsenal don't sign a striker this window? The short answer is, not much.\n\nThe longer answer would point to the record-breaking goalscoring season the club had as they just missed out on the title despite their eventual established centre-forward Havertz playing two-thirds of the campaign in midfield.\n\nHe still managed 13 goals in the league, with just one being a penalty. His 18 games at centre-forward last season delivered 15 goal contributions (eight goals and seven assists).\n\nSigning a striker does not suddenly guarantee that Arsenal win the title, nor does it even guarantee an increase in the amount of goals scored. The club do not make signings for the sake of it and should they deem it better to wait till an upcoming window to assess the market for better options over investing on a player who they have doubts over then they have, with their track record, earned that faith.", "source": {"uri": "football.london", "dataType": "news", "title": "footballlondon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_canton@football.london", "name": "Tom Canton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Nketiah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Nketiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Merino", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Merino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edu_(footballer,_born_1978)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edu (footballer, born 1978)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Sociedad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Sociedad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympique_de_Marseille", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympique de Marseille"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reiss_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reiss Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Havertz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kai Havertz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leandro_Trossard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leandro Trossard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Vieira", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Vieira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

The Gunners have already brought in Riccardo Calafiori as their marquee arrival while Emile Smith Rowe is the big departure from Emirates Stadium.\n\nCalafiori has been joined by David Raya and Tommy Setford as permanent transfers in with Albert Sambi Lokonga and Nuno Tavares as two to exit north London alongside Smith Rowe. Reiss Nelson, Aaron Ramsdale and Eddie Nketiah could all leave with a huge update emerging on the latter.\n\nAs for more potential arrivals, Real Sociedad star Mikel Merino looks to be the most likely addition with midfield identified as a position the club want to strengthen in. Youssouf Fofana and Martin Zubimendi have also been linked but both of those options are now being targeted by other Premier League clubs.\n\nLiverpool are now in pole position to acquire the services of Zubimendi and that could have a major impact on the future of his teammate Merino. With that being said, football.london has taken a look at the latest Arsenal transfer rumours, which includes a fresh perspective.\n\nZubimendi to Liverpool impact\n\nAccording to The Athletic, Sociedad are of the expectation that Zubimendi will accept a transfer to Liverpool. It it noted, though, that a deal is not close to completion with the Premier League club still needing to pay his \u00a351.7million (\u20ac60m) release clause in full.\n\nIf the Spanish club do lose Zubimendi, it is perhaps more unlikely they will also sanction an exit for Merino, which would significantly derail Arsenal's midfield plans.\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal transfer news LIVE - Mikel Merino blow, Eddie Nketiah stance, Gabriel Jesus message\n\nREAD MORE: What Thomas Partey did to Granit Xhaka as Arsenal humble Bayer Leverkusen in high-scoring clash\n\nfootball.london says: \"The Gunners have been chasing Merino for the last few weeks with contact made on the side of the player. Any deal being agreed between the two parties seems some way off and it could stay that way if Liverpool sign Zubimendi.\n\n\"Being brutally honest, if Arsenal miss out on another midfield target because of their hesitance, it could come back to bite Arteta significantly. Jorginho and Thomas Partey are both very good defensive midfielders but their durability over a lengthy period is questionable.\n\n\"Therefore, signing a new midfield is important and it is undoubtedly critical that Arsenal respond to Liverpool's Zubimendi decision with a renewed push for Merino.\"\n\nNketiah stance change\n\nArsenal have softened their Eddie Nketiah transfer stance amid interest from Marseille, as per French outlet Foot Mercato.\n\nThey write that the Gunners are now showing themselves to be 'more reasonable' surrounding Nketiah, though Marseille are looking at alternatives having seen two bids rejected. RC Lens striker Elye Wahi has since emerged as a target of the French club.\n\nfootball.london says: \"Arsenal have every right to demand what they feel is an acceptable price for Nketiah, however the risk that interested parties just won't meet that was always present. Marseille are yet to come close and other transfer decisions suggest they are looking elsewhere.\n\n\"Perhaps in an attempt to ensure a fair fee is received for Nketiah, Arsenal look to be open to accepting lower offers. If anywhere between \u00a325million to \u00a330million can be obtained upfront for Nketiah, that will likely be considered a good deal.\n\n\"Edu has proven to be very clever in negotiations recently but amid the impending threat of Marseille cooling their interest, it is no surprise the club's selling stance has changed.\"\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

They claim that Mikel Arteta is perfectly content with keeping the Hale End star, and he wants to make it clear that he never had any intention of forcing him out of the club. So, do you think Mikel Arteta is really keen on keeping Nketiah?\n\nWith Gabriel Martinelli, Kai Havertz, Bukayo Saka, Leandro Trossard, and Gabriel Jesus, I think the Gunners have a solid attack. Even if they sell and don't replace Nketiah, don't be worried; they'll still have an attack that opponents would dread, even Nketiah can score sometimes when we are in need of throwing every attacker on the pitch.\n\nNketiah is still moving on, which is the right decision for him. He's got 15 goals and 2 assists in 34 starts for Arsenal; he's not that prolific, so they should definitely consider letting him go. At 25 years old, the Englishman needs to play regularly if he wants to have a meaningful career, but otherwise we still managed to score 90 goals last season, and of course the same goes for Reiss Nelson, if no big enough offers arrive.\n\nArsenal's statement about being willing to retain him could simply be a tactic to encourage potential buyers, such as Marseille, to meet their desired price. Arteta discusses the fine margins that can make all the difference at the highest level of competition. Maybe if Arsenal finds a better striker to replace Eddie, it could be the fine edge they need to win the league, or maybe just thinks Calafiori and Merino reinforcing the left flank, we will have already increased those 'fine margins'.\n\nThere doesn't even seem to be any serious rumours about Aaron Ramsdale moving on, and Zinchenko made a statement a couple of days that seemed to make it clear that he's staying, so could Arsenal have in fact finished their involvement in this transfer window after Merino, and we will try and topple City by just keeping this squad intact?\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.

Marseille, who have shown the most interest in him, have had three bids rejected, the third for roughly \u00a323 million. Interestingly, some Gooners have begun to criticise Arsenal's decision not to simply accept the offers Marseille has made, despite the club's desire to let Nketiah go and sell him (remove his \u00a3100k a week wage from their wage bill), to boost our transfer kitty and make room for another striker.\n\nYou cannot express dissatisfaction over Arsenal's poor sales and then lose your cool when bidders' offers fall short of their asking price. We are in the era of PSR, and every million counts. Clubs must now be tough with their deals, or they risk losing points in the future, like Nottingham Forest and Everton did last season. We are supporters; let's support the team while allowing the club's decision-makers to make the proper and tricky decisions.\n\nFor new signings, the days of \"simply paying the money\" and \"just accepting the fee\" for sales are over. If we can sell Emile Smith Rowe for \u00a334 million, we can certainly sell Nketiah for \u00a330 million. Marseille may be the team that has stepped forward for him, but there's every likelihood a PL side may step up interest, and it looks like it will depend on who fulfils Arsenal's asking price.\n\nYou agree not to give any personal abuse to other Arsenal fans.

And so clearly are the Mirror, who are claiming as news that Arsenal have sold Emile Smith Rowe and loaned out Nuno Tavares and Albert Sambi Lokonga but somehow contrived to lose no more members of their first-team squad despite there being less than three weeks before the end of the transfer window.\n\nArsenal have offloaded just three of their seven transfer-listed players as Mikel Arteta signals for a summer exodus.\n\nHow has he 'signalled' for a summer exodus? As far as we know he has said f*** all about a summer exodus. What would the 'signal' be? A sort of push-wave with both hands?\n\nIt was reported that several players had been deemed surplus to requirements at the Emirates, namely Emile Smith Rowe, Nuno Tavares, and Albert Sambi Lokonga - who have already left the club.\n\nHowever, four more players, including Aaron Ramsdale, Eddie Nketiah, Kieran Tierney, and Reiss Nelson, are yet to depart this summer despite the Gunners making it clear they would consider bids to sell them.\n\nCouple of things here:\n\na) It's August 6. And Arsenal's international stars are just returning to training. If Arsenal had sold all those players already, they would have had 10 first-team players on the plane for their pre-season tour of the United States.\n\nb) The Gunners did not 'make it clear they would consider bids to sell them'; you reported that they did.\n\nNow Arsenal might well want to sell Aaron Ramsdale, Eddie Nketiah, Kieran Tierney and Reiss Nelson, but to paint their continued status as Arsenal players as some sort of failure is ludicrous.\n\nThough perhaps not quite as ludicrous as the Express detailing 'five transfers to replace Eddie Nketiah' (who started 10 Premier League games last season) and kicking off with Victor Osimhen.\n\nMORE ON ARSENAL FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Five-year Premier League net spend table has Arsenal in third\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Ruthless Arsenal signing named most exciting Premier League virgin\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Arsenal transfer to be 'completed at any moment' as talks with Tottenham target 'accelerate'\n\nAlv a world away\n\nObviously Julian Alvarez is off that potential list of Eddie Nketiah replacements as he appears to be Atletico-bound.\n\nWhich is very clear when you see this headline in the Mirror:\n\nArsenal's Julian Alvarez tactic as Man City striker moves closer to blockbuster transfer\n\nIt's obviously an unfortunate misunderstanding that it sounds very much like the Man City striker is 'moving closer to blockbuster transfer' to Arsenal; we're sure they will change that soon.\n\nBut what's this 'tactic'? What's this 'action or strategy carefully planned to achieve a specific end'?\n\nMirror Football understands that Arsenal were among the teams monitoring the situation, having previously signed the likes of Gabriel Jesus and Oleksandr Zinchenko from City.\n\nSo their 'tactic' was to 'monitor the situation'? That, ladies and gentlemen, is one hell of an action or strategy carefully planned to achieve a specific end. It's just a shame that the specific end did not materialise.\n\nIt's probably because they've failed to offload Reiss Nelson. Losers.\n\nI can see clearly now...\n\nBack to those Arsenal outgoings and football.london claim that 'Mikel Arteta offers glimpse into next summer deals during pre-season with subtle statement made' under the headline of 'Arsenal next five transfers after pre-season decided as clear Mikel Arteta message sent'.\n\nIt's really, really sodding subtle (but also 'clear', which is slightly confusing) but if you look very, very carefully (and Central Audience Football Writer Tom Coley is a man who looks very, very carefully before centrally writing for an audience), you will see that Karl Hein has no future at Arsenal because he has played every minute of pre-season so far, while Aaron Ramsdale is also surplus to requirements despite not playing at all. We told you this sh*t was subtle/clear.\n\nPre-season for the pair of them has so far been skewed but does not hide the fact that tough transfer decisions must be made sooner rather than later\n\nIt absolutely does not hide that fact.\n\nWe are also told that Reiss Nelson 'is not part of the main plans' despite playing a lot of football in pre-season, which was clearly both a 'clear Mikel Arteta message' and a 'subtle statement'. It's a difficult trick to pull off but Nelson, Eddie Nketiah and Jakub Kiwior have prompted Mikel Arteta to do exactly that.\n\nIf pre-season has given an indication as to how anyone is viewed, then it's these five.\n\nIs it as back-up to the missing first-team players but essentially available for transfer if the right fee is offered? Like every other fringe player at every other Premier League club?\n\nPrice of admission\n\nOn the incoming front, there will be no Arsenal move for Nico Williams. And how do we know this? Is it because Arsenal have not made an offer and he has not actually been remotely linked with the Gunners since June?\n\nOr is it, as per football.london, that 'Nico Williams 'confirms' final Arsenal transfer decision amid \u00a349m issue'.\n\nYou could argue that he had no Arsenal transfer decision to make but that would be churlish, especially in the wake of this latest development:\n\nArsenal target Nico Williams has hinted he could now be staying at Athletic Club after admitting he is looking forward to the 2024/25 season.\n\nNow that is quite the 'admission'.

However, four more players; Aaron Ramsdale, Eddie Nketiah, Kieran Tierney and Reiss Nelson, are still on the books, despite the Gunners making it clear they would entertain offers for them.\n\nWith the arrivals of David Raya and Riccardo Calafiori for substantial fees, as well as Mikel Merino's imminent \u00a325million move, Arsenal will need to their unwanted stars to make way if they're planning on bringing in more talent this summer.\n\nSambi-Lokonga was the first of the castaways to exit this window, moving to Sevilla on a season-long loan. The Belgian joined Arsenal in 2021 for \u00a317m but has so far failed to impress, having been loaned out to Crystal Palace and Luton Town.\n\nThose moves didn't convince Arteta enough to include Lokonga in his first-team plans, leading to the 24-year-old midfielder being shipped out to La Liga. Elsewhere, Portuguese defender Tavares has left on loan, joining Serie A side Lazio following temporary stints with Marseille and Nottingham Forest.\n\nThe most significant departure however has been Smith Rowe, who made a switch to Fulham for an initial \u00a327m - a figure that could potentially rise to \u00a335m. The Hale End graduate was once tipped for greatness at the Emirates Stadium but his young career has been marred by injuries, and Arteta's style of play doesn't particularly suit the Englishman.\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal handed double Julian Alvarez transfer blow after honest Pep Guardiola admission\n\nREAD MORE: Calafiori decision, Raya returns, Xhaka meets Rice again - Dream Arsenal XI vs Bayer Leverkusen\n\nHis hefty transfer fee helps Arsenal balance their financial books, setting them up nicely should they wish to bring in another high-profile name, as his sale counts as 100 per cent profit against the Premier League PSR rules. Nketiah's potential sale would also be counted as 100 per cent profit, but his move to Marseille is currently uncertain.\n\nArsenal have reportedly turned down three offers for the 25-year-old forward, as their \u00a330m valuation has not been met. However, it appears that Marseille have now reached out to Borussia Dortmund regarding striker Youssoufa Moukoko, suggesting that Arsenal may need to seek other avenues to offload Nketiah.\n\nRamsdale, who spent last season as Arteta's No. 2 between the sticks, is yet to secure a move away, with Newcastle showing the most interest. However, the Magpies are reluctant to meet Arsenal's steep \u00a350m asking price. Southampton have also been linked with a move for the goalkeeper.\n\nScottish defender Tierney, who joined the Gunners for \u00a325m in 2019 from Celtic, has also been linked with a move away. Despite becoming a fan favourite in north London, rumours suggest he could be set for a return to Celtic.\n\nThe left-back has been put on the market for a mere \u00a310m and it's highly probable he'll be leaving.

The Gunners welcome Gary O'Neil's side to Emirates Stadium on Saturday, August 17 and have just one pre-season friendly remaining before then.\n\nLyon travel to the capital on Sunday to take part in the latest edition of the Emirates Cup, giving Mikel Arteta the perfect chance to give his squad one last run out before the real competition begins. Off the pitch, Arsenal have been equally as busy with David Raya and Riccardo Calafiori signing long-term deals.\n\nMore players could come through the door between now and the summer transfer window deadline of August 30. football.london understands Edu and Arteta are keen on signing a forward and there are constant cries for the club to bring in a prolific No.9. With this in mind, football.london has detailed what Arsenal's dream forward line might look like next season.\n\nViktor Gyokeres deal agreed\n\nOne player who has been tracked by Arsenal is Viktor Gyokeres. The Sporting CP striker has earned himself a reputation of being a clinical finisher in recent seasons. The 26-year-old scored 43 goals and assisted 15 times in 50 appearances in all competitions last campaign.\n\nHe is an out and out No.9, which is something that Arsenal do not possess currently. Gabriel Jesus and Kai Havertz are fantastic strikers but do not possess the clinical edge, while Eddie Nketiah could depart this summer and was never going to be first choice under Arteta.\n\nREAD MORE: Martin Zubimendi to Liverpool transfer explained amid Arsenal questions around Mikel Arteta plan\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal transfer news LIVE - Martin Zubimendi move, Mikel Merino delay, Wilfred Zaha chance\n\nGyokeres has a release clause of \u00a386million but Arsenal would want to drive that price down as much as possible. Having just sold Emile Smith Rowe to Fulham in a deal worth up to \u00a334million and Nketiah linked with a \u00a325million move away, the money to sign Gyokeres may just well be there.\n\nNico Williams signs\n\nArsenal have previously expressed an interest in signing Nico Williams but his form for Athletic Bilbao and Spain has also seen him attract attention from Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain. The 22-year-old, who operates on the left-wing, would be an upgrade on Gabriel Martinelli, who had a difficult year last season. Leandro Trossard, who also played on the left for periods, has already shown his versatility by playing as a striker and on the right at times so would be a good back up option should Williams join.\n\nWilliams has a release clause in his contract of around \u00a348million but this would need to be paid upfront, which again could be a stumbling block. There's no doubt, however, that Arteta would love to sign Williams should Arsenal be able to afford the Spaniard.\n\nGabriel Jesus role\n\nThere's no question that Bukayo Saka is Arsenal's first choice right winger. The Hale Ender is world class and his 34 goal contributions last season proves that.\n\nHowever, the Englishman has looked tired on occasions, mostly because Arteta does not have an able deputy. This is where Gabriel Jesus could come in. The Brazilian showed he can play on the right under Pep Guardiola at Manchester City and could again do a job for Arsenal in this position.\n\nIf Gyokeres signs then Jesus could be a perfect squad player, able to play both as a striker and on the right when needed.\n\nTwo players to exit\n\nFor Eddie Nketiah and Arsenal, it appears a good time for both parties to part ways this summer. The 25-year-old is attracting attention from Marseille and will be allowed to leave if the Ligue 1 side match the Gunners valuation of the Englishman.\n\nReiss Nelson is probably another who should be allowed to move on. The 24-year-old was electric during the pre-season tour of the United States and only signed a new long-term deal last summer.

Arsenal finished just two points behind Pep Guardiola's men last season domestically.\n\nEddie Nketiah has been the subject of interest from Marseille over the last few weeks, with the Ligue 1 side reported to have submitted a bid in the region of \u00a316.8m. Kai Havertz was Arteta's go-to man in attack last term but that could all soon be about to change.\n\nWATCH | The Tactical Reason Why Arsenal Didn't Win The Premier League\n\nChelsea are said to have cooled their interest in Napoli superstar Victor Osimhen, leaving the door seemingly wide open for Arsenal to go after a player they have long pursued, according to reports from DiMarzio.\n\nPSG remain on the 'trail' of the Nigerian striker, the report continues, with the Gunners also given a fighting chance of bringing the 25-year-old to the Premier League this summer. Osimhen is valued by Transfermarkt at a whopping \u20ac100million (\u00a386million).\n\nIn the meantime, Osimhen is waiting to see whether Napoli wishes to select him for their first game of the new season, a Coppa Italia match against Modena on August 10.\n\n\"I already know what I wanna do with my career since I've started, I've been the one taking my own decision and everything is working out well for me,\" Osimhen told the media earlier this year. \"Even though when I started it, it didn't go as well as planned.\n\n\"But I already have my plan, I already know what I want to do, the next step I want to take. So for now I just want to finish the season strong, go relax somewhere with my daughter, and then finally come up with the decision I've already made.\"\n\nFourFourTwo believes Osimhen is likely to end up at PSG, given they are on the hunt for a replacement after Kylian Mbappe's departure. He would be a huge coup for Arsenal but you feel as if his mind is already made up about an eye-catching move to Paris, given the wages he is likely to be offered.\n\nLiverpool want to scupper Arsenal's transfer plans with a marquee addition, while Mikel Arteta is close to a new buy.

With the signings done (the arrival of Riccardo Calafiori and the pending arrival of Mikel Merino) and the other anticipated deals (such as for a striker and a custodian), you should be confident.\n\nHaving said that, this might be a really exceptional summer for Arsenal, unlike previous summers when the club spent more money buying than selling. This summer could be quite different. If everything goes as planned, Arsenal could earn more than \u00a3100 million from player sales, perhaps breaking a club record for the cash raised from sales in a single transfer window.\n\nWe have already sold Nuno Tavares and Sambi Lokonga for around \u00a317.5 million. Emile Smith-Rowe also left for a deal worth \u00a334 million. The club expects Eddie Nketiah to depart after the trio's departure, with an asking price of \u00a330 million. We also anticipate that Reiss Nelson will fetch between \u00a320 and \u00a325 million.\n\nBy the time all five of these players leave, the North Londoners will have made around \u00a3100 million. If Arteta and Edu believe they still need to sell, there are two players who can increase Arsenal's revenue: Aaron Ramsdale and Oleksandr Zinchenko. Both of them might bring a combined fee of \u00a350 million.

For all the talk only two first-team additions have been made, and one of those is David Raya who hardly counts after spending last season in north London.\n\nEmile Smith Rowe is the only major exit of note as well, although Amario Cozier-Duberry leaving to join Brighton after not signing a new contract and Chido Obi-Martin closing in on a move to Manchester United are also significant in a different way. With less than a month until the transfer window closes, it hasn't been one to remember yet.\n\nThat doesn't mean it hasn't been effective and cannot yet be immensely rewarding or productive for Arsenal, but it has left Mikel Arteta with question marks across his squad. There are numerous players still in the squad who have little if no part to play in an ideal world, whereas there are still incomings to complete if the final step to overtaking Manchester City is to be made.\n\nAll of this can still happen, and the margin between being champions and finishing second has been so small for two years that Arsenal can be rightfully confident in challenging yet again without the need for wholesale changes. However, Arteta would have preferred early business and it hasn't proved possible.\n\nSo here, football.london has taken a look at just what might have happened in the summer transfer window for Arsenal in another universe. This is Arsenal's 2024 alternative transfer outcome.\n\nWilliams and Sesko sign\n\nRemarkably, getting both Nico Williams and Benjamin Sesko this summer would have cost around the same (in transfer fees) as buying Declan Rice last year did. Perhaps that shows that what is needed now, in alterations to the playing group rather than genuinely landscape-changing additions, is different to 12 months ago.\n\nREAD MORE: Calafiori decision, Raya returns, Xhaka meets Rice again - Dream Arsenal XI vs Bayer Leverkusen\n\nREAD MORE: Arsenal right to snub \u00a384m striker transfer as gamble leaves Edu leaning toward winger\n\nArsenal appeared to be right at the front of the queue for Sesko before he committed himself to RB Leipzig for another year at least. His contract theoretically keeps him in Germany until 2029 but come the summer of 2025 a transfer will be front and centre of everyone's minds.\n\nGiven Arsenal haven't signed a new striker since learning of Sesko's change of heart, it isn't unfeasible that they are in the pack again next year. In an alternate reality though, he is signed before even the Euros starts and Arteta has his striker.\n\nWilliams was never going to be purchased that early but during the European Championship talk of a move really did pick up. Arsenal were part of an equally big line of clubs keen to sign him but were this time further back.\n\nHe could have been the competition and backup for Bukayo Saka whilst offering left-wing explosive options as well. Like Sesko, Williams himself chose to stay at Athletic Bilbao rather than heading to a new club. It's not much of a stretch to think the Basque connection between himself and Arteta could have got this one done though.\n\nSales done early\n\nBy August 7 Arsenal's exit strategy wasn't much clearer than in early June. Talk of Aaron Ramsdale leaving, Reiss Nelson parting ways, and Eddie Nketiah getting a fresh start elsewhere is rife.\n\nAny lingering suggestions of Gabriel Jesus, Oleksandr Zinchenko, and/or Thomas Partey going has been so far squashed, but the same cannot be true of the English trio named above or for Jakub Kiwior. All four of Ramsdale, Nelson, Nketiah, and their Polish international defender could still leave and there is less than a fortnight until the new season.\n\nSorting the goalkeeper situation and clarifying Ramsdale's future (either simply getting him a good loan or selling him for the benefit of all parties) should have been done by now. As it turns out things are just as uncertain as they were at the start of the window.\n\nPossibly down to the failure to get replacements in, Arsenal haven't managed to quite revamp the squad as could have been possible. In another world they have completed the sales of squad players and spent the money received elsewhere. In Ramsdale's case, a new goalkeeper (older and ready to be a backup, so not Tommy Setford) could even have been found.\n\nArteta new contract\n\nWhat better way to round off a summer of big moves both in and out than to tie down the manager who has taken Arsenal back to where they believe they belong? If Arteta doesn't pen a new deal soon then talk of him being a successor for Pep Guardiola is going to ramp up no matter what either coach or club says.\n\nGuardiola could leave Manchester City at the end of the coming season and Arteta is a natural replacement. With time running down on his own contract at the Emirates Stadium, Arsenal won't want this to drag on, even if they are fully committed to their manager and he to them.\n\nPerhaps doing this during a busy summer with international tournaments, pre-season, and transfers isn't realistic. Arteta and Arsenal are relaxed about the situation and why wouldn't they be? But if there was a chance to cap things off with an announcement it would definitely go down well.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

The Belgian joined the Gunners in 2021 for a sizable \u00a317m but has so far failed to perform, having been shipped out to Crystal Palace and Luton Town.\n\nThese moves didn't impress Arteta enough for him to consider including Lokonga in his first-team plans, so the 24-year-old midfielder has been offloaded to La Liga.\n\nPortuguese defender Tavares also left on loan shortly after Lokonga, joining Serie A side Lazio after temporary spells with Marseille and Nottingham Forest.\n\nThe club's most significant sale, however, has been Smith Rowe, who joined London rivals Fulham for an initial \u00a327m - which could rise to \u00a335m. The Hale End graduate was tipped for great things at the Emirates but has been blighted by injury. Arteta's football has since progressed past the Englishman.\n\nHis sizable fee also helps Arsenal balance their books, putting them in good stead should they consider singing another big name, as he counts as 100 per cent profit against the Premier League PSR rules.\n\nThe prospective sale of Nketiah would also count as 100 per cent profit, but his move to Marseille has been put in doubt. Arsenal have reportedly rejected three bids for the 25-year-old striker, as their \u00a330m demand has not been met.\n\nHowever, the French outfit is now understood to have made contact with Borussia Dortmund over marksman Youssoufa Moukoko. The Gunners may have to look elsewhere to offload Nketiah, as it seems Marseille have chosen to contact alternative targets.\n\nFellow Englishman Ramsdale has also yet to secure a move away, with Newcastle showing the heaviest interest. However, the Magpies are unwilling to pay the Gunners' extortionate \u00a350m asking price to reunite Ramsdale with old boss Eddie Howe.\n\nAnother player linked with a reunion is Scottish defender Tierney. Arriving for \u00a325m in 2019 from Celtic, Tierney grew into a fan favourite at the Emirates but has since been linked with a return to the Bhoys.\n\nHe has been made available this summer for just \u00a310m and it is highly likely the left-back will depart. Celtic could show an interest, but they may not be able to afford his fee and wages.\n\nYoung winger Nelson, the final player on Arteta's list to offload, has piqued the interest of a range of Premier League clubs, reportedly including the promoted Leicester City. He is said to have a \u00a320m price tag but no formal offers have come in for him as of yet.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

FourFourTwo breaks it down position by position...\n\nVIDEO: Riccardo Calafiori Is The FINAL Piece Of Mikel Arteta's Jigsaw\n\nThis one's the easiest assignment of the lot, as Bukayo Saka is, and will remain, this team's key man on the right. Still only 22 and continuing to improve, you don't need us to tell you how important he is to this Arsenal side.\n\nOur first new face, as Saka gets some competition/backup in the shape of Wolves winger Pedro Neto. The 24-year-old has shown he can do it in the Premier League and he looks to be a good fit for Arsenal's style.\n\nAble to provide goals and assists, Neto would take some of the load off Saka as the Gunners look to compete on multiple fronts this season. This is a move that will have to be facilitated by a sale, however: Reiss Nelson is linked with an exit and sadly, not at the desired level.\n\nThis is where we take a swing and install Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen as the Gunners' main man up front. The Napoli star has a reported release clause of around \u00a3110million, so Arsenal could look to sell Gabriel Jesus and Eddie Nketiah to claw back some funds in order to land the 25-year-old who has been one of Serie A's most deadly strikers in recent years and should be heading into his prime years.\n\nOsimhen's weapons - pace, aerial ability and clinical eye for goal - mean he should be perfectly suited to the Premier League and if Arsenal's front line is clicking, it means he should get plenty of opportunities to score the goals that the Gunners will need to clock up in order to dethrone Manchester City.\n\nHe may be more expensive than other strikers linked, such as Ivan Toney or Viktor Gyokeres, but has a higher ceiling and is worth pushing the boat out for.\n\nBacking up Osimhen will be Kai Havertz, who is a very useful player to have in the squad. As stated above, Gabriel Jesus and Eddie Nketiah will have been sacrificed in this scenario in order to bring in the new No.9, but the German has grown in confidence as a central striker in recent months, looking at home in the position during Arsenal's run-in last season and at Euro 2024 this summer. His versatility of playing behind a striker means that he won't have to settle for the bench all the time, either.\n\nWhile Gabriel Martinelli's 2023/24 campaign didn't see him kick on again as he did in the previous season, he still remains a potent force on the left wing on his day and at 23 years old, is still to hit his prime. An increased competition for places on the flanks from Neto's arrival could be good for him.\n\nLeandro Trossard completes our rotation of wingers. The Belgium international remains a key part of the attacking puzzle in north London, able to fill in across the frontline.\n\nAt 29 years old, Trossard brings experience to the frontline, while the likes of Fabio Vieria can add further depth when needed. In our hypothetical situation, this is likely his final season with fewer appearances to show for it, before heading out the door next summer, two and a half years after signing for \u00a321m.

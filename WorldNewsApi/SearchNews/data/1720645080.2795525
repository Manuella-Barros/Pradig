{"id": 231336406, "title": "$35 Million Malibu Beach House's Moving Restoration Story", "text": "Built in the 1970s, Taylor Beach House lies right on Malibu beach and, after restoration, is now on sale for $35 million.Jerrold Lomax, a California-based architect, originally built this modernist home in the 1970s for an attorney. The spectacular residence remained in the attorney's hands until his death in 2012, when Malibu resident and real estate investor Lawrence Taylor bought it for his family after adoring it for decades.Taylor decided to contact the original architect. \"He walked through the front door, and tears were running down his face,\" said Taylor for Bloomberg. After 40 years of remaining untouched, Lomax had a plan to make this house a modern residence again.The plan was to bring as much daylight as possible into the home and move the bedrooms to the center of the house instead of the bathroom, which was placed there by Lomax in the 1970s.Unfortunately, a year after the project started, Taylor found out Lomax was in hospice, living his last days battling cancer. The renovation was taken on by Lomax's colleague and a friend, Zoltan Pali from SPF: architects.\"It was important to me that the renovation not compromise the ideals Jerry imbued; those being minimalism, functionalism, efficiency, and innovation,\" explains Zoltan Pali to Design Boom. \"The resulting transformation is certainly tangible, but this is still very much a Lomax house.\"Pali installed thinner window frames, a metal staircase, glass floors, and more features to ensure the house is bright at any time of the day and that the view of the ocean is not disturbed by anything.Now the house offers 5,000 square feet (465 square meters) of living space, 50 feet (15 meters) of beach frontage, and unobstructed ocean views from each floor. The sale also includes furniture designed specifically for this unique home.The dream houseLawrence Taylor admired the house for nearly 40 years. He lived only 17 houses away on Malibu beach and watched it being built. He already knew Jerrold Lomax and was enchanted by the uniqueness of the residence. When the opportunity arose to purchase his dream home, he did not hesitate.\"It's everything that I ever wanted,\" Taylor said for Bloomberg. \"And I got it.\"He began restoration plans immediately, working closely with Lomax and later with Pali to give the house of his dreams a new life. The entrance of the house goes through the garage, which is, according to Taylor, more of a showroom for his cars. Fortunately, the previous owner was also a car collector, so the house was always built to showcase the cars.Unfortunately, his family wants to live in their original residence, so Taylor has to pass the dream home on. The house is listed with Marcus Beck of Sotheby's International Realty\u2014Malibu Brokerage.", "summary": "Original architect returned to restore incredible beach house 40 years after building it", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/malibu-beach-house-architect-35-million-1909643", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2405967/taylor-beach-house.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:27:12", "author": "Anezka Pichrtova", "authors": ["Anezka Pichrtova"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.006}

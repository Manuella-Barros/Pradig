On Saturday, May 25, The Osbournes star, 71, was photographed out for dinner at Italian restaurant E. Baldi in Beverly Hills with Aimee, 40, who is rarely seen in public. The pair were photographed chatting while walking together as they each sported casual looks for their outing. Sharon wore a black cardigan and pants with a cap, which she accessorized with a white bag. Actress and singer Aimee, meanwhile, wore a white shirt tucked into loose-fitting jeans as she held a black bag and a matching black jacket over her arm. The mother-and-daughter duo\u2019s latest appearance comes after the pair were spotted out on a stroll together in Los Angeles in February. During their sunny walk together, the pair also opted for casual looks, with Sharon in a monochrome outfit and Aimee sporting a t-shirt, jeans and a blue jacket. Aimee is the eldest of Sharon and her husband Ozzy Osbourne\u2019s three children and the most private member of the Osbourne family. The actress and musician famously didn\u2019t participate in the Osbournes reality show, which launched the family to stardom during its run from 2002 to 2005. In the past, Sharon has spoken about how it broke her heart when Aim\u00e9e, at the age of 16, moved out of the family home to avoid being filmed in the show. \"I know that my eldest girl, Aim\u00e9e, left home at 16 and she couldn\u2019t live in our house because we were filming and it drove her insane,\" she said on The Talk in June 2018. \"She felt too that she didn\u2019t want to grow up on camera. She hated the idea \u2014 it was appalling to her.\" \"And so she left at 16 and I regret every day that she did,\" Sharon explained, adding \"She was happy, but it broke my heart when she moved.\" Aimee, meanwhile, later shared that she turned down starring in the reality series, which featured her younger siblings Kelly, 39, and Jack, 38, as she didn\u2019t want to sacrifice her privacy.

Speaking in a 2020 interview on New York's Q1043 radio program, Aimee said, \"For me, I had grown up around having a pretty well-known dad anyway, and ... I always really valued my privacy within that family.\u201d \"And for me personally, and for who I am, you know, as far as morally and also just to give myself a chance to actually develop into a human being as opposed to just being remembered for being a teenager, it didn't really line up with what I saw my future as.\u201d The lead singer of the band ARO, Aimee also shares a production company, Osbourne Media, with her brother Jack.", "summary": "The mother-daughter duo spent time together at Italian restaurant E.

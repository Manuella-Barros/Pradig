{"id": 223739328, "title": "Citizens concerned about plans for new Montreal homeless shelter near schools, daycares", "text": "A plan for a new homeless shelter in Rosemont is raising concern among citizens. The city is in the midst of acquiring an old church to turn it into a new resource for the unhoused, but residents accuse authorities of ignoring their concerns about the proximity to multiple schools, daycares and playgrounds. Andr\u00e9 Gratien lives just steps from Sainte-Bibiane Church, and said his children play in a nearby green alleyway all the time. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to ask, is that the best location for this particular kind of project?\u201d he wonders. Gratien is among a group of citizens feeling tense about what\u2019s to come. He points out the high number of schools and daycares in the area. The city is in the midst of acquiring Sainte-Bibiane Church for $2.5 million with the goal of converting it into a 24/7 homeless shelter ready to accommodate 30 people at a time. \u201cWe are in a housing crisis. so we need those kind of services all around Montreal,\u201d explained Robert Beaudry, a city councillor and the executive committee member responsible for homelessness. Residents recognize more resources are needed, but feel the city is fast-tracking the project without enough consultation. \u201cWe\u2019re not saying no to the project. We\u2019re saying yes, let\u2019s just do it right,\u201d said Gratien. The city is hoping to finalize the purchase of the building in the coming months after it has done all its due diligence. The plan is to quickly begin renovations, then turn the space over to a community organization that will launch the facility in 2025. Beaudry says the provincial government has also committed to providing funding. \u201cIf it\u2019s well designed, if it\u2019s well founded, if it\u2019s a good size, it\u2019s going to be success,\u201d said Beaudry. With kids constantly walking or playing right next to the church, however, the residents think the city should slow down. A petition with over 1,000 signatures demands more consultation with the public on the subject. Gratien says only local residents were recruited to sign. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for the city to gather data on the needs of the local population, get that data to experts, get some studies done, and get those experts to make some recommendations based on best practices,\u201d said Gratien. He wonders why the city is moving forward without doing more analysis, and why citizens aren\u2019t being included in the conception of the project. \u201cThat\u2019s not transparency. That\u2019s not democratic either,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we want perennial, durable solutions, you need to do them properly and plan them out properly.\u201d A new resource for homeless people next to a school in Saint Henri caused concern among residents after city officials endorsed it. Another issue residents point out is there is already an organization in the church that helps migrants that\u2019s going to lose its space Global News met a man who didn\u2019t want to speak out but said he was being evicted from a residential portion of the church in a few weeks, and had no place to live. \u201cWe had to tell the city they were there,\u201d Gratien said, accusing the city of not even knowing there were people already living in the building. Beaudry said the city will help the current tenants find a place to live and operate, whether it\u2019s in the new version of the church or not. \u201cWe\u2019re going to accompany them if it\u2019s going to be there or elsewhere. We\u2019ll see,\u201d he said. The residents wonder why the city wouldn\u2019t put the homeless shelter in a more industrial area, rather than a neighbourhood bursting with young families. \u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to find a place where you are not close to something,\u201d said Beaudry. Rosemont resident Ellen Sheehy, who said she has lived in the area for more than 30 years, expressed concern as well, wondering aloud if the city is being \u201cincompetent.\u201d She is, however, hopeful that the new shelter can be properly executed. \u201cIf there\u2019s proper supervision, if there\u2019s the organization that is putting them there, if they\u2019re prepared to commit to taking care of it, I have no problem with it,\u201d she said. Beaudry blames the lack of consultation with the population on the fact that it\u2019s just so early in the process. \u201cWe already committed to involve the population in the process,\u201d he told Global News. Gratien feels they\u2019ve been hiding. \u201cIt has to be grassroots. It can\u2019t be top-down,\u201d he said. The citizens say they will keep putting pressure on the city until their voices are heard.", "summary": "The City of Montreal wants to turn an old, decrepit church in Rosemont into a homeless shelter.

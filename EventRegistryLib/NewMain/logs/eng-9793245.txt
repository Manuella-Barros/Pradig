In a televised address to the nation late Monday night, the president also ordered the release of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who is under house arrest after being convicted in several cases.\n\nNahid said the group earlier took 24 hours to announce the framework of the interim administration but the chaotic situation forced them to announce the name immediately.\n\nHe urged the president to take steps as soon as possible to form an interim government headed by Yunus whose experiment of poor men's banking earned Bangladesh the repute of being the home of microcredit.\n\nYunus is currently out of the country but welcomed the ouster of Hasina's regime, describing the development as the \"second liberation\" of the country.\n\nAccording to media reports, at least 119 people have been killed in the last two days of violence across Bangladesh.\n\nOn the widespread violence and looting, Nahid said it was being carried out by the \"ousted fascists and their collaborators\" to foil the revolution.\n\n\"As there is anarchy in the country, and insecurity over people's lives, we are urging the president to take immediate and effective steps to restore law and order in the country, and that freedom-seeking students will also be on the streets to assist law enforcement forces,\" he added.\n\n\"No government other than the one proposed by the students will be accepted. As we have said, no military government, or one backed by the military, or a government of fascists, will be accepted,\" Nahid said.\n\nYunus won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his anti-poverty campaign through the Grameen Bank, a mode; which was replicated across continents.\n\nHe had been in a protracted row with Hasina's government due to obscure reasons while authorities initiated a series of investigations against him after she came to power in 2008.\n\nBangladesh authorities launched a review of the statutory Grameen Bank's activities in 2011 and fired Yunus as its founding managing director on charges of violating the government retirement regulation.\n\nHe was charged under dozens of cases. In January, Yunus was sentenced to six months in jail by a court on charges of labour law violation.\n\nMany people believe Hasina became enraged when Yunus announced that he would form a political party in 2007 when the country was run by a military-backed government and Hasina was in prison.\n\nYunus, however, did not follow through on the plan but at that time he criticised Bangladeshi politicians alleging they were only interested in money.\n\nIn an interview, he expressed his desire to return and continue his work.

On Monday, the Chief of the Army in Bangladesh announced in a press conference that an interim government would be formed.\n\nOn the same evening, President Mohammad Shahabuddin held discussions with various leaders, during which he announced the formation of an interim government, the declaration of new elections, and the lifting of the curfew. He also ordered the release of opposition leader Khaleda Zia and all students arrested during the protests.\n\nStudent leaders who led the protests have stated they will not accept an interim government led by the military.\n\nIn a video released on the social media platform Facebook, the student leaders proposed an interim government led by economist Muhammad Yunus. They also urged the president to dissolve parliament by 3 pm.\n\n\"We call on the citizens to ensure this movement is not hijacked,\" the student leaders said. They also mentioned that the names proposed for the interim government would be announced soon.\n\nMeanwhile, news agency Reuters reported that Nobel laureate Yunus has accepted the proposal to become the chief advisor of the interim government. Quoting his spokesperson, Reuters reported that Yunus would return to Bangladesh after a routine health check in Paris. He had been in France at the invitation of the Olympic Committee.\n\nBangladesh's daily newspaper, The Daily Star, quoted Yunus saying, \"When I was first contacted by the students, I did not accept. I said I had a lot of work to do. But the students repeatedly requested me.\"\n\nHe stated, \"The students and the citizens of the country have made many sacrifices,\" adding that he was ready to take responsibility. Yunus also mentioned that he would soon return to Bangladesh.\n\nYunus is a rival of the ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The 84-year-old is known as the \"banker to the poor.\"\n\nHe founded Grameen Bank and microfinance institutions targeting those living below the poverty line. For this, Yunus and Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.\n\nIn January, a Bangladeshi court sentenced Yunus to prison for violating the country's labour laws. However, he criticised the charges as politically motivated.\n\nFollowing Sheikh Hasina's resignation and departure, the Bangladeshi military has taken the initiative to form an interim government. However, the leadership of this interim government has not yet been finalized.\n\nMoreover, President Mohammad Shahabuddin of Bangladesh has dissolved the parliament.\n\nIn a statement, President Shahabuddin announced, \"The 12th Parliament has been dissolved with the agreement of the Bangladesh Army, top leaders of various political parties, civil society, and student movement leaders.\"\n\nA press release from the President's Office also noted the release of opposition leader Khaleda Zia from prison.\n\nAt least 300 people have died during the two-month-long protests against the decision

He praised the students for bringing together and \"liberating Bangladesh\" and accused Hasina of destroying the legacy of her father Bangladesh's founder Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.\n\nBangladesh descended into chaos on Monday as Prime Minister Hasina surreptitiously resigned and fled the country in a military aircraft while the Army stepped in to fill the power vacuum.\n\nAs the news of Hasina's departure spread, hundreds of people broke into her residence, vandalising and looting the interiors, providing dramatic expression to the anti-government protests that have killed more than 300 people in a fortnight.\n\nHasina's residence Sudha Sadan and other establishments were attacked, vandalised and set on fire in the capital after her departure. The residences and business establishments of ministers, party MPs and leaders of Hasina's Awami League government were also attacked in Dhaka and outside Dhaka.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com",

The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement's coordinators announced the decision to choose Muhammad Yunus as chief advisor to the Bangladesh interim government on Tuesday.\n\nIn a video posted on social media early Tuesday morning, Nahid Islam, a key coordinator of the movement, confirmed that Yunus has agreed to take on this crucial role. The appointment comes in the wake of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's sudden resignation and departure from the country on Monday. Hasina reportedly fled in a military aircraft, leading to a power vacuum that prompted the Army to step in and form an interim government.

Bangladesh Unrest: Student Leaders Call for Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus to Head Interim Government After Sheikh Hasina Leaves Country.\n\nBorn on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong, Muhammad Yunus is a renowned social entrepreneur, banker, economist, and civil society leader. He earned his PhD in economics from Vanderbilt University in 1969 and later served as an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University.\n\nUpon returning to Bangladesh, Yunus headed the economics department at Chittagong University. He has been involved in various international advisory groups, including the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women, the Global Commission of Women's Health, the Advisory Council for Sustainable Economic Development, and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance. Bangladesh: Nobel Peace Prize Winner Muhammad Yunus Sentenced to Six Months in Jail for Violating Country's Labour Laws.\n\nIn response to the 1974 famine in Bangladesh, Yunus initiated long-term loans to help individuals start small ventures, leading to the creation of the Grameen Bank. Known as the \"banker to the poorest of the poor,\" Yunus and the Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2006 for their work in microcredit and microfinance.\n\nIn 2007, Yunus founded a political party named 'Nagarik Shakti' but later ruled out any possibility of contesting elections again. Earlier this year, Yunus served a six-month jail term for allegedly violating labour laws and has been charged in over 190 cases by the Awami League government led by Sheikh Hasina.", "source":

She landed at Hindon airport near Delhi in the evening and is expected to travel to the UK soon.\n\n'Bangladesh is liberated'\n\n\"We were an occupied country as long as she (Hasina) was there.

Today all the people of Bangladesh feel liberated&mldr; We are a free country now,\" Yunus said.\n\n\"They (people of Bangladesh) are feeling the sense of liberation and joy that we can start all over again...

He said: \"A very simple thing, you took away their (people's) right to vote. All the anger that they accumulated could not be expressed in any political way. So that came out as a simple demand for quota changes.

According to Dhaka Tribune, leaders of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement proposed an interim government led by Yunus. Amid uncertainty loomed over Bangladesh's future after ouster of Sheikh Hasina-led government, key student leaders Nahid Islam, Asif Mahmud, and Abu Bakar Mazumdar released a video message in which they announced Yunus' name as the next prime minister of the country.\n\n\"We took 24 hours to announce a framework for the interim government.

Bangladesh's army has temporarily taken control of the country, but it remains unclear what its role would be in an interim government after the country's president dissolved Parliament on Tuesday.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, one name has emerged that could take the reins in Bangladesh until fresh elections are announced: Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate who is also known as the \"banker to the poorest of the poor\" and was once called a \"bloodsucker\" by Hasina.\n\nStudent leaders who organized the protests want Yunus, who is currently in Paris for the Olympics, to head an interim government. He could not immediately be reached for comment, but one student leader said Yunus has agreed to step in.\n\nYunus, 83, is a well-known critic and opponent of Hasina. He called her resignation the country\u00b4s \"second liberation day.\"\n\nAn economist and banker by profession, Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering the use of microcredit to help impoverished people, particularly women. The Nobel Peace Prize committee credited Yunus and his Grameen Bank \"for their efforts to create economic and social development from below.\"\n\nFILE- Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus smiles as he arrives to appear before a labor court in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Sunday, Jan. 28, 2024. (AP Photo/Mahmud Hossain Opu, File)\n\nYunus founded Grameen Bank in 1983 to provide small loans to entrepreneurs who would not normally qualify to receive them. The bank\u00b4s success in lifting people out of poverty led to similar microfinancing efforts in other countries.\n\nYunus ran into trouble with Hasina in 2008 when her administration launched a series of investigations into him. Yunus had earlier announced he would form a political party in 2007 when the country was run by a military-backed government, although he did not follow through on the plan.\n\nDuring the investigations, Hasina accused Yunus of using force and other means to recover loans from poor rural women as the head of Grameen Bank. Yunus denied the allegations.\n\nHasina\u00b4s government began reviewing the bank\u00b4s activities in 2011, and Yunus was fired as managing director for allegedly violating government retirement regulations. He was put on trial in 2013 on charges of receiving money without government permission, including his Nobel Prize and royalties from a book.\n\nHe later faced more charges involving other companies he created, including Grameen Telecom, which is part of the country\u00b4s largest mobile phone company, GrameenPhone, a subsidiary of Norwegian telecom giant Telenor. In 2023, some former Grameen Telecom workers filed a case against Yunus accusing him of siphoning off their job benefits. He denied the accusations.\n\nEarlier this year, a special judge\u00b4s court in Bangladesh indicted Yunus and 13 others on charges over a $2 million embezzlement case. Yunus pleaded not guilty and is out on bail for now.\n\nYunus' supporters say he has been targeted because of his frosty relations with Hasina.\n\nYunus was born in 1940 in Chittagong, a seaport city in Bangladesh. He received his PhD from Vanderbilt University in the United States and taught there briefly before returning to Bangladesh.\n\nIn a 2004 interview with The Associated Press, Yunus said he had a \"eureka movement\" to establish Grameen Bank when he met a poor woman weaving bamboo stools who was struggling pay her debts.\n\n\"I couldn\u00b4t understand how she could be so poor when she was making such beautiful things,\" he recalled in the interview.\n\nSaaliq reported from New Delhi, India.\n\nFILE- Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus speaks to the media after he was granted bail by a court in an embezzlement case, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Sunday, March 3, 2024.

However, considering the emergency situation, we are announcing it now,\" Nahid said.\n\n\"We have decided that the interim government would be formed in which internationally renowned Nobel Laureate Dr Mohammad Yunus, who has wide acceptability, would be the chief adviser,\" said Nahid, flanked by two other coordinators.\n\nHis announcement comes hours after President Mohammed Shahabuddin said an interim government would be formed after dissolving the parliament as soon as possible.

Yunus denied the allegations.\n\nHasina's government began reviewing the bank's activities in 2011, and Yunus was fired as managing director for allegedly violating government retirement regulations. He was put on trial in 2013 on charges of receiving money without government permission, including his Nobel Prize and royalties from a book.\n\nHe later faced more charges involving other companies he created, including Grameen Telecom, which is part of the country's largest mobile phone company, GrameenPhone, a subsidiary of Norwegian telecom giant Telenor. In 2023, some former Grameen Telecom workers filed a case against Yunus accusing him of siphoning off their job benefits. He denied the accusations.\n\nEarlier this year, a special judge's court in Bangladesh indicted Yunus and 13 others on charges over a USD 2 million embezzlement case. Yunus pleaded not guilty and is out on bail for now.\n\nYunus' supporters say he has been targeted because of his frosty relations with Hasina.\n\nYunus was born in 1940 in Chittagong, a seaport city in Bangladesh. He received his PhD from Vanderbilt University in the United States and taught there briefly before returning to Bangladesh.\n\nIn a 2004 interview with The Associated Press, Yunus said he had a \"eureka movement\" to establish Grameen Bank when he met a poor woman weaving bamboo stools who was struggling pay her debts.\n\n\"I couldn't understand how she could be so poor when she was making such beautiful things,\" he recalled in the interview.

This came after Bangladesh President Mohammed Shahabuddin said an interim government would be formed after dissolving the parliament as Hasina fled the country.\n\nNahid Islam, one of the key coordinators of the movement, said that Prof Yunus has agreed to take on this crucial responsibility at the call of the student community to save the country, as per local media. Earlier, Nahid, Asif Mahmud, and Abu Bakar Mazumdar released a video message in which they announced Yunus' name as the next prime minister of the country.\n\n\"We have decided that the interim government would be formed in which internationally renowned Nobel Laureate Dr Mohammad Yunus, who has wide acceptability, would be the chief adviser,\" said Nahid, flanked by two other coordinators. Yunus, 84, has agreed to take the responsibility to \"save\" Bangladesh, they said. Nahid said the names of the other members of the interim government would be announced soon.\n\nNahid said the group earlier took 24 hours to announce the framework of the interim administration but the chaotic situation forced them to announce the name immediately. He urged the President to take steps as soon as possible to form an interim government headed by Yunus whose experiment of poor men's banking earned Bangladesh the repute of being the home of microcredit.\n\nIn January, Yunus was sentenced to six months in prison on a separate charge of violating labour laws but was granted bail while the sentence was challenged before the Supreme Court's High Court Division. He is believed to be living in Paris currently.\n\nThe massive protests in Bangladesh were initially against the controversial quota system in government jobs, but soon spiralled into a broader agitation against the Awami League government after Hasina's 'razakar' remarks and the harsh police crackdown on protesters. While the initial protests calmed down after the Supreme Court scaled back the quotas, the recent unrest broke out as several students demanded Hasina's resignation.\n\nWith police firings, mob beatings, and arson across the country, at least 135 people were killed in Bangladesh on Monday during unrest, according to Dhaka Tribune. The country announced on Monday that the clashes between demonstrators and members of the Awami League claimed the lives of at least 96 people in police firings. The protests culminated in Sheikh Hasina's abrupt resignation and departure from the country as several people stormed her official residence in Dhaka. Dramatic visuals showed protesters vandalising and pulling down the statue of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the 'Father of Bangladesh', at the Bijoy Sarani area.\n\nBangladesh's Army Chief will meet student protest leaders on Tuesday as the country awaits the formation of a new government. Traffic was lighter than usual in the usually chaotic streets of Dhaka and schools reopened with thin attendance after closing down in mid-July as protests against quotas in government jobs spiralled. \"I call upon the people of Bangladesh to display restraint and calm in the midst of this transitional moment on our democratic path,\" Tarique Rahman, the exiled acting chief of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), said in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\nArmy Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - to discuss the way ahead and said it was \"unanimously decided\" to immediately release BNP chairperson and Hasina's long-time nemesis, Khaleda Zia, who was convicted and jailed in a graft case in 2018. A BNP spokesperson said on Monday that Zia was in hospital and \"will clear all charges legally and come out soon\".", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microcredit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarique_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tarique Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Mujibur_Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Zia-ul-Haq", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Nationalist_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Nationalist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/08/muhammad-yunus-1722927854.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793245", "eventUri": "eng-9793245", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

File Image/Reuters\n\nAmidst the political turmoil in Bangladesh, following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement has put forward Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as their choice for the head of the interim government.\n\nThe student leaders, who have been at the forefront of a movement initially targetting job quota reforms, declared their preference for Yunus in a video early Tuesday morning.\n\nNahid Islam, a prominent figure in the movement, stated unequivocally, \"Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted. We wouldn't accept any army-supported or army-led government.\" Islam further stated that Yunus had agreed to take on this responsibility.\n\n\"We have decided that internationally renowned Nobel laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus will be appointed as the chief advisor in the interim government, and we have also spoken with Dr. Muhammad Yunus. He has agreed to take on this significant responsibility in response to the call of the students and public to safeguard Bangladesh,\" he said.\n\nWho is Muhammad Yunus?\n\nMuhammad Yunus was born on June 28, 1940, in the coastal city of Chittagong, Bangladesh. He grew up in a well-off family, with his father being a successful goldsmith. Yunus's early life was reportedly influenced heavily by his mother, who was known for her generosity towards those in need.\n\nYunus pursued higher education in the United States on a Fulbright scholarship, where he earned a PhD in economics. He returned to Bangladesh shortly after the country gained independence from Pakistan in 1971.\n\nHe became the head of the Economics Department at Chittagong University but soon found himself troubled by the severe poverty and famine affecting the nation. \"Poverty was all around me, and I could not turn away from it,\" Yunus once said. \"I found it difficult to teach elegant theories of economics in the university classroom&mldr; I wanted to do something immediate to help people around me.\"\n\nWhat is Muhammad Yunus's Grameen Bank?\n\nYunus's desire to make a tangible impact led him to experiment with providing small loans to impoverished people, primarily women, who lacked access to traditional banking services. This experimentation gave birth to the Grameen Bank in 1983, which offered microloans to help individuals invest in small businesses and improve their living conditions.\n\nGrameen Bank's innovative model has since been replicated in numerous countries, proving to be a powerful tool for poverty alleviation.\n\nAs of 2020, Grameen Bank had over nine million clients, with more than 97 per cent of its borrowers being women. Yunus's philosophy was simple yet revolutionary: even the poorest could work to bring about their development.\n\nThis approach earned him and the bank the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006, with the Nobel Committee acknowledging their efforts to create economic and social development from below.\n\nYunus awarded highest civilian award of the US\n\nBeyond the Nobel Peace Prize, Muhammad Yunus has received several other prestigious awards, including the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Yunus co-founded Yunus Social Business - Global Initiatives (YSB) with Saskia Bruysten, Sophie Eisenmann, and Hans Reitz. YSB works to create and empower social businesses worldwide, aligning with Yunus's vision of a humane capitalism.\n\nAlso Read | Sheikh Hasina in India: Why Bangladesh's embattled leader turned to New Delhi in her moment of crisis\n\nYunus also served as the Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland from 2012 to 2018 and has been involved with several organisations, including serving on the board of directors of the United Nations Foundation from 1998 to 2021.\n\nYunus catches Hasina's ire\n\nDespite his global acclaim, Yunus has faced significant challenges in his home country. His relationship with Bangladeshi PM Sheikh Hasina has been notably strained. Hasina has publicly criticised Yunus and Grameen Bank's microfinance practices, once referring to him as a \"blood-sucker of the poor.\"\n\nIn 2011, Yunus was removed from his position as the managing director of Grameen Bank on the grounds of exceeding the legal retirement age, a decision he contested but was upheld by Bangladesh's top court.\n\nYunus has been embroiled in several legal issues, including accusations of embezzlement and failing to establish a workers' welfare fund, for which he and three colleagues were sentenced to six months in jail -- a sentence immediately stayed pending appeal.\n\nThese charges have been widely criticised as politically motivated, with figures like Irene Khan, a former Amnesty International chief, describing the conviction as \"a travesty of justice.\"\n\nIn 2022, Grameen Telecom, a firm chaired by Yunus, faced a graft probe over allegations of embezzling employee funds. Critics argue that these legal battles are part of a broader effort to discredit Yunus due to his potential political influence and his previous attempts to establish the Nagorik Shakti (Citizen Power) party in 2007, which posed a challenge to Bangladesh's political elite.\n\nThe current situation&mldr;\n\nAmidst the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh, Yunus has remained a prominent figure. Despite the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement's call for him to lead an interim government, Yunus has publicly expressed reluctance to enter active politics. In an interview with news outlet The Print, Yunus stated, \"I am not the type to enter politics.\"\n\nHowever, with his agreement to serve as the chief advisor to an interim government, as stated by the student movement leaders, Yunus's role in shaping the future political landscape of Bangladesh remains a subject of keen interest and speculation.

Who is Muhammad Yunus?", "body": "DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) -- Bangladesh is in the midst of a major transition after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to flee the country after weeks of deadly protests initially over government jobs morphed into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule, which was marked by a rising economy but an increasingly authoritarian streak.\n\nThe downfall of Hasina's government -- she resigned Monday before fleeing to India -- has plunged the country into a political crisis with a battle for power now underway between leaders of the opposition parties and the powerful military. Bangladesh's army has temporarily taken control of the country, but it remains unclear what its role would be in an interim government after the country's president dissolved Parliament on Tuesday.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, one name has emerged that could take the reins in Bangladesh until fresh elections are announced: Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate who is also known as the \"banker to the poorest of the poor\" and was once called a \"bloodsucker\" by Hasina.\n\nStudent leaders who organized the protests want Yunus, who is currently in Paris for the Olympics, to head an interim government. He could not immediately be reached for comment, but one student leader said Yunus has agreed to step in.\n\nYunus, 83, is a well-known critic and opponent of Hasina. He called her resignation the country's \"second liberation day.\"\n\nAn economist and banker by profession, Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering the use of microcredit to help impoverished people, particularly women. The Nobel Peace Prize committee credited Yunus and his Grameen Bank \"for their efforts to create economic and social development from below.\"\n\nYunus founded Grameen Bank in 1983 to provide small loans to entrepreneurs who would not normally qualify to receive them. The bank's success in lifting people out of poverty led to similar microfinancing efforts in other countries.\n\nYunus ran into trouble with Hasina in 2008 when her administration launched a series of investigations into him. Yunus had earlier announced he would form a political party in 2007 when the country was run by a military-backed government, although he did not follow through on the plan.\n\nDuring the investigations, Hasina accused Yunus of using force and other means to recover loans from poor rural women as the head of Grameen Bank. Yunus denied the allegations.\n\nHasina's government began reviewing the bank's activities in 2011, and Yunus was fired as managing director for allegedly violating government retirement regulations. He was put on trial in 2013 on charges of receiving money without government permission, including his Nobel Prize and royalties from a book.\n\nHe later faced more charges involving other companies he created, including Grameen Telecom, which is part of the country's largest mobile phone company, GrameenPhone, a subsidiary of Norwegian telecom giant Telenor. In 2023, some former Grameen Telecom workers filed a case against Yunus accusing him of siphoning off their job benefits. He denied the accusations.\n\nEarlier this year, a special judge's court in Bangladesh indicted Yunus and 13 others on charges over a $2 million embezzlement case. Yunus pleaded not guilty and is out on bail for now.\n\nYunus' supporters say he has been targeted because of his frosty relations with Hasina.\n\nYunus was born in 1940 in Chittagong, a seaport city in Bangladesh. He received his PhD from Vanderbilt University in the United States and taught there briefly before returning to Bangladesh.\n\nIn a 2004 interview with The Associated Press, Yunus said he had a \"eureka movement\" to establish Grameen Bank when he met a poor woman weaving bamboo stools who was struggling pay her debts.\n\n\"I couldn't understand how she could be so poor when she was making such beautiful things,\" he recalled in the interview.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julhas_alam@seattletimes.com",

Who is Muhammad Yunus? | LatestLY", "body": "Dhaka, Aug 6 (AP) Bangladesh is in the midst of a major transition after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to flee the country after weeks of deadly protests initially over government jobs morphed into a broader challenge to her 15-year rule, which was marked by a rising economy but an increasingly authoritarian streak.\n\nThe downfall of Hasina's government -- she resigned Monday before fleeing to India -- has plunged the country into a political crisis with a battle for power now underway between leaders of the opposition parties and the powerful military.\n\nAlso Read | Suicide Cases in South Korea: Number of Suicides in Country Jumps Over 10% in 2024, Shows Government Data.\n\nBangladesh's army has temporarily taken control of the country, but it remains unclear what its role would be in an interim government after the country's president dissolved Parliament on Tuesday.\n\nAmid this uncertainty, one name has emerged that could take the reins in Bangladesh until fresh elections are announced: Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel laureate who is also known as the \"banker to the poorest of the poor\" and was once called a \"bloodsucker\" by Hasina.\n\nAlso Read | India Monitoring Situation With Regard to Minorities in Bangladesh, Says EAM S Jaishankar in Rajya Sabha (Watch Video).\n\nStudent leaders who organised the protests want Yunus, who is currently in Paris for the Olympics, to head an interim government. He could not immediately be reached for comment, but one student leader said Yunus has agreed to step in.\n\nYunus, 83, is a well-known critic and opponent of Hasina. He called her resignation the country's \"second liberation day.\"\n\nAn economist and banker by profession, Yunus was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering the use of microcredit to help impoverished people, particularly women. The Nobel Peace Prize committee credited Yunus and his Grameen Bank \"for their efforts to create economic and social development from below.\"\n\nYunus founded Grameen Bank in 1983 to provide small loans to entrepreneurs who would not normally qualify to receive them. The bank's success in lifting people out of poverty led to similar microfinancing efforts in other countries.\n\nYunus ran into trouble with Hasina in 2008 when her administration launched a series of investigations into him. Yunus had earlier announced he would form a political party in 2007 when the country was run by a military-backed government, although he did not follow through on the plan.\n\nDuring the investigations, Hasina accused Yunus of using force and other means to recover loans from poor rural women as the head of Grameen Bank. Yunus denied the allegations.\n\nHasina's government began reviewing the bank's activities in 2011, and Yunus was fired as managing director for allegedly violating government retirement regulations. He was put on trial in 2013 on charges of receiving money without government permission, including his Nobel Prize and royalties from a book.\n\nHe later faced more charges involving other companies he created, including Grameen Telecom, which is part of the country's largest mobile phone company, GrameenPhone, a subsidiary of Norwegian telecom giant Telenor. In 2023, some former Grameen Telecom workers filed a case against Yunus accusing him of siphoning off their job benefits. He denied the accusations.\n\nEarlier this year, a special judge's court in Bangladesh indicted Yunus and 13 others on charges over a USD 2 million embezzlement case. Yunus pleaded not guilty and is out on bail for now.\n\nYunus' supporters say he has been targeted because of his frosty relations with Hasina.\n\nYunus was born in 1940 in Chittagong, a seaport city in Bangladesh. He received his PhD from Vanderbilt University in the United States and taught there briefly before returning to Bangladesh.\n\nIn a 2004 interview with The Associated Press, Yunus said he had a \"eureka movement\" to establish Grameen Bank when he met a poor woman weaving bamboo stools who was struggling pay her debts.\n\n\"I couldn't understand how she could be so poor when she was making such beautiful things,\" he recalled in the interview.

The announcement comes hours after President Mohammed Shahabuddin said an interim government would be formed as soon as possible after dissolving the parliament. In a televised address to the nation late Monday night, the president also ordered the release of former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who is under house arrest after being convicted in several cases.\n\nAccording to news agency PTI, Nahid said that the group earlier took 24 hours to announce the framework of the interim administration, but the chaotic situation forced them to announce the name immediately. He also urged the president to take steps as soon as possible to form an interim government headed by Yunus, whose experiment of poor men's banking earned Bangladesh the repute of being the home of microcredit.\n\nYunus is currently out of the country but welcomed the ouster of Hasina's regime, describing the development as the \"second liberation\" of the country.\n\nWho Is Mohammad Yunus?\n\nProfessor Yunus played a key role in establishing the Grammen Bank in Bangladesh in 1983. He worked with the intention of helping the poor, especially those from poor backgrounds who could take loans from the bank on their own terms. Yunus was born in 1940 in the seaport city of Chittagong, Professor Yunus studied at Dhaka University in Bangladesh. He later got a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University.\n\nAccording to abp News, quoting nobelprize.org, Yunus received his Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt in 1969, and in the next year he became an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University. Later, he returned to Bangladesh and headed the economics department at Chittagong University. From 1993 to 1995, he was a member of the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women.\n\nYunus has earned numerous international awards, including the Mohamed Shabdeen Award for Science (1993), Sri Lanka; the Humanitarian Award (1993), CARE USA; World Food Prize (1994), World Food Prize Foundation, USA; lndependence Day Award (1987), among others.\n\nJaishankar To Address Parliament On Bangladesh Situation\n\nLok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Tuesday informed the lower house of Parliament that External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar will make a statement on the situation in Bangladesh.

Known as the \"banker to the poor\", he faced corruption accusations in Bangladesh and was put on trial during Hasina's rule, but maintained the charges against him were politically motivated.\n\nA spokesperson for Yunus said he had accepted the students' request to be an adviser to the interim government, the Reuters news agency reported. The Nobel laureate would return to Bangladesh \"immediately\" after a minor medical procedure in Paris, the spokesperson was quoted as saying.\n\nReporting from Dhaka, Al Jazeera's Tanvir Chowdhury said calm appeared to have largely been restored in the capital on Tuesday as the Students Against Discrimination movement called for calm, despite some lingering tensions.\n\nChowdhury said the movement would put forward more names on Tuesday morning and that their \"key demand\" had clearly been framed as non-negotiable. \"Unless those names are accepted, the students might come out again,\" he said.\n\nFollowing the removal of Hasina on Monday, army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said he was temporarily taking control of the country as soldiers tried to stem the growing unrest.\n\nHe said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - and announced that an interim government would run Bangladesh.\n\nHe also promised to investigate the deaths of at least 135 people across Bangladesh since mid-July in some of the country's worst bloodshed since the 1971 war of independence. \"Keep faith in the military. We will investigate all the killings and punish the responsible,\" he said.\n\nMohammed Shahabuddin, the country's figurehead president, announced that the interim government would hold new elections as soon as possible.\n\nHe said that it was \"unanimously decided\" to immediately release the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson and Hasina's nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia, who was convicted in a corruption case in 2018 but moved to a hospital a year later as her health deteriorated. She has denied the charges against her.\n\nThe United Nation's human rights chief, Volker Turk, said the transition of power in Bangladesh must be \"in line with the country's international obligations\" and \"inclusive and open to the meaningful participation of all Bangladeshis\".\n\nThe protests began peacefully last month as frustrated students demanded an end to a quota system for government jobs that they said favoured those with connections to the Hasina's Awami League party.\n\nThey then morphed into an unprecedented challenge to Hasina, amid a harsh crackdown by police, highlighting the extent of economic distress in the country.\n\nOn Monday, protesters defied a military curfew to march into the capital's centre, setting fire to Hasina's official residence and massing outside the parliament building, where a banner reading \"justice\" was hung.\n\nCrowds also ransacked Hasina's family ancestral home-turned-museum where her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman - the country's first president and independence leader - was assassinated.\n\nHasina, meanwhile, landed at a military airfield near New Delhi and met India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, according to Indian media reports, which also said that she was taken to a safe house and was likely to travel to the United Kingdom.\n\nIndian media reported that the government will hold an emergency meeting at parliament house on Tuesday to discuss the situation in Bangladesh.\n\nHasina, 76, had been in power since 2009 but was accused of rigging elections in January and then watched millions of people take to the streets over the past month demanding she step down.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

About 300 people were killed and thousands injured in violence that ripped through the country.\n\nGarment factories, which supply apparel to some of world's top brands and are a mainstay of the economy, will remain closed on Tuesday and plans to reopen will be announced later, the main garment manufacturers association said.\n\nStudent leaders, who spearheaded a movement against job quotas that turned into a call for Hasina to resign, said early on Tuesday that they want a new interim government with Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief adviser.\n\n\"Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted,\" Nahid Islam, one of the key organizers of the student movement, said in a video on Facebook with three other organizers. \"We wouldn't accept any army-supported or army-led government.\"\n\n\"We have also had discussions with Muhammad Yunus and he has agreed to take on this responsibility at our invitation,\" Islam added.\n\nYunus, 84, and his Grameen Bank won the 2006 Nobel Peace prize for work to lift millions out of poverty by granting tiny loans of under $100 to the rural poor of Bangladesh but he was indicted by a court in June on charges of embezzlement that he denied.\n\nReports said Yunus is currently in Paris and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. He told Indian broadcaster Times Now in a recorded interview that Monday marked the \"second liberation day\" for Bangladesh after its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.\n\nBut he said Bangladeshis were angry with neighbor India for allowing Hasina to land there after fleeing Dhaka.\n\n\"India is our best friend...people are angry at India because you are supporting the person who destroyed our lives,\" Yunus said.\n\nHasina landed at a military airfield at Hindon near Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka, two Indian government officials told Reuters, adding that India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met her there. They did not elaborate on her stay or plans.\n\nIndia's foreign minister was due to address an all-party meeting on Tuesday morning about the crisis in Bangladesh, Indian news agency ANI reported.\n\nFRESH ELECTIONS PLANNED\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman plans to meet the protest organizers at 12 noon local time (0600 GMT) on Tuesday, the army said in a statement, a day after Zaman announced Hasina's resignation in a televised address and said an interim government would be formed.\n\nJubilant crowds stormed unopposed into the opulent grounds of Hasina's residence after she fled, carrying out looted furniture and TVs. One man balanced a red velvet, gilt-edged chair on his head. Another held an armful of vases.\n\nZaman said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties -- excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League -- to discuss the way ahead and was due to hold talks with the president, Mohammed Shahabuddin.\n\nAn interim government will hold elections as soon as possible after consulting all parties and stakeholders, President Shahabuddin said in a televised address late on Monday.\n\nHe also said that it was \"unanimously decided\" to immediately release the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson and Hasina's nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia, who was convicted in a graft case in 2018 but moved to a hospital a year later as her health deteriorated. She has denied the charges against her.\n\nA BNP spokesperson said on Monday that Zia, 78, was in hospital and \"will clear all charges legally and come out soon.\"\n\nHasina, 76, had ruled since winning a decades-long power struggle with Zia in 2009.\n\nThe Indian Express newspaper reported that Hasina was taken to a \"safe house\" after her arrival at Hindon and she was likely to travel to the United Kingdom.

Bangladeshi Nobel Laureate Backed By Student Leaders As 'Chief Adviser To Interim Govt'", "body": "Bangladesh Violence: Following the announcement of interim elections in Bangladesh after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation amid widespread violent anti-quota protests, the coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement have announced an outline for an interim government headed by Nobel Laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus.\n\nThe 83-year-old, known as the \"banker to the poorest of the poor,\" won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. According to Dhaka Tribune, the video message by key coordinators of the student movement was conveyed by Nahid Islam, Asif Mahmud, and Abu Bakar Mazumdar on Tuesday.\n\nThe organisers proposed Mohammad Yunus's name as the chief advisor of the interim government. In the video posted on social media early this morning, Nahid Islam, one of the key coordinators of the movement, said they have already talked with Yunus, and he has given his consent considering the present situation of the country, as reported by Bangladesh English Daily The Daily Star.\n\nReferring to the indiscriminate firing and attacks on temples and widespread looting in various places, Nahid said, \"We took 24 hours to announce a framework for the interim government. However, considering the emergency situation, we are announcing it now\".\n\n\"We have decided that the interim government would be formed in which internationally renowned Nobel Laureate Dr. Mohammad Yunus, who has wide acceptability, would be the chief adviser,\" Nahid announced. \"We want to see the process rolling by the morning. We urge the president to take steps as soon as possible to form an interim government headed by Dr. Yunus,\" he further stated.\n\n\"And we will also announce the names of the remaining members of the interim government by morning.\" Earlier Monday night, Nahid announced that an interim government outline would be formulated within the next 24 hours. However, the coordinators decided to announce their stance as quickly as possible.\n\nProfessor Muhammad Yunus played a pioneer role in establishing the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1983. His aim was to help poor people escape from poverty by providing loans on terms suitable to them and by teaching them a few sound financial principles so they could help themselves.\n\nBorn in 1940 in the seaport city of Chittagong, Professor Yunus studied at Dhaka University in Bangladesh. Later, he received a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University.\n\nAccording to the website nobelprize.org, Yunus received his Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt in 1969, and in the next year he became an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University.\n\nFollowing his return to Bangladesh, Yunus headed the economics department at Chittagong University. From 1993 to 1995, he was a member of the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women.\n\nHe has served on the Global Commission of Women's Health, the Advisory Council for Sustainable Economic Development, and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance.\n\nYunus is the recipient of numerous international awards for his ideas and endeavors, including the Mohamed Shabdeen Award for Science (1993), Sri Lanka; Humanitarian Award (1993), CARE, USA; World Food Prize (1994), World Food Prize Foundation, USA; lndependence Day Award (1987), Bangladesh's highest award; King Hussein Humanitarian Leadership Award (2000), King Hussien Foundation, Jordan; Volvo Environment Prize (2003), Volvo Environment Prize Foundation, Sweden; Nikkei Asia Prize for Regional Growth (2004), Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan; Franklin D. Roosevelt Freedom Award (2006), Roosevelt Institute of The Netherlands; and the Seoul Peace Prize (2006), Seoul Peace Prize Cultural Foundation, Seoul, Korea. He is a member of the board of the United Nations Foundation.\n\nMuhammad Yunus had back in 2007 floated a political party named 'Nagarik Shakti'. But he ruled out any possibility of contesting elections again. \"I am not a politician, I am not fit for that kind of job,\" he said, while speaking to ABP LIVE.\n\n\"I'll try to be as miles away as possible from politics...I don't want to get involved in politics ...I do things for people and I know how to do that and I love that. Some people like it, some dislike it but my work goes on.

As we have said, no military government, or one backed by the military, or a government of fascists, will be accepted,\" Nahid said.\n\nBangladesh descended into chaos on Monday as Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina surreptitiously resigned and fled the country in a military aircraft while the Army stepped in to fill the power vacuum.\n\nAs the news of Hasina's departure spread, hundreds of people broke into her residence, vandalising and looting the interiors, providing dramatic expression to the anti-government protests that have killed more than 300 people in a fortnight.\n\nHasina's residence Sudha Sadan and other establishments were attacked, vandalised and set on fire in the capital after her departure. The residences and business establishments of ministers, party MPs and leaders of Hasina's Awami League government were also attacked in Dhaka and outside Dhaka.

She was behaving like an occupation force, a dictator, a general, controlling everything.

He also expressed hope that the same students and young people will be leading Bangladesh in the right direction in future.\n\nMuhammad Yunus explained that seething anger against Sheikh Hasina could not be expressed in a political way due to a series of rigged general elections. \"So that came out as a simple demand for quota changes. It immediately caught up because the government behaved the same way, attacking them rather than listening to them because they are not in a listening mood at all,\" Yunus told The Print.\n\nThe professor is not sure of what role the opposition party will play as they never had a chance to fairly contest the general elections. Main opposition party Bangladesh National Party (BNP) led by ex-prime minister Khaleda Zia, who will be released after Hasina fled, has been under constant attack from the government.\n\nYunus, currently on bail, hoped to see a lot of changes once a fair general election is held in Bangladesh. As an advice, he asked Bangladeshis to be wary of past mistakes and stick to democratic principles. \"As long as we stick to that you remain a strong country.

About 300 people were killed and thousands injured in violence that ripped through the country.\n\nGarment factories, which supply apparel to some of the world's top brands and are a mainstay of the economy, will remain closed Tuesday and plans to reopen will be announced later, the main garment manufacturers association said.\n\nStudent leaders, who spearheaded the anti-quota movement that turned into a call for Hasina to resign, said early Tuesday they want Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser to the interim government.\n\n\"Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted,\" Nahid Islam, one of the key organizers of the student movement, said in a video on Facebook with three other organizers. \"We wouldn't accept any army-supported or army-led government.\"\n\n\"We have also had discussions with Muhammad Yunus and he has agreed to take on this responsibility at our invitation,\" Islam added.\n\nYunus, 84, and his Grameen Bank won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for work to lift millions out of poverty by granting tiny loans of under $100 to the rural poor of Bangladesh but he was indicted by a court in June on charges of embezzlement that he denied.\n\nYunus is undergoing minor medical procedures in Paris, his press secretary Sabbir Osmani said, but did not immediately comment on the statements from the student leaders.\n\nThe Nobel laureate told Indian broadcaster Times Now in a recorded interview that Monday marked the \"second liberation day\" for Bangladesh after its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.\n\nBut he said Bangladeshis were angry with neighbor India for allowing Hasina to land there after fleeing Dhaka.\n\n\"India is our best friend ... people are angry at India because you are supporting the person who destroyed our lives,\" Yunus said.\n\nHasina landed at a military airfield at Hindon near Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka, two Indian government officials told Reuters, adding that India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met her there. They did not elaborate on her stay or plans.\n\nIndia's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar addressed a closed-door all-party meeting in parliament Tuesday morning about the crisis in Bangladesh. \"Appreciate the unanimous support and understanding that was extended,\" he said on X, without elaborating.\n\nBangladesh army chief Gen.

One man balanced a red velvet, gilt-edged chair on his head. Another held an armful of vases.\n\n\"I call upon the people of Bangladesh to display restraint and calm in the midst of this transitional moment on our democratic path,\" Tarique Rahman, the exiled acting chief of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), said in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\n\"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution ... if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\" he added.\n\nArmy Chief Zaman said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - to discuss the way ahead and was due to hold talks with the president, Mohammed Shahabuddin.\n\nAn interim government will hold elections as soon as possible after consulting all parties and stakeholders, President Shahabuddin said in a televised address late Monday.\n\nHe also said that it was \"unanimously decided\" to immediately release BNP chairperson and Hasina's nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia, who was convicted and jailed in a graft case in 2018 but moved to a hospital a year later as her health deteriorated.

About 300 people were killed and thousands injured in violence that ripped through the country.\n\nGarment factories, which supply apparel to some of world's top brands and are a mainstay of the economy, will remain closed on Tuesday and plans to reopen will be announced later, the main garment manufacturers association said.\n\nStudent leaders, who spearheaded a movement against job quotas that turned into a call for Hasina to resign, said early on Tuesday that they want a new interim government with Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief adviser.\n\n\"Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted,\" Nahid Islam, one of the key organisers of the student movement, said in a video on Facebook with three other organisers. \"We wouldn't accept any army-supported or army-led government.\"\n\n\"We have also had discussions with Muhammad Yunus and he has agreed to take on this responsibility at our invitation,\" Islam added.\n\nYunus, 84, and his Grameen Bank won the 2006 Nobel Peace prize for work to lift millions out of poverty by granting tiny loans of under $100 to the rural poor of Bangladesh but he was indicted by a court in June on charges of embezzlement that he denied.\n\nReports said Yunus is currently in Paris and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. He told Indian broadcaster Times Now in a recorded interview that Monday marked the \"second liberation day\" for Bangladesh after its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.\n\nBut he said Bangladeshis were angry with neighbour India for allowing Hasina to land there after fleeing Dhaka.\n\n\"India is our best friend...people are angry at India because you are supporting the person who destroyed our lives,\" Yunus said.\n\nHasina landed at a military airfield at Hindon near Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka, two Indian government officials told Reuters, adding that India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met her there. They did not elaborate on her stay or plans.\n\nIndia's foreign minister was due to address an all-party meeting on Tuesday morning about the crisis in Bangladesh, Indian news agency ANI reported.\n\nFRESH ELECTIONS PLANNED\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman plans to meet the protest organisers at 12 noon local time (0600 GMT) on Tuesday, the army said in a statement, a day after Zaman announced Hasina's resignation in a televised address and said an interim government would be formed.\n\nJubilant crowds stormed unopposed into the opulent grounds of Hasina's residence after she fled, carrying out looted furniture and TVs. One man balanced a red velvet, gilt-edged chair on his head. Another held an armful of vases.\n\nZaman said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - to discuss the way ahead and was due to hold talks with the president, Mohammed Shahabuddin.\n\nAn interim government will hold elections as soon as possible after consulting all parties and stakeholders, President Shahabuddin said in a televised address late on Monday.\n\nHe also said that it was \"unanimously decided\" to immediately release the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson and Hasina's nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia, who was convicted in a graft case in 2018 but moved to a hospital a year later as her health deteriorated. She has denied the charges against her.\n\nA BNP spokesperson said on Monday that Zia, 78, was in hospital and \"will clear all charges legally and come out soon\".\n\nHasina, 76, had ruled since winning a decades-long power struggle with Zia in 2009.\n\nThe Indian Express newspaper reported that Hasina was taken to a \"safe house\" after her arrival at Hindon and she was likely to travel to the United Kingdom.

About 300 people were killed and thousands injured in violence that ripped through the country.\n\nGarment factories, which supply apparel to some of world's top brands and are a mainstay of the economy, will remain closed on Tuesday and plans to reopen will be announced later, the main garment manufacturers association said.\n\nStudent leaders, who spearheaded the anti-quota movement that turned into a call for Hasina to resign, said early on Tuesday they want Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser to the interim government.\n\n\"Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted,\" Nahid Islam, one of the key organizers of the student movement, said in a video on Facebook with three other organizers. \"We wouldn't accept any army-supported or army-led government.\"\n\n\"We have also had discussions with Muhammad Yunus and he has agreed to take on this responsibility at our invitation,\" Islam added.\n\nYunus, 84, and his Grameen Bank won the 2006 Nobel Peace prize for work to lift millions out of poverty by granting tiny loans of under $100 to the rural poor of Bangladesh but he was indicted by a court in June on charges of embezzlement that he denied.\n\nYunus is undergoing minor medical procedures in Paris, his press secretary Sabbir Osmani said, but did not immediately comment on the statements from the student leaders.\n\nThe Nobel laureate told Indian broadcaster Times Now in a recorded interview that Monday marked the \"second liberation day\" for Bangladesh after its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.\n\nBut he said Bangladeshis were angry with neighbor India for allowing Hasina to land there after fleeing Dhaka.\n\n\"India is our best friend...people are angry at India because you are supporting the person who destroyed our lives,\" Yunus said.\n\nHasina landed at a military airfield at Hindon near Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka, two Indian government officials told Reuters, adding that India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met her there. They did not elaborate on her stay or plans.\n\nIndia's Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar addressed a closed door all-party meeting in parliament on Tuesday morning about the crisis in Bangladesh. \"Appreciate the unanimous support and understanding that was extended,\" he said on X, without elaborating.\n\nFresh elections planned\n\nBangladesh army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman plans to meet the protest organizers at 12 noon local time (0600 GMT) on Tuesday, the army said in a statement, a day after Zaman announced Hasina's resignation in a televised address and said an interim government would be formed.\n\nJubilant crowds stormed unopposed into the opulent grounds of Hasina's residence after she fled, carrying out looted furniture and TVs. One man balanced a red velvet, gilt-edged chair on his head. Another held an armful of vases.\n\n\"I call upon the people of Bangladesh to display restraint and calm in the midst of this transitional moment on our democratic path,\" Tarique Rahman, the exiled acting chief of the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), said in a post on X on Tuesday.\n\n\"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution...if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process,\" he added.\n\nArmy Chief Zaman said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties -- excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League -- to discuss the way ahead and was due to hold talks with the president, Mohammed Shahabuddin.\n\nAn interim government will hold elections as soon as possible after consulting all parties and stakeholders, President Shahabuddin said in a televised address late on Monday.\n\nHe also said that it was \"unanimously decided\" to immediately release BNP chairperson and Hasina's nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia, who was convicted and jailed in a graft case in 2018 but moved to a hospital a year later as her health deteriorated. Zia, 78, is BNP acting chief Rahman's mother and she has denied the charges against her.\n\nA BNP spokesperson said on Monday that Zia was in hospital and \"will clear all charges legally and come out soon\".\n\nHasina, 76, had ruled since winning a decades-long power struggle with Zia in 2009.\n\nThe Indian Express newspaper reported that Hasina was taken to a \"safe house\" after her arrival at Hindon and she was likely to travel to the United Kingdom.

Now, those who ousted her want Mr. Yunus, 84, to hold one of the most powerful positions in the new government.\n\n\"We have decided that an interim government should be formed with Nobel laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser,\" Nahid Islam, one of the student leaders, said on Tuesday morning. \"We have spoken with Dr. Yunus, and he has agreed to take on this significant responsibility.\"\n\nHowever, it remains unclear how much the student groups can influence the new governing arrangement and Mr. Yunus's role in it. The country's powerful military and other political parties will also have a say.\n\nHere's what to know about Mr. Yunus and his rise in Bangladesh.\n\nMr. Yunus was born in 1940 in the city of Chittagong. He went to the United States on a Fulbright Scholarship in the 1960s and received a Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt University. He returned to Bangladesh in the early 1970s and launched a project that gave small loans to the poor. In 1983, that service became Grameen Bank.\n\nThe bank grew steadily in the next decade, and its success, especially in extending loans to women, inspired microfinance projects in dozens of countries and garnered praise from world leaders.\n\nMr. Yunus and Grameen Bank received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for what the prize committee described as their efforts to provide financial opportunities to the poor.\n\nThe model was not favored by all, though. Some microfinance operators faced accusations of charging exorbitant interest rates and of predatory lending to the poor.\n\nWith the success of Grameen Bank, Mr. Yunus's stature grew internationally and at home.\n\nDespite his popularity, he largely steered clear of politics, but that changed in 2007, when Bangladesh was under a military-backed interim government. Mr. Yunus launched a political party, offering an alternative to a corruption-riddled political establishment.\n\nThat party didn't last long, and Mr. Yunus abandoned the idea. However, by then, analysts said he had offended some powerful figures, including Sheikh Hasina.\n\nMs. Hasina came to power through the 2008 election, winning a large majority and promising a prosperous return to democracy after years of political turmoil. But Ms. Hasina's critics say she used her power during her 15-year tenure to launch a campaign of reprisals against her political enemies and others who may threaten her rule, including Mr. Yunus.

The video was broadcast on the Facebook profile of Asif Mahmud, another key coordinator of the student movement.\n\nIn the video message, Nahid spoke alongside Asif Mahmud and Abu Baker Majumdar.\n\nAccording to Nahid, Yunus has agreed to their proposal to restore peace.\n\nHowever, amid intense protests, after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and left the country, Yunus dismissed rumours of entering active politics during an interview with the Indian news outlet, The Print. Currently in Paris, Yunus said, \"I am not the type to enter politics.\"\n\nNevertheless, coordinator Nahid emphasised in the video statement that the Nobel laureate has agreed to the proposal from the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement.\n\nHe said, \"We have decided that internationally renowned Nobel laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus will be appointed as the chief advisor in the interim government, and we have also spoken with Dr Muhammad Yunus. He has agreed to take on this significant responsibility in response to the call of the students and public to safeguard Bangladesh.\"\n\nNahid commented on their overnight message, \"After our uprising and revolution, fascists and their allies are causing chaos and sabotage. Shooting is still happening in various places. Temples are being attacked, and looting and sabotage are occurring. This sabotage is being orchestrated to thwart our uprising.\"\n\nIn the video lasting over three minutes, Nahid said, \"We are urging the freedom-seeking student-public to remain alert and vigilant. We had taken 24 hours to propose an interim government. According to the urgency of the situation, we are now announcing an outline.\n\n\"We want to see the process of forming this government by morning. There will be a call to the president to swiftly form an interim government with Dr Muhammad Yunus as the chief advisor.

We must fulfil our promise to form a new Bangladesh. And we will not accept any government other than the one proposed by the student-public.\"\n\nHe also called on the committee on the protection of communal harmony and state assets to keep watch in every neighbourhood. \"We must protect our minority community and our state assets, and our country.\"\n\nEarlier in the night, during discussions about the interim government at the press conference, he said, \"We will not support any government unless it is supported or proposed by the students and citizens.

About 300 people were killed and thousands injured in violence that ripped through the country.\n\nGarment factories\n\n, which supply apparel to some of world's top brands and are a mainstay of the economy, will remain closed on Tuesday and plans to reopen will be announced later, the main garment manufacturers association said.\n\nStudent leaders, who spearheaded a movement against job quotas that turned into a call for Hasina to resign, said early on Tuesday that they want a new interim government with Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief adviser.\n\n\"Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted,\" Nahid Islam, one of the key organisers of the student movement, said in a video on Facebook with three other organisers. \"We wouldn't accept any army-supported or army-led government.\"\n\n\"We have also had discussions with Muhammad Yunus and he has agreed to take on this responsibility at our invitation,\" Islam added.\n\nYunus, 84, and his Grameen Bank won the 2006 Nobel Peace prize for work to lift millions out of poverty by granting tiny loans of under $100 to the rural poor of Bangladesh but he was indicted by a court in June on charges of embezzlement that he denied.\n\nReports said Yunus is currently in Paris and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. He told Indian broadcaster Times Now in a recorded interview that Monday marked the \"second liberation day\" for Bangladesh after its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.\n\nBut he said Bangladeshis were angry with neighbour India for allowing Hasina to land there after fleeing Dhaka.\n\n\"India is our best friend...people are angry at India because you are supporting the person who destroyed our lives,\" Yunus said.\n\nHasina landed at a military airfield at Hindon near Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka, two Indian government officials told Reuters, adding that India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met her there. They did not elaborate on her stay or plans.\n\nIndia's foreign minister was due to address an all-party meeting on Tuesday morning about the crisis in Bangladesh, Indian news agency ANI reported.\n\nFRESH ELECTIONS PLANNED\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman plans to meet the protest organisers at 12 noon local time (0600 GMT) on Tuesday, the army said in a statement, a day after Zaman announced Hasina's resignation in a televised address and said an interim government would be formed.\n\nJubilant crowds stormed unopposed into the opulent grounds of Hasina's residence after she fled, carrying out looted furniture and TVs. One man balanced a red velvet, gilt-edged chair on his head. Another held an armful of vases.\n\nZaman said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - to discuss the way ahead and was due to hold talks with the president, Mohammed Shahabuddin.\n\nAn interim government will hold elections as soon as possible after consulting all parties and stakeholders, President Shahabuddin said in a televised address late on Monday.\n\nHe also said that it was \"unanimously decided\" to immediately release the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson and Hasina's nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia, who was convicted in a graft case in 2018 but moved to a hospital a year later as her health deteriorated. She has denied the charges against her.\n\nA BNP spokesperson said on Monday that Zia, 78, was in hospital and \"will clear all charges legally and come out soon\".\n\nHasina, 76, had ruled since winning a decades-long power struggle with Zia in 2009.\n\nThe Indian Express newspaper reported that Hasina was taken to a \"safe house\" after her arrival at Hindon and she was likely to travel to the United Kingdom. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

REUTERS/Mohammad Ponir Hossain\n\nBy Ruma Paul\n\nDHAKA (Reuters) -Bangladesh's army chief will meet student protest leaders on Tuesday as the country awaits the formation of a new government a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled following a violent uprising against her.\n\nTraffic was lighter than usual in Dhaka and schools reopened with thin attendance after closing down in mid-July as the anti-quota protests spiralled. About 300 people were killed and thousands injured in violence that ripped through the country.\n\nGarment factories, which supply apparel to some of world's top brands and are a mainstay of the economy, will remain closed on Tuesday and plans to reopen will be announced later, the main garment manufacturers association said.\n\nStudent leaders, who spearheaded a movement against job quotas that turned into a call for Hasina to resign, said early on Tuesday that they want a new interim government with Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief adviser.\n\n\"Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted,\" Nahid Islam, one of the key organisers of the student movement, said in a video on Facebook with three other organisers. \"We wouldn't accept any army-supported or army-led government.\"\n\n\"We have also had discussions with Muhammad Yunus and he has agreed to take on this responsibility at our invitation,\" Islam added.\n\nYunus, 84, and his Grameen Bank won the 2006 Nobel Peace prize for work to lift millions out of poverty by granting tiny loans of under $100 to the rural poor of Bangladesh but he was indicted by a court in June on charges of embezzlement that he denied.\n\nReports said Yunus is currently in Paris and he did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. He told Indian broadcaster Times Now in a recorded interview that Monday marked the \"second liberation day\" for Bangladesh after its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.\n\nBut he said Bangladeshis were angry with neighbour India for allowing Hasina to land there after fleeing Dhaka.\n\n\"India is our best friend...people are angry at India because you are supporting the person who destroyed our lives,\" Yunus said.\n\nHasina landed at a military airfield at Hindon near Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka, two Indian government officials told Reuters, adding that India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met her there. They did not elaborate on her stay or plans.\n\nIndia's foreign minister was due to address an all-party meeting on Tuesday morning about the crisis in Bangladesh, Indian news agency ANI reported.\n\nFRESH ELECTIONS PLANNED\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman plans to meet the protest organisers at 12 noon local time (0600 GMT) on Tuesday, the army said in a statement, a day after Zaman announced Hasina's resignation in a televised address and said an interim government would be formed.\n\nJubilant crowds stormed unopposed into the opulent grounds of Hasina's residence after she fled, carrying out looted furniture and TVs. One man balanced a red velvet, gilt-edged chair on his head. Another held an armful of vases.\n\nZaman said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - to discuss the way ahead and was due to hold talks with the president, Mohammed Shahabuddin.\n\nAn interim government will hold elections as soon as possible after consulting all parties and stakeholders, President Shahabuddin said in a televised address late on Monday.\n\nHe also said that it was \"unanimously decided\" to immediately release the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairperson and Hasina's nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia, who was convicted in a graft case in 2018 but moved to a hospital a year later as her health deteriorated. She has denied the charges against her.\n\nA BNP spokesperson said on Monday that Zia, 78, was in hospital and \"will clear all charges legally and come out soon\".\n\nHasina, 76, had ruled since winning a decades-long power struggle with Zia in 2009.\n\nThe Indian Express newspaper reported that Hasina was taken to a \"safe house\" after her arrival at Hindon and she was likely to travel to the United Kingdom. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.\n\n(Reporting by Ruma Paul in Dhaka, Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai and Kanjyik Ghosh in Bengaluru; Writing by Shivam Patel; Editing by Raju

Thousands were also injured in violence as the protests metamorphosed into nationwide anti-government rallies that continued even after the controversial quotas privileging certain groups were removed.\n\nAt least 109 people were killed during violent unrest on Monday alone, police and doctors said, updating an earlier toll.\n\nSchools, which were closed from mid-July amid the growing protests, reopened on Tuesday, though attendance was meager.\n\nHowever, the garment factories that form a mainstay of the South Asian country's economy were to remain closed until further notice, the main garment manufacturers association said.\n\nTwo Indian government officials have told Reuters news agency that Hasina landed at a military airfield at Hindon near Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka, two Indian government officials told.\n\nAlthough reports say she will remain in the neighboring country for the time being, a top-level source has said she wanted to \"transit\" on to London.\n\nHowever, as the British government has called for a UN-led investigation into \"unprecedented levels of violence\" during the official crackdown on the protests, she may find it unwise to go there.\n\nHasina is accused by critics anyway of overseeing the detention of tens of thousands of opposition activists during her rule, with hundreds falling victim to extrajudicial killings.\n\nHuman Rights Watch last year said security forces had committed \"over 600 enforced disappearances\" since Hasina came to power in 2009, and nearly 100 remain unaccounted for.\n\nHasina's departure is particularly good news for her archrival, Khaleda Zia, who was jailed on graft charges in 2018.\n\nPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin said on Monday that Zia would be released from prison along with the many people arrested during the protests.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The military wields significant political influence in Bangladesh, which has faced more than 20 coups or coup attempts since independence in 1971.\n\nBut Mr Islam, 26, made it clear that the students would not accept any government led by the army.\n\n\"Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted,\" he said.\n\nHe said the protesters would propose more names for the cabinet, and suggested that it would be difficult for those in power to ignore their wishes.\n\nBangladesh witnessed weeks of mass protests that left around 300 people dead, most of whom were students from colleges and universities. The protests began on July 1 over job quotas and soon escalated into a revolt against the rule of Ms Hasina who is now likely to head to the UK.\n\nMr Shahabuddin said in a televised address on Monday that an interim government would be formed soon after dissolving the parliament. The president also ordered the release of Begum Khaleda Zia, the former prime minister, from her house detention.\n\nMr Yunus has faced scrutiny from Ms Hasina's government since she returned to power in 2009. A longtime opponent of the ousted leader, Mr Yunus was accused of corruption and tried on charges that he said were politically motivated.\n\nIn January he was sentenced to six months in jail by a court for violating the labour laws but was granted bail in March.\n\nMidway through the protests, Mr Yunus had urged the international community to help end the violence in Bangladesh.\n\n\"I urgently call on world leaders and the United Nations to do everything within their powers to end the violence against those who are exercising their rights to protest,\" he said. \"There must be investigations into the killings that have taken place already.\"\n\nSanjida Islam Tuli, a human rights activist and co-ordinator of Mayer Dak, a missing people organisation, told The Telegraph: \"He [Yunus] is neutral. It's new Bangladesh and we expect him to align with the aspirations of youth and students of Bangladesh and put an end to the enforced disappearances and torture.\"\n\nAla Uddin, a professor of anthropology at University of Chittagong, said: \"The name of the student movement was Anti-Discrimination Student Movement, so there should be no discrimination at any level,\" Ala Uddin said.\n\n\"We want the spirit of liberation war to be fully materialised in society; where democracy, equality, and religious freedom will be guaranteed. Where there will be no discrimination in society; and there will be no religious or ethnic conflicts,\" he added.\n\nAt least 109 people have died in the violence, including 14 police officers, and hundreds of others injured, according to media reports, which could not be independently confirmed.\n\nIn the southwestern district of Satkhira, 596 prisoners and detainees escaped from a jail after an attack on the facility Monday evening, the United News of Bangladesh agency reported, as police stations and security officials were attacked across the country.\n\nThe main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party on Tuesday urged people to exercise restraint in what it said was a \"transitional moment on our democratic path\".\n\nTarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"It would defeat the spirit of the revolution that toppled the illegitimate and autocratic regime of Sheikh Hasina if people decide to take the law into their own hands without due process.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score":

But his ambitions were widely viewed as having sparked the ire of Hasina, who accused him of \"sucking blood from the poor\".\n\nCritics in Bangladesh and other countries, including neighbouring India, have also said microlenders charge excessive rates and make money out of the poor. But Mr Yunus said the rates were far lower than local interest rates in developing countries or the 300% or more that loan sharks sometimes demand.\n\nIn 2011, Ms Hasina's government removed him as head of Grameen Bank, saying that at 73, he had stayed on past the legal retirement age of 60. Thousands of Bangladeshis formed a human chain to protest his sacking.\n\nIn January this year, Mr Yunus was sentenced to six months in prison for violations of labour law. He and 13 others were also indicted by a Bangladesh court in June on charges of embezzlement of 252.2 million taka ($2 million) from the workers' welfare fund of a telecoms company he founded.\n\nAlthough he was not jailed in either case, Mr Yunus faces more than 100 other cases on graft and other charges. Mr Yunus denies any involvement and said, during an interview with Reuters, the accusations were \"very flimsy, made-up stories\".\n\n\"Bangladesh doesn't have any politics left,\" Mr Yunus said in June, criticising Ms Hasina. \"There's only one party which is active and occupies everything, does everything, gets to the elections in their way.\"\n\nHe told Indian broadcaster Times Now that Monday marked the \"second liberation day\" for Bangladesh after its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan following the exit of Ms Hasina.\n\nMr Yunus is currently in Paris undergoing a minor medical procedure, his spokesperson said, adding he has agreed to the request of students who led the campaign against Mr Hasina to be the chief adviser of the interim government.\n\nMr Yunus was an economist teaching at the University of Chittagong when famine struck Bangladesh in 1974, killing hundreds of thousands of people and leaving him searching for better ways to help his country's vast rural population.\n\nThat opportunity came when Mr Yunus came across a woman in a village near he university who had borrowed from a moneylender. The amount was less than a dollar but in return the moneylender gained the exclusive right to buy everything she produced at a price to be determined by the moneylender.\n\n\"This to me was a way of recruiting slave labour,\" Mr Yunus said in his Nobel acceptance speech. He found 42 people who had borrowed a combined $27 from the moneylender and lent them the funds himself - the success of that endeavour spurring him on to do more and think of credit as a basic human right.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n\"When I gave the loans I was astounded by the results I got.

Here's a look at who these key Bangladeshi leader are and what's their take towards ties with India.\n\nBangladesh is set to get a new government as the country's president dissolved parliament on Tuesday. The country's Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman took the responsibility for forming the interim government and reportedly held meetings with key political parties in the country.\n\nThe development came in the backdrop of Sheikh Hasina's resignation as the Bangladesh Prime Minister on Monday amid violent protests. Meanwhile, the dissolved Bangladesh parliament cleared the way for new elections to replace the longtime prime minister, Sheikh Hasina.\n\nAmid the political developments in the country, several key names, apart from that of the Army chief, have emerged. Here's a look at who these key Bangladeshi leader are and what's their take towards India:\n\n1. Khaleda Zia: Zia, the arch-rival of Hasina, is the former Bangladesh prime minister and the chief of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP). After Hasina's resignation, President Mohammed Shahabuddin also ordered Zia's release from house arrest. She was convicted on corruption charges by Hasina's government in 2018. She was officially released on Tuesday.\n\nZia served as the Bangladesh Prime Minister three times. She took over as the PM in 1991, becoming the first woman Prime Minister of Bangladesh. She became the prime minister for a second consecutive term in 1996. But she had to resign within a month. Zia was re-elected in 2001 and ruled till 2006.\n\nUnder Khaleda Zia's rule, Bangladesh is said to have a rocky relationship with India. During her tenure, India faced challenges related to cross-border terrorism. In its Annual Report 2004-2005, India had expressed concern over the activities of the terrorist groups operating from \"the territory of Bangladesh through diplomatic channels, as also in the bilateral meetings between India and Bangladesh.\"\n\n2. Muhammad Yunus: The name of Muhammad Yunus made headlines when he said he was \"hurt\" by India's response to the Bangladesh protest and violence. He told The Indian Express, \"When India says it's internal affairs, it hurts me. If there is a fire in the brother's house, how can I say it is an internal affair? Diplomacy has a much richer vocabulary than saying it is their internal affair.\"\n\nNobel Laureate Prof Dr Yunus, who is currently in Paris for the Olympics, has reportedly accepted the role of chief adviser for the interim government. The coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement demanded swift formation of interim government headed by Yunus, Dhaka Tribune reported.\n\nYunus is a Bangladeshi economist and Nobel laureate. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. He is the Founder of Grameen Bank. A longtime opponent of the ousted leader, Yunus was accused of corruption by her government and tried on charges he said were motivated by vengance.

Thousands were also injured in violence as the protests metamorphosed into nationwide anti-government rallies that continued even after the controversial quotas privileging certain groups were removed.\n\nAt least 109 people were killed during violent unrest on Monday alone, police and doctors said, updating an earlier toll.\n\nSchools, which were closed from mid-July amid the growing protests, reopened on Tuesday, though attendance was meager.\n\nHowever, the garment factories that form a mainstay of the South Asian country's economy were to remain closed until further notice, the main garment manufacturers association said.\n\nTwo Indian government officials have told Reuters news agency that Hasina landed at a military airfield at Hindon near Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka, two Indian government officials told.\n\nAlthough reports say she will remain in the neighboring country for the time being, a top-level source has said she wanted to \"transit\" on to London.\n\nHowever, as the British government has called for a UN-led investigation into \"unprecedented levels of violence\" during the official crackdown on the protests, she may find it unwise to go there.\n\nHasina is accused by critics anyway of overseeing the detention of tens of thousands of opposition activists during her rule, with hundreds falling victim to extrajudicial killings.\n\nHuman Rights Watch last year said security forces had committed \"over 600 enforced disappearances\" since Hasina came to power in 2009, and nearly 100 remain unaccounted for.\n\nHasina's departure is particularly good news for her archrival, Khaleda Zia, who was jailed on graft charges in 2018.\n\nPresident Shahabuddin said on Monday that Zia would be released from prison along with the many people arrested during the protests.\n\nHer actual release was then confirmed by her party on Tuesday, according to the AFP news agency.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news",

About 300 people were killed and thousands injured in violence that ripped through the country.\n\nGarment factories, which supply apparel to some of world's top brands and are a mainstay of the economy, will remain closed on Tuesday and plans to reopen will be announced later, the main garment manufacturers' association said.\n\nStudent leaders, who spearheaded a movement against job quotas that turned into a call for Ms Hasina to resign, said early on Tuesday that they want a new interim government with Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief adviser.\n\n\"Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted,\" Nahid Islam, one of the key organisers of the student movement, said in a video on Facebook with three other organisers. \"We wouldn't accept any army-supported or army-led government.\"\n\n\"We have also had discussions with Muhammad Yunus and he has agreed to take on this responsibility at our invitation,\" Islam added.\n\nMr Yunus (84) and his Grameen Bank won the 2006 Nobel Peace prize for work to lift millions out of poverty by granting tiny loans of under $100 (\u20ac91) to the rural poor of Bangladesh but he was indicted by a court in June on charges of embezzlement that he denied.\n\nReports said Mr Yunus is currently in Paris. He told Indian broadcaster Times Now in a recorded interview that Monday marked the \"second liberation day\" for Bangladesh after its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.\n\nBut he said Bangladeshis were angry with neighbour India for allowing Ms Hasina to land there after fleeing Dhaka. \"India is our best friend ... people are angry at India because you are supporting the person who destroyed our lives,\" Mr Yunus said.\n\nMs Hasina landed at a military airfield at Hindon near Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka, two Indian government officials told Reuters.\n\nBangladesh army chief Gen Waker-Uz-Zaman plans to meet the protest organisers at noon local time on Tuesday, the army said in a statement, a day after Gen Zaman announced Ms Hasina's resignation in a televised address and said an interim government would be formed.\n\nJubilant crowds stormed unopposed into the opulent grounds of Ms Hasina's residence after she fled, carrying out looted furniture and TVs. One man balanced a red velvet, gilt-edged chair on his head. Another held an armful of vases.\n\nGen Zaman said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Ms Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - to discuss the way ahead and was due to hold talks with the president, Mohammed Shahabuddin.\n\nAn interim government will hold elections as soon as possible after consulting all parties and stakeholders, Mr Shahabuddin said in a televised address late on Monday.\n\nHe also said that it was \"unanimously decided\" to immediately release the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) chairwoman and Ms Hasina's nemesis, Begum Khaleda Zia, who was convicted in a graft case in 2018 but moved to a hospital a year later as her health deteriorated. She has denied the charges against her.\n\nA BNP spokesperson said on Monday that Ms Zia (78) was in hospital and \"will clear all charges legally and come out soon\".\n\nMs Hasina (76) had ruled since winning a decades-long power struggle with Ms Zia in 2009.\n\nThe Indian Express newspaper reported that Ms Hasina was taken to a \"safe house\" after her arrival at Hindon and she was likely to travel to the United Kingdom. - Reuters", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The decision was taken following meetings with the heads of defence forces, leaders of political parties, student leaders and some civil society representatives, the presidential statement said.\n\nHasina's flight on Monday ended her 15-year second stint in power. She had ruled the country for 20 of the last 30 years, having inherited the political movement of her father, state founder Mujubur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1975.\n\nGeneral Waker-Uz-Zaman, the army chief, was due to meet student leaders to discuss the formation of an interim government that is expected to hold elections soon after it takes over.\n\nWhat happens next after Hasina, who turned Bangladesh into an economic success and ruled with an iron fist, remains unclear. It is possible the interim government will exclude her Awami League party, which won almost 80% of the parliamentary seats in a boycotted vote in January.\n\nWhile Shahabuddin has vowed to hold elections \"as soon as possible\", it's unclear if Hasina's allies will be able to participate or return to power.\n\nSome normalcy returned to the capital Dhaka, although traffic was lighter than usual and few schools reopened with thin attendance after closing down in mid-July as protests against quotas in government jobs morphed into a broad campaign against Hasina's rule.\n\nAbout 300 people were killed and thousands injured in the violence that ripped through the country.\n\nBut more trouble loomed as the Bangladesh Police Association on Tuesday said its members were going on strike, a day after the protests they had sought to crush with deadly force toppled the prime minister.\n\n\"Until the security of every member of the police is secured, we are declaring a strike,\" the association, which represents thousands of police officers, said in a statement, which also offered an apology for police actions against the protesters.\n\nStudent leaders, who spearheaded the movement for Hasina to resign, said they want Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus as the chief adviser to the interim government and a spokesperson for Yunus said he has agreed to their demand.\n\nYunus, 84, and his Grameen Bank won the 2006 Nobel Peace prize for work to lift millions out of poverty by granting tiny loans of under $100 to the rural poor of Bangladesh, but he was indicted by a court in June on charges of embezzlement that he denied.\n\nYunus is currently in Paris for a \"minor medical procedure\" but was planning to return to Bangladesh \"immediately\" afterward, a spokesperson said.\n\nHasina, 76, landed at a military airfield, Hindon, near Delhi on Monday after leaving Dhaka, two Indian government officials told Reuters, adding that India's National Security Adviser Ajit Doval met her there.

The student movement cited the emergency, including indiscriminate firing, attacks on temples and widespread looting, as the reason for announcing the proposal earlier than expected.\n\nThe anti-quota stir, which started roughly a month ago, slowly transformed into anti-government demonstrations. On Monday, the protesters, defying the nationwide curfew, stormed the Prime Minister's home and declared a win for the people of Bangladesh.\n\nHere are some facts about Muhammad Yunus:\n\n1. Muhammad Yunus was born in 1940 in Chittagong, a seaport city in Bangladesh. He pursued his early education at Dhaka University in Bangladesh. Later, he received a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University in the United States, where he earned his PhD in economics in 1969.\n\n2. After obtaining his PhD, Mr Yunus became an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University. In the mid-1970s, he returned to Bangladesh and took up the position of head of the economics department at Chittagong University. At the time, Mr Yunus started providing small personal loans to destitute basket weavers, and the idea later inspired him to establish the Grameen Bank in 1983.\n\n3. The bank focused on providing tiny loans (as small as Rs 2000) to women in rural Bangladesh to start small businesses - poultry farming, weaving or selling goods. The loans were offered without collateral, and repayment was based on trust and peer pressure. This approach helped millions lift themselves out of poverty, earning Mr Yunus the nickname \"Banker to the Poor\". The Grameen Bank model has since been replicated in over 100 countries worldwide.\n\n4. Throughout his life, Mr Yunus received numerous international awards and held several significant positions. From 1993 to 1995, he was a member of the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women, appointed by the UN Secretary-General. He also served on the Global Commission of Women's Health, the Advisory Council for Sustainable Economic Development, and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance. Notable awards during this period include the Independence Day Award (1987), Bangladesh's highest award; the World Food Prize (1994); and the King Hussein Humanitarian Leadership Award (2000). In 2006, the Nobel Committee jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank for their groundbreaking work in microfinance and economic empowerment in the country.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n5. In June 2024, Muhammad Yunus was indicted by a Bangladesh court on charges of corruption and embezzlement of 252.2 million taka (Rs 219.4 crore) from the workers' welfare fund of his telecoms company, Grameen Telecom. Grameen Telecom owns a 34.2 per cent stake in Grameenphone, the country's largest mobile phone company. Mr Yunus and 13 others were accused of misappropriating funds and engaging in money laundering. The 83-year-old denied any wrongdoing and claimed the charges were politically motivated. In January, he was also sentenced to six months in prison for labour law violations but got out on bail.\n\nOver the last month, since the beginning of the anti-quota protests primarily led by students, at least 300 people lost their lives after authorities took action against demonstrators across Bangladesh. The protesters argued that the government's job reservation policy for freedom fighters' families favoured the Awami League members. They demanded a merit-based system, instead.", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank",

They were also accused of money laundering.\n\nSpecial Judge Syed Arafat Hossain dismissed petitions seeking the charges to be dropped, saying the prosecution had preliminarily demonstrated the misappropriation of funds and the illegal money transfers abroad.\n\nIn another case, Yunus was sentenced to six months in prison in January for violations of labour law, which he denied.\n\nAlthough he is not in prison after securing bail in that case, Yunus faces more than 100 cases regarding the violations and graft accusations, which he had said in an interview with Reuters was \"very flimsy, made-up stories\".\n\nIn an August 28, 2023 letter, where signatories raised concerns about Yunus \"targeted by what we believe to be continuous judicial harassment,\" Sheikh Hasina responded by saying she would welcome international experts and lawyers to come to Bangladesh to assess the legal proceedings.\n\nThe allegations against Yunus included pursuing aggressive methods in collecting loans with a high interest rate to diverting funds and not following norms.\n\nIn 2010, a Danish documentary made allegations against Yunus and the Grameen Bank of diverting funds worth about $100 million given to the Bank by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD). The allegations were subsequently disproved.\n\nHasina had called Yunus a \"bloodsucker\" and accused him of using force and other means to recover loans from poor rural women as head of Grameen Bank.\n\nAfter reviewing his activities in 2011, Yunus was removed as the bank's managing director for allegedly violating government retirement regulations on beyond the age of 60.\n\nIn an interview to Harvard Business Review, Yunus said this \"fundamentally damaged the very essence of Grameen Bank. With this change, the government has practically taken over management, and this will set in motion the end of the Bank.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Yunus was put on trial in 2013 on charges of receiving money without government permission, including his Nobel Prize award and royalties from a book. He later faced other charges involving other companies he created, including Grameen Telecom, which is part of the country's largest mobile phone company, GrameenPhone. Yunus and 13 others were named in a case brought by the Anti-Corruption Commission in a related matter.\n\nIn 2015, Yunus was summoned by Bangladesh's revenue authorities over non-payment of taxes amounting to $1.51 million.\n\nYunus is a distinguished social entrepreneur, banker, economist and civil society leader. He was born on June 28, 1940 in Chittagong in Bangladesh, and studied at Dhaka University. Later, he received a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University.\n\nAccording to the website nobelprize.org, Yunus received his Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt in 1969, and in the next year he became an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University. He rose to international fame when in 2006 he received Nobel Prize for his pioneer work in microcredit and microfinance.\n\nThe Grameen Bank, set up by Yunus in Bangladesh in 1983, provided small loans to underserved entrepreneurs, empowering them to achieve social and economic development despite limited access to traditional banking services.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1995, Yunus was a member of the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women. He has served on the Global Commission of Women's Health, the Advisory Council for Sustainable Economic Development, and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance.\n\nHe had floated a political party in 2007 named 'Nagarik Shakti', but ruled out any possibility of contesting elections.\n\nYunus served as a Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland from 2012 to 2018 and was previously a professor of economics at Chittagong University.

However, considering the emergency situation, we are announcing it now,\" Nahid said.\n\nNahid also said the interim government would be formed in which internationally renowned Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus, \"who has wide acceptability, would be the chief adviser\".\n\nBangladesh Army Chief Waker-Uz-Zaman is scheduled to meet the protest leaders at 12 pm on Tuesday.\n\nYunus told a news channel that there was a critical need to restore law and order in Bangladesh, warning of potential spillover effects into neighbouring countries, including India. He stated, \"If you destabilise Bangladesh, it will spill over all around, including Myanmar and the seven sisters in West Bengal.\" He warned of a \"volcanic eruption\" that could impact the region, especially with a million Rohingyas already in the country.\n\nYunus is a distinguished social entrepreneur, banker, economist and civil society leader. He was born on June 28, 1940 in Chittagong in Bangladesh, and studied at Dhaka University. Later, he received a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University.\n\nAccording to the website nobelprize.org, Yunus received his Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt in 1969, and in the next year he became an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University. He rose to international fame when in 2006 he received Nobel Prize for his pioneer work in microcredit and microfinance.\n\nThe Grameen Bank, set up by Yunus in Bangladesh in 1983, provided small loans to underserved entrepreneurs, empowering them to achieve social and economic development despite limited access to traditional banking services.\n\nFrom 1993 to 1995, Yunus was a member of the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women. He has served on the Global Commission of Women's Health, the Advisory Council for Sustainable Economic Development, and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance.\n\nYunus is the recipient of numerous international awards for his ideas and endeavors, including the Mohamed Shabdeen Award for Science (1993), Sri Lanka; Humanitarian Award (1993), CARE, USA; World Food Prize (1994), World Food Prize Foundation, USA; lndependence Day Award (1987), Bangladesh's highest award; King Hussein Humanitarian Leadership Award (2000), King Hussien Foundation, Jordan; Volvo Environment Prize (2003), Volvo Environment Prize Foundation, Sweden; Nikkei Asia Prize for Regional Growth (2004), Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan; Franklin D. Roosevelt Freedom Award (2006), Roosevelt Institute of The Netherlands; and the Seoul Peace Prize (2006), Seoul Peace Prize Cultural Foundation, Seoul, Korea. He is a member of the board of the United Nations Foundation.\n\nHe had floated a political party in 2007 named 'Nagarik Shakti', but ruled out any possibility of contesting elections.\n\nYunus served as a Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland from 2012 to 2018 and was previously a professor of economics at Chittagong University. He was a board member of the United Nations Foundation from 1998 to 2021.\n\nIn January 2024, Yunus was sentenced to six months in jail by a court on a labour law case decried by his supporters as \"politically motivated\". He was also jailed in a $2.3 million embezzlement case. The embezzlement case involves workers welfare fund of Grameen Telecom, which owns 34.2% of the country's largest phone company, Grameenphone, a subsidiary of Norway's telecom giant Telenor.\n\nThe charges involve the embezzlement of over 250 million takas and money laundering.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Most of the dead suffered bullet wounds, it added.\n\nLast month, students launched protests against discrimination in public job recruitment, which put renewed pressure on the government after a court reinstated controversial quotas for government jobs.\n\nWith the latest casualties, the death toll rose to at least 478 from July 16 until Aug. 5, including 100 on Sunday, according to local media reports.

Waker-uz-Zaman.\n\nThe decision came after leaders of opposition parties including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and Jamaat-e-Islami party met Shahabuddin for talks.\n\nZia, the chairperson of the BNP and a two-term prime minister of Bangladesh (1991-1996 and 2001-2006), has been under arrest since 2018.\n\nIt added that all those detained during mass student protests will be released, while Zaman has pledged to investigate the deaths of protesters in recent days.\n\nShahabuddin later also addressed the nation, saying the families of the victims of the student movement will be compensated and the injured will be given the necessary assistance for medical treatment.\n\nHe also called on the political parties to restore law and order in the country and to stop looting and destructive activities.\n\n\"I am directing the armed forces to take strict action to protect the lives and property of the people and state assets,\" he added.\n\nA statement from the military said that all offices and schools will open starting Tuesday after weeks of violent demonstrations.\n\nEarlier, student movement leaders blasted Hasina over alleged violations of human rights during her 15 years in power.\n\n\"We will bring Hasina to justice even if she has fled the country,\" key protest coordinator Nahid Islam told a reporter in the capital Dhaka.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr",

The residences and business establishments of ministers, party MPs and leaders of Hasina's Awami League government were also attacked in Dhaka and outside Dhaka.\n\nThe Army chief Gen Waker Uz Zaman has taken over the reins of the country and issued a statement that an interm government will be formed for the smooth running of the nation.\n\nAgencies", "source": {"uri": "muscatdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Muscat Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nisha_joshi@muscatdaily.com", "name": "Nisha Joshi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Star_(Bangladesh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Star (Bangladesh)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Bangladesh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Bangladesh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaleda_Zia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Khaleda Zia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microcredit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.muscatdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Muscat-Daily-17.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793245", "eventUri": "eng-9793245", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

His efforts earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006. In a recent video message, coordinators Nahid Islam, Asif Mahmud, and Abu Bakar Mazumdar outlined their proposal for Yunus to lead the interim government, highlighting his longstanding commitment to social and economic development.\n\nBorn in Chittagong in 1940, Yunus studied at Dhaka University before receiving a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University. He earned his Ph.D. in economics in 1969 and subsequently taught at Middle Tennessee State University before returning to Bangladesh. At Chittagong University, he led the economics department and engaged in several international advisory roles, including with the Fourth World Conference on Women and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance.\n\nYunus's contributions have been recognized globally, earning him numerous awards such as the World Food Prize (1994) and the Volvo Environment Prize (2003). Despite his accolades, Yunus has expressed reluctance toward a political career, having previously dismissed political aspirations in favor of focusing on social work. In 2007, he founded a political party, Nagarik Shakti, but later distanced himself from electoral politics, stating, \"I am not a politician, I am not fit for that kind of job.\"\n\nRecently, Yunus faced a legal challenge when a court sentenced him to six months in jail in January 2024 on charges related to labor law violations during his tenure with Grameen Telecom. This sentence was criticized by his supporters as politically motivated. The Labour Court imposed a fine and allowed Yunus to appeal the decision, which has been temporarily stayed.\n\nAs Bangladesh navigates this period of transition, Dr. Yunus's potential leadership of the interim government is a subject of significant public interest and debate.", "source": {"uri": "mmnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "MM NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microcredit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grameen Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chittagong", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Chittagong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Dhaka", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Dhaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Tennessee_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle Tennessee State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanderbilt_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanderbilt University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulbright Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo_Environment_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volvo Environment Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Telecom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grameen Telecom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Food_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Food Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Liberalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://mmnews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Dr-Yunus1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793245", "eventUri": "eng-9793245", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

However, he has shared a frosty relationship with Hasina, who once accused him of \"sucking blood\" from the poor. Under Hasina's rule, Yunus was booked in more than 200 cases -- including forgery, money laundering, and embezzlement.\n\nHere's a look at who Yunus is, what his system of microfinance is, why he shared a frosty relationship with Hasina, and what are the cases against him.\n\nWho is Muhammad Yunus?\n\nAs Bangladesh struggled to stabilise its economy and tackle poverty in the post-independence years, Yunus came up with a unique idea: microcredit, or small loans without collateral to entrepreneurs who wouldn't normally qualify for bank loans, on terms that were suitable to them.\n\nThe success of a local experiment convinced Yunus that the model could be scaled up -- and in 1983, his flagship initiative, Grameen Bank, was launched. The bank is widely considered to be a great success -- it has disbursed collateral-free loans adding up to more than $34 billion among close to 10 million people since its inception, with a recovery rate of more than 97%, the Bangladeshi newspaper Daily Sun reported last year.\n\nBanks based on Grameen Bank's microcredit model now operate in more than 100 countries around the world. In 2006, Yunus and Grameen Bank were awarded the Peace Nobel \"for their efforts to create economic and social development from below\". Yunus came to be known as the \"Banker to the Poor\".\n\nWhat was the reason for his friction with Hasina?\n\nSoon after winning the Nobel, Yunus began to flirt with the idea of forming his own political party. This didn't sit well with Hasina, who was in jail at the time, facing charges of extortion.\n\nYunus subsequently abandoned his plans, saying there wasn't enough support for his new political movement. Nonetheless, once Hasina returned to power in 2009, her government opened a host of investigations into Yunus' activities. The former Prime Minister accused him of using force and other means to recover loans from poor rural women as head of Grameen Bank.\n\nWhat are the cases against Yunus?\n\nMost recently, in January this year, Yunus and three other officials at his telecommunications company, Grameen Telecom, were sentenced to six months in prison for violating Bangladesh's labour laws. They were immediately granted bail.\n\nIn 2015, he was summoned by Bangladesh's revenue authorities over alleged non-payment of taxes amounting to $1.51 million.\n\nTwo years before that, he was put on trial for allegedly receiving money without government permission, including his Nobel Prize award and royalties from a book.\n\nIn 2011, Yunus was removed as managing director of Grameen Bank for allegedly violating government retirement regulations.\n\nThe criminal cases against Yunus triggered concern globally. In August last year, 160 international figures, including former US President Barack Obama and former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, signed a letter denouncing the \"continuous judicial harassment\" of Yunus.\n\nSignatories of the letter, including more than 100 Nobel laureates, said they feared for \"his safety and freedom\".", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "explained_desk@indianexpress.com", "name": "Explained Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microfinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grameen Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microcredit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banker_to_the_Poor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Banker to the Poor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collateral (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Telecom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grameen Telecom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ban_Ki-moon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ban Ki-moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Nobel_Prize_in_Chemistry", "label": "dmoz/Science/Chemistry/Nobel Prize in Chemistry", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/Muhammad-Yunus-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793245", "eventUri": "eng-9793245", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The student leaders announced their preference for Yunus in a video released early Tuesday morning. Nahid Islam -- a key figure in the movement -- said, \"Any government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted. We wouldn't accept any army-supported or army-led government.\" Notably, Yunus has accepted to take on the role.\n\nBorn on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong, Bangladesh, Yunus pursued higher education in the United States on a Fulbright scholarship. After earning a PhD in Economics, he returned to Bangladesh shortly after its independence from Pakistan in 1971. He served as the head of the Economics Department at Chittagong University and was deeply affected by the severe poverty and famine plaguing his nation.\n\nAccording to reports, Yunus's concern for his nation led him to experiment with providing small loans to impoverished individuals who lacked access to traditional banking services. This initiative resulted in the establishment of Grameen Bank in 1983, which offered microloans to help people invest in small businesses and improve their living conditions. The bank's innovative model has been replicated globally as a powerful tool for poverty alleviation.\n\nIn 2006, Yunus and Grameen Bank were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to create economic and social development from below. Despite his global acclaim, Yunus has faced significant challenges in his home country. His relationship with ousted PM Hasina has been contentious, with the leader publicly criticizing Yunus's microfinance practices. In 2011, he was removed from his position as the managing director of Grameen Bank on grounds of exceeding the legal retirement age.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Peace_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Peace Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chittagong", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Chittagong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partition of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extreme poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulbright_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fulbright Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittagong", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chittagong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcredit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microcredit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grameen Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_reduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poverty reduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microfinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social change"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Education and Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l53220240806143248.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793245", "eventUri": "eng-9793245", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Yunus, the internationally esteemed 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner, also said that students singularly ousted her.\n\n\"It's a celebration all over Bangladesh as she has left, students made it happen,\" Yunus, who is in Paris, working as an advisor with the Olympics organisers, said while speaking to CNN-News18.\n\nHe said that the deaths of student protesters was a 'failure of democracy'. \"This is a failure of democracy. The paramilitary and the army were brought in. The accumulated anger spilled over like a volcanic eruption,\" he said.\n\nSheikh Hasina's 15-year rule as Bangladesh's prime minister ended Monday as she fled more than a month of deadly protests and the military announced it would form an interim government.\n\nThe protests against her began with protesters demanding an overhaul of the job quota system but due to clashes that killed scores during the initial protests, new protests began last week demanding justice for those who died during the clashes.\n\nThe protesters have accused the police and Hasina's party of coming together to attack and kill the protesters.\n\nThe latest violence took the total number of people killed since protests began to at least 366.\n\nYunus said that the protests restarted because of 'utterances made' and killings. He also said that the vandalisation was expected. \"There is nothing wrong with that. They are expressing their anger,\" he said.\n\nHe also accused Hasina of rigging the elections held earlier this year. Hasina ruled Bangladesh from 2009 and won her fourth consecutive election in January after a vote without genuine opposition.\n\nYunus, who was pegged to be a rival of Sheikh Hasina, was indicted in a corruption case in June where the government prosecutors accused him and 13 others of embezzling $2.1 million (252 million Bangladeshi taka) from Grameen Telecom, one of several firms he founded.\n\n\"She made me more popular and in the process she hurt herself,\" Yunus said.\n\nHe was also among those who called for a caretaker government to be set up until the elections are concluded. \"Having a caretaker government and a caretaker government taking care of elections was the cure. But Sheikh Hasina never let that happen,\" he said.\n\n\"I would like to return to Bangladesh but I stay away from politics,\" he said.\n\nHe expressed his disappointment over the way the Bangladesh government treated him. \"They have a street named after me in Paris because of what I have done,\" he said.\n\nHe said that some people in Bangladesh felt that India was against them, referring to the election results, which some in Bangladesh claim were not properly conducted due to absence of an opposition.\n\n\"Bangladeshi people felt that India is against us, against Bangladesh,\" Yunus said and added that she should not have been congratulated after the election results were declared.\n\nHe said that it is possible that Bangladesh's relationship with neighbours like China and Pakistan could be impacted by the protests with respect to its strategic outlook. \"It's possible (that) they will come,\" he said.\n\nHe said the 'beauty of democracy' is such that Awami League could script a comeback but said that protesters had a right to express their opinions. \"Awami league can always come back, that's the beauty of democracy... Everyone has the right to express their opinion as long as they follow rule and law. You have to accept democracy... there is no escape from that,\" he said.\n\nThe Nobel laureate said that people are not in favour of a military rule but did not offer his views on how a Bangladesh under the Awami League-rival Bangladesh National Party (BNP).\n\n\"It's a question of how they present themselves to a new Bangladesh.

Nahid Islam, Asif Mahmud, and Abu Bakr Mazumdar at 4:40 am (Bangladesh time) on August 6 through a video statement.\n\nThe student leaders stated that after 24 hours of deliberation, they have outlined this interim government due to the urgent situation. Dr. Yunus has agreed to take on this role, responding to the student community's call. The students also urged President Mohammad Shahabuddin to quickly establish this interim government and promised to reveal the names of additional members by morning, seeking to see the government formation process completed promptly.\n\nThe Nobel laureate, on August 5, hailed Bangladesh's newfound freedom following Sheikh Hasina's resignation and flight from the country. Yunus, who spoke to ThePrint, described the nation as \"liberated\" from what he called Hasina's dictatorial rule. He criticised Hasina for undermining the legacy of her father, 'Bangabandhu' Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and portrayed her regime as oppressive and controlling.\n\nYunus, renowned for his work in microfinance which has helped lift many out of poverty, also accused Hasina of sabotaging her father's legacy. Despite being targeted with over 190 legal cases by Hasina's Awami League government, Yunus maintained his stance, reflecting on the significant political shift in Bangladesh.\n\nSheikh Hasina's 15-year tenure as Bangladesh's Prime Minister came to a dramatic end on August 5 as she fled the country amidst severe unrest. The military has announced the formation of an interim government following a violent weekend that resulted in nearly 100 deaths.\n\nThe unrest, which began with protests over job quotas and escalated into widespread calls for Hasina's resignation, reached a tipping point with violent clashes on August 4. General Waker-Uz-Zaman, the chief of Bangladesh's army, declared Hasina's resignation in a national broadcast and stated that the military would establish a caretaker government to restore order.\n\nOn August 5, Dhaka saw chaotic scenes, with crowds storming Hasina's official residence, looting, and even setting fire to symbols of her administration. At least 66 more deaths were reported as gangs targeted allies of Hasina's Awami League party, and revenge attacks were launched across the city.\n\nThe violence extended to other government buildings and police stations. Mobs ransacked and torched property associated with Hasina's rule, including media outlets, statues of her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and a museum dedicated to him. Protesters expressed their discontent, with some calling Hasina's ousting a form of liberation.\n\nBangladesh's President Mohammed Shahabuddin has ordered the release of those detained during the protests, including former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. The interim government's formation was announced late Monday, though it remains unclear whether General Waker will lead it.\n\nHasina, aged 76, reportedly left Bangladesh by helicopter and is believed to have landed at a military airbase near New Delhi. There were earlier plans for her to transit to London, though this is uncertain due to a UN-led investigation into the violence.\n\nInternational reactions have called for a peaceful and democratic transition. The United States and the European Union have urged restraint and the need for an orderly transition, while the UN Secretary-General has called for a thorough investigation into the violence.\n\nThe unrest, which initially began as student-led protests against job quotas, has resulted in at least 366 deaths since it started. The military's response has been characterized by restraint compared to past crackdowns, but many police officers have been targeted in the recent violence.\n\nBangladesh has a history of military interventions, with the last major one occurring in 2007.

He will serve as the chief adviser to the interim government, according to the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement. Yunus has faced controversy, including indictment on charges of embezzling $2 million from Grameen Telecom's workers' welfare fund and accusations of money laundering.Banker to the Poor\n\nThis reminds everyone of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus who established the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh in 1983. And the man is back again, this time to rebuild the nation as Bangladesh continues to boil.\n\nYunus will be the chief adviser to the interim government, the coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement announced.\n\nNahid Islam, one of the key coordinators of the movement, said that Prof Yunus has agreed to take on this crucial responsibility at the call of the student community to save the country, the Daily Star newspaper reported.\n\nYunus was also marred in the controversy when he was indicted by a Bangladesh court on charges of embezzlement of 252.2 million taka ($2 million) from the workers' welfare fund of Grameen Telecom, which owns a 34.2% stake in Grameenphone, the country's largest mobile phone company and a subsidiary of Norway's telecom giant Telenor. Yunus and others were also accused of money laundering.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize 2006 was awarded jointly to Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank \"for their efforts to create economic and social development from below.\"\n\nHe believed that credit is a fundamental human right. His objective was to help poor people escape from poverty by providing loans on terms suitable to them and by teaching them a few sound financial principles so they could help themselves.\n\nFrom Yunus' personal loan of small amounts of money to destitute basketweavers in Bangladesh in the mid-70s, the Grameen Bank advanced to the forefront of a burgeoning world movement toward eradicating poverty through microlending.\n\nReplicas of the Grameen Bank model can be found in more than 100 countries worldwide.\n\nMuhammad Yunus, born in 1940 in Chittagong, Bangladesh, studied at Dhaka University and later received a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University. He earned his Ph.D. in economics in 1969 from Vanderbilt and then became an assistant professor at Middle Tennessee State University before returning to Bangladesh to lead the economics department at Chittagong University. Yunus has contributed to various international organizations and received numerous awards for his work.\n\nYunus began his higher education journey at Dhaka University in Bangladesh. He then moved to the United States on a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1969. The following year, he joined Middle Tennessee State University as an assistant professor of economics.\n\nAfter his stint in the United States, Yunus returned to Bangladesh and took the role of head of the economics department at Chittagong University. He significantly contributed to multiple international bodies, including his role from 1993 to 1995 as a member of the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women, appointed by the UN secretary general.\n\nYunus has also been involved with the Global Commission of Women's Health, the Advisory Council for Sustainable Economic Development, and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance.

The 84-year-old Yunus is arguably the most famous Bangladeshi internationally. The economist is the founder of Grameen Bank, a micro-finance bank established in 1983.\n\nBangladesh has been pushed into a state of uncertainty after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned from her post and fled to India, following protests by several student groups. Hasina, who has been in power in Bangladesh since 2009, gave in to the pressure from the Army, which gave her an ultimatum to step down following the months-long protests that have left over 300 protesters dead.\n\nCREDIT: REUTERS\n\nBangladesh Army Chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman on Monday announced the resignation of PM Hasina and said that he was \"taking full responsibility\" for the country. He also mentioned that an interim government would be taking over, without specifying whether and what role the military will be playing in the new administration.\n\nAlso read: Astrologer goes viral for predicting Sheikh Hasina's political crisis in 2023\n\nCREDIT: PTI\n\nAs discussions about the interim government gain momentum, a familiar name has resurfaced.

In 2006, he and a group of prominent civil society activists came together with the aim of cleaning up politics. He even wrote an open letter seeking public opinion on forming a political party.\n\nCREDIT: AP\n\nWhile he indeed ended up announcing a political party called Nagorik Shakti in 2007, it was short-lived, and within months, Yunus pulled the plug on his political career.\n\nAlso read: The Indian Major Who Saved Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina's Family In 1971 War Meets Her Again\n\nHowever, the damage was already done, and the Bangladesh government slowly but steadily started interfering in matters related to Grameen Bank.\n\nCREDIT: AP\n\nThis culminated in Yunus facing a probe over alleged misappropriation of funds and his eventual ouster from the Grameen Bank.

However, considering the emergency situation, we are announcing it now,\" Nahid said, referring to the indiscriminate firing and attacks on temples and widespread looting in various places.\n\n\"We have decided that the interim government would be formed in which internationally renowned Nobel Laureate Dr Mohammad Yunus, who has wide acceptability, would be the chief adviser,\" Nahid announced.\n\n\"We want to see the process rolling by the morning.

We have given our blood, been martyred, and we have to fulfil our pledge to build a new Bangladesh.\n\n\"No government other than the one proposed by the students will be accepted. As we have said, no military government, or one backed by the military, or a government of fascists, will be accepted,\" Nahid said.\n\n\"Soon after our uprising, the fascists are creating anarchy in the country. There is now firing and shooting going on in many areas, attacks on temples, looting and sabotage. We think it is a preplanned attempt to foil the students' uprising.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize in Literature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(fencing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foil (fencing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabotage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabotage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martyr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/images/2024/07/06/yunus.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793245", "eventUri": "eng-9793245", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

I wanted to do something immediate to help people around me.\"\n\nAfter years of experimenting with ways to provide credit for people too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans, he founded Grameen Bank in 1983.\n\nThe institution now has more than nine million clients on its books, according to its most recent annual report (2020), and more than 97 percent of its borrowers are women.\n\nYunus

A meeting was held at his residence that was attended by the chiefs of the country's Army, Navy, and Air Force, as well as political party leaders and civil society members.\n\nIn speculation that has emerged (inevitably so) since Mrs Hasina quit, three key names are at the forefront, two of whom are the Army, which took charge after Mrs Hasina quit, and which may have given her a 45-minute ultimatum; and her nemesis and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who was jailed in 2018 on corruption charges and whose release was ordered by the President.\n\nWho Is Khaleda Zia\n\nIn 1991 Mrs Zia, now 78 and unwell, became Bangladesh's first woman Prime Minister.\n\nShe won a second term in 1996 but the elections were boycotted and denounced as unfair by the major opposition parties, including Sheikh Hasina's Awami League. Her second term lasted 12 days; a caretaker government was installed and fresh elections were held, which Mrs Hasina won.\n\nMrs Zia returned to power five years later.\n\nREAD | Who Is Khaleda Zia, Jailed Ex-PM To Be Freed Amid Turmoil\n\nIn 2007 she was arrested on corruption charges. She was convicted and jailed in 2018, but multiple health concerns meant she has spent most of the time since in a hospital.\n\nIt is unclear if she will be well enough to assume the Prime Minister's post, should she be selected.\n\nThe third is Mr Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for founding the Grameen Bank, a microfinance organisation working towards community development in Bangladesh.\n\nMr Yunus is widely seen as protesting students' pick - a bid to ensure the focus of their agitation does not get ignored as Sheikh Hasina's rivals scramble to pick up power following her resignation.\n\nWho Is Md Yunus\n\nAn economist with a PhD from Vanderbilt University - a private research institution in Tennessee in the United States - Mr Yunus taught there briefly before returning to Bangladesh to head the department at Chittagong University.\n\nHe set up the Grameen Bank in 1983. The bank provides tiny loans (as small as Rs 2,000) to women in rural Bangladesh to start small businesses. This helped millions lift themselves out of poverty, earning him the nickname 'banker to the poor'. The model is now replicated in over 100 countries.\n\nREAD | Unstable Bangladesh Can Lead To \"Volcanic Eruption\", Says Nobel Laureate\n\nHowever, in June he was indicted on charges of corruption and embezzlement of 252.2 million taka (Rs 219.4 crore) from the workers' welfare fund of his telecoms company, Grameen Telecom.\n\nThe 83-year-old has denied wrongdoing and claimed the charges are politically motivated. In January, he was also sentenced to six months in prison for labour law violations but secured bail.\n\nREAD | Who Is Md Yunus, Possible Advisor Of Interim Bangladesh Government\n\nAlso in the fray is Tariq Rahman, the exiled Chairperson of Mrs Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party.\n\nAs in the case of Khaleda Zia, there is no formal confirmation Mr Rahman will be party of any new government, but there is strong speculation to suggest Mrs Zia and her BNP could make a return.\n\nMr Rahman is widely expected to return to Bangladesh, at least according to news agency ANI, which quoted BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir to that effect.\n\nA potential fifth figure is Nahid Islam, a Dhaka University student seen as the protest leader.\n\nWho Is Nahid Islam\n\nMr Islam, a Sociology student, served as a National Coordinator for the 'Students Against Discrimination' Movement, which demanded reforms to the quota system for government jobs.\n\nIn the flurry of announcements and statements made last night Mr Islam claimed an outline for the interim government would be revealed within 24 hours.\n\nMr Nahid has been vocal against Sheikh Hasina's party, calling them \"terrorists\" on the roads.\n\nIn July he was abducted by at least 25 men in plain clothes from a house in Sabujbagh.\n\nREAD | Who Is Nahid Islam, Student Leader Of Protests Against Sheikh Hasina\n\nHe was blindfolded, handcuffed and tortured during repeated interrogations about his involvement in the protests. Two days later, he was found unconscious and battered under a bridge in Purbachal.\n\nHe was kidnapped a second time a week later by individuals claiming to be from intelligence agencies, including the Dhaka Metropolitan Police's Detective Branch. But the police denied involvement.\n\nSheikh Hasina Resignation\n\nMrs Hasina, 76, a five-time PM and daughter of the country's founding father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman - quit and fled Dhaka Monday evening after weeks of violent protests over a government jobs quota.\n\nShortly after Ms Hasina resigned, Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said the military will form an \"interim government\" and urged to protesters to stand down.\n\nOver 400 people have died in clashes between authorities and mobs for and against the scheme assuring 30 per cent quota to family members of Bangladesh's 1971 war with Pakistan.\n\nThe protests that have roiled Bangladesh were sparked by Mrs Hasina's government announcing a 30 per cent quota for family members of her country's 1971 war of independence against Pakistan.\n\nREAD | India's Diplomatic Problem In Dhaka Power Shift, Sheikh Hasina's Ouster\n\nThe students' movement gathered pace after the Bangladesh Supreme Court reinstated the quota, after first slashing it to five per cent. The students have alleged the quota is discriminatory.\n\nMrs Hasina left Dhaka in a military aircraft and flew to India's Hindon Air Force Base in Uttar Pradesh's Ghaziabad; she is expected to fly to London to claim political asylum.\n\nMrs Hasina was met on arrival by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. There is no word yet if Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet her.\n\nREAD | \"Want To Give Her Time,\" S Jaishankar Told MPs On Sheikh Hasina: Sources\n\nMr Modi has been briefed and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar today chaired an all-party meeting to discuss the Bangladesh issue. He briefed all parties about steps being taken by the government to address potential security, economic, and diplomatic repercussions.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nIndia's Border Security Force is on high alert across the country's 4,096 km border with Bangladesh, with field commanders ordered to take \"on ground\" positions and be prepared for anything.

Nobel-winning microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus has been asked by Bangladeshi protest leaders to helm an interim government to replace ousted premier Sheikh Hasina, who had hounded him in speeches and through the courts.\n\nThe 84-year-old, known as the \"banker to the poorest of the poor\", was awarded the Peace Prize in 2006 for his work loaning small cash sums to rural women, allowing them to invest in farm tools or business equipment and boost their earnings.\n\nGrameen Bank, the microfinance lender he founded, was lauded for helping unleash breakneck economic growth in Bangladesh, and its work has since been copied by scores of developing countries.\n\n\"Human beings are not born to suffer the misery of hunger and poverty,\" Mr Yunus said during his Nobel lecture, daring his audience to imagine a world where deprivation was confined to history museums.\n\nBut his public profile in Bangladesh earned him the hostility of Ms Hasina, who once accused him of \"sucking blood\" from the poor.\n\nBefore her hurried resignation and departure from Bangladesh on Aug 5, Ms Hasina's 15-year tenure was characterised by a growing intolerance of dissent, and Mr Yunus' popularity marked him as a potential rival.\n\nIn 2007, Mr Yunus announced plans to set up his own \"Citizen Power\" party to end Bangladesh's confrontational political culture, which has been punctuated by instability and periods of military rule.\n\nHe abandoned those ambitions within months, but the enmity aroused by his challenge to the ruling elite has persisted.\n\nMr Yunus was hit with more than 100 criminal cases and a smear campaign by a state-led Islamic agency that accused him of promoting homosexuality.\n\nThe government unceremoniously forced him out of Grameen Bank in 2011 - a decision fought by Mr Yunus but upheld by Bangladesh's top court.\n\nIn January he and three colleagues from one of the companies he founded were sentenced to jail terms of six months - but immediately bailed pending appeal - by a Dhaka labour court which found they had illegally failed to create a workers' welfare fund.\n\nAll four had denied the charges and, with courts accused of rubber-stamping decisions by Ms Hasina's government, the case was criticised as politically motivated by watchdogs including Amnesty International.\n\nStudent leaders whose protest campaign culminated in Ms Hasina's ouster on Aug 5 were expected to meet with the military to demand Mr Yunus lead a caretaker government.\n\nMr Yunus has not commented on the call for him to lead but he said in an interview with India's The Print that Bangladesh had been \"an occupied country\" under Ms Hasina.\n\n\"Today all the people of Bangladesh feel liberated,\" it quoted him as saying.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microfinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grameen Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nobel Prize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martial law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amnesty International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homosexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/08/06/FILES-BANGLADESH-POLITICS-UNREST-YUNUS-084820.jpg?VersionId=UDuaaoJejJg87HHtI472cRrChtAnU5lB", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793245", "eventUri": "eng-9793245", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1067, "textEnd": 1072, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Police and the security forces with which protesters have clashed in recent weeks were absent -- even traffic police were a rare sight in the capital, meaning those who left their homes were ensnared in gridlock.\n\nOthers were fearful to venture out after the violence that has rocked the country. Even as the army chief, Gen. Waker-Uz-Zaman, called for calm, 99 people were killed in clashes on Monday and Tuesday, according to a Washington Post tally following interviews with seven hospital authorities and doctors across Bangladesh -- bringing the death toll to at least 400 on both sides in the past month.\n\nWaker-Uz-Zaman announced Monday that the army would work with political parties and President Mohammed Shahabuddin to form a new interim government. But Nahid Islam, the coordinator of the protests, said in a video message on social media late Monday that the student demonstrators would not \"accept any army-supported or army-led government.\"\n\nHe urged Shahabuddin to quickly form an interim government led by Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist and banker known for pioneering microlending, which many see as helping lift the country out of poverty. Islam said the student leaders had spoken to Yunus, who agreed to head the temporary regime.\n\n\"We're all rejoicing -- the monster who is on top of us has left. Today we are free,\" Yunus said by phone from Paris on Monday night, adding that he would return to Bangladesh as soon as possible.\n\n\"A new force has emerged: the young people,\" Yunus said, adding, \"This is a kind of volcanic eruption.\"\n\nShahabuddin dissolved Parliament on Tuesday afternoon, effectively annulling the outcome of controversial elections this year. News of the president's decision came minutes after the 3 p.m. deadline for the dissolution demanded by protesters earlier in the day and paves the way for the formation of an interim government.\n\nWeeks of bloody clashes between protesters and security forces have left Bangladesh in turmoil, culminating in the storming of Hasina's residence and the burning of government offices Monday. Local media reported that Hasina escaped minutes before protesters entered her residence, leaving on a helicopter to India with her younger sister, Sheikh Rehana, in a dramatic end to her 15 years at the country's helm.\n\n\"The million-dollar question today is what ultimately led to her downfall,\" said Shafqat Munir, a research fellow at the Bangladesh Institute of Peace and Security Studies. \"What we do know is that the military made it clear that they will stand with the people and they will not fire on the protesters. That might have precipitated the whole chain of events.\"\n\nOn Sunday evening, the students called for a mass march to Dhaka the next day. Authorities shut down the internet and implemented a curfew Monday but were unable to control the people flooding into the capital, which local media reported to be in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nHasina, the country's longest-serving prime minister and the world's longest-serving female leader until her ouster, attempted to tell state agencies to crack down further on the protesters violating curfew and vandalizing property, including armored vehicles, according to local media.\n\nBut even after her top officials said the situation could no longer be handled by force, Hasina was persuaded to resign only after speaking to her son and sister, the reports said. Hasina landed in Delhi on Monday night, Indian media reported.\n\nThe protests that have gripped Bangladesh over the past month started in opposition to a government policy that reserves half of civil service jobs for certain groups, but they evolved into a broad-based opposition movement against Hasina, who has become increasingly authoritarian, rights groups and security analysts say.\n\nSince taking office in 2009, she has been accused of manipulating the country's elections -- including by suing and jailing political opponents -- to maintain her grip on power. Hasina's Awami League and its allies won an election this year that the United States said was neither free nor fair and that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the main opposition, boycotted.\n\nOn Monday night, Shahabuddin ordered the release of Khaleda Zia -- former prime minister and chairperson of the BNP. Many of the student protesters have been released, he said Tuesday.\n\n\"We want to see the Bangladeshi people decide the future of the Bangladeshi government,\" U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters Monday during a daily briefing.\n\n\"All decisions regarding the interim government should be made with respect to democratic principles, rule of law, and the will of the Bangladeshi people.\"\n\nMany experts said they had anticipated Monday's seismic events. \"All the preconditions were there,\" said Thomas Kean, a Bangladesh expert at the International Crisis Group nonprofit. \"It just wasn't clear where the spark would come from.\"\n\nOpposition politicians called for an interim government to be formed on the basis of strong engagement with the student protesters. \"They are the architects of this movement,\" said Zonayed Saki, a member of the Ganosamhati Andolan progressive political party who attended a meeting Monday evening headed by the army chief with several other parties. The students \"are showing a new path forward for Bangladeshi people,\" he said.\n\nWhile jubilation over Hasina's ouster continued into Tuesday, some observers warned that there was a long road ahead before Bangladeshi politics could be said to have a truly fresh start -- including major reforms of institutions that can hold the prime minister accountable.\n\n\"Our politicians forgot the invincibility and power of youth. The ruling regime created their own Frankenstein,\" said Iftekhar Zaman, executive director of Transparency International Bangladesh, which aided students in the recent protests. \"But whether this fall of the regime will translate into a genuine victory with the spirit and content of the student movement remains to be seen.\"\n\nMehrotra and Gupta reported from New Delhi and Tan from Taipei, Taiwan.

Following weeks of deadly protests, Bangladesh's 76-year-old Prime Minister left the country, raising this important question. Following Hasina's resignation, Bangladesh's Army Chief of Staff, Waker-Uz-Zaman, ruled out a military takeover and announced the formation of an interim civilian government.\n\nTo determine the makeup of the interim administration, he will make a call to President Mohammed Shahabudin of the nation tonight. Muhammad Yunus, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, is rumoured to be leading a transitional administration until the next general elections. The other names making the rounds are Sara Hossain, a well-known lawyer, Jahngir Alam Chowdhury, a retired three-star general of the Bangladesh Army, and Salehuddin Ahmed, a former governor of the Bangladesh Bank.\n\nMuhammad Yunus, a social entrepreneur, banker, economist, and leader of civil society from Bangladesh, was born on June 28, 1940. He founded the Grameen Bank and invented the ideas of microcredit and microfinance, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.Entrepreneurs who are too impoverished to be eligible for conventional bank loans are given these loans. Together, Yunus and Grameen Bank received the Nobel Peace Prize \"for their efforts to create economic and social development from below through microcredit.\"\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee stated that \"lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty\" as well as that \"across cultures and civilisations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the poorest of the poor can work to bring about their own development\" .Yunus has won numerous other awards on a national and international level. In 2009, he was awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, and in 2010, he was given the\n\nCongressional Gold Medal.\n\nIn February 2011, Yunus co-founded Yunus Social Business - Global Initiatives (YSB) with Saskia Bruysten, Sophie Eisenmann, and Hans Reitz. YSB establishes and equips social entrepreneurs to tackle global social issues. YSB serves as the global implementation arm of Yunus's vision of a new, humane capitalism. It advises corporations, governments, foundations, and non-governmental organisations while also managing funds intended to support social businesses in developing nations.\n\nHe was appointed Chancellor of Scotland's Glasgow Caledonian University in 2012, and he served in that capacity until 2018.He previously taught economics at Bangladesh's Chittagong University [4][5].[6] In relation to his work in finance, he published multiple books. He is a founding board member of the microcredit advocacy organisations Grameen America and Grameen Foundation.\n\nFrom 1998 to 2021, Yunus also served as a member of the board of directors of the United Nations Foundation, a public charity that supports UN causes.", "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She was behaving like an occupation force, a dictator, a general, controlling everything. Today all the people of Bangladesh feel liberated.\"\n\nYunus was convicted by the Hasina-led government in January for violating the country's labour laws and is currently out on bail.\n\nThe Nobel Laureate said this is like a second liberation for the people of Bangladesh and there is celebration all over the country. \"They are feeling the sense of liberation and joy that we can start all over again....We wanted to do it in the first round when we became independent in 1971. And we missed it because of all the problems we have right now. We now want to make a fresh start and create a beautiful country for ourselves. That's the commitment we make and students and young people will be leading our future,\" he said.\n\nAsked about vandalism by protesters, who tried to damage a statue of Mujibur Rehman in Dhaka and stormed the parliament building, Yunus said that it's an expression of the \"damage she (Hasina) has done\".\n\n\"It says what they feel about Hasina, what she did to herself and her father... it's not the fault of the young people who are doing this,\" he said.\n\nYunus, founder of the pioneering microfinance system that lifted millions of poor out of poverty in Bangladesh, ruled out any role in active politics. \"I'm not the kind of person who would like to be in politics. Politics is not my cup of tea,\" he maintained.\n\nCurrently in Paris, he said he would soon return to Bangladesh and continue to work for the people the way he did earlier.\n\n\"I will continue with my work in a more free environment that I didn't have during the regime of Sheikh Hasina because she was always attacking me. I will continue, devote myself to the things I could not do before,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, coming down heavily on the Hasina-led government, Yunus had in a separate interview with ThePrint demanded that she resign immediately.\n\n\"People are being killed by our own soldiers, our own police. They don't feel good about it at all, but they are being ordered to do something and kill people... what kind of government you have, which decides to kill its own people instead of protecting people's lives,\" he had told ThePrint.\n\nAsked what led to massive civil unrest in the country, he said, \"A very simple thing, you took away their (people's) right to vote. All the anger that they accumulated could not be expressed in any political way. So that came out as a simple demand for quota changes. It immediately caught up because the government behaved the same way, attacking them rather than listening to them because they are not in a listening mood at all. Only one person in the country decides everything. Her word is the law.\"\n\nExplaining the state of affairs, he also said that Hasina decided the fate of every election held in Bangladesh. \"That became unbearable. Now, people have the opportunity to express that and you cannot stop that anymore.\"\n\nAlso Read: How quota protests snowballed into movement that ended Sheikh Hasina's 15-yr rule in Bangladesh\n\nMuhammad Yunus on US, India\n\nAsked if the United States had any role in the transition of power, Yunus said, \"Usually people think about India playing a role in all this and people blame the US for not playing an active role in Bangladesh and always trying to do things there through India. People are very upset about that.\"\n\nHe added that unlike the US, India has played a \"major role\" as far as Bangladesh is concerned.\n\n\"I don't know what role they are playing now in this scenario and what role they will play in the upcoming situation,\" he told ThePrint.\n\nThe \"banker of the poor\" -- as Yunus is known internationally -- said he, however, believes that Bangladesh and India will continue to have good relations. \"How to shape it, how to design it, how to give mutual respect... those are things the next government, when it is elected, will decide and I am sure it will be a great friendship,\" he said.\n\nHe also said that he was disappointed with India's reaction to the civil unrest in Bangladesh.\n\n\"When it comes to student demonstrations, you said this is an internal affair. I said, well, your neighbour's house is burning and India is saying it is their internal affair. But when our elections are held, you rush to make sure that it is held according to their wishes and manipulate everything... all these elections took place because India was very eager to make the result according to their choice,\" Yunus said.\n\nMuhammad Yunus on role of Opposition\n\nThe Nobel Laureate said that with Hasina no longer calling the shots in Dhaka, things have changed in Bangladesh and he is not sure what role opposition parties including former PM Khaleda Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) will play in the current scenario.\n\n\"That's a question the new government will have to face.\"\n\nHe added that Hasina's party, the Awami League, too is not the same anymore.\n\n\"So what role they (opposition) will play in this disintegrated form, we don't know. The BNP never played any role because they never had a chance... they are not in Parliament. We don't know what is left of them, what they will do. The other parties are very minor parties. The Jamaat-e-Islami is banned,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the BNP was silent so far because they have been under attack all along. \"Now in a free country, how they emerge, how they decide their policies and actions, if there is an election, what role they will play in the elections, how they perform in the elections, is not very clear as of now.\"\n\nYunus also told ThePrint that once a general election is held, a lot of things will change.\n\n\"We don't need to speculate. We will go back to the people, they will be voting. They will decide, which party exists, which party will disappear, which party will become stronger than ever,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he also said he hopes to see a new political formation in the country. \"Young people should lead the way... they should be in charge of the country, not the older generation,\" he said.\n\nHis advice for the people of Bangladesh: be wary of past mistakes. \"Make sure we stay close to democratic principles and all the things it stands for... freedom of speech, rule of law, independence of judiciary and all the things we talk about. So we stick to that. As long as we stick to that you remain a strong country. We can be a beautiful country,\" he said.\n\n(Edited by Amrtansh Arora)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But his ambitions were widely viewed as having sparked the ire of Hasina, who accused him of \"sucking blood from the poor\".\n\nCritics in Bangladesh and other countries, including neighbouring India, have also said microlenders charge excessive rates and make money out of the poor. But Yunus said the rates were far lower than local interest rates in developing countries or the 300% or more that loan sharks sometimes demand.\n\nIn 2011, Hasina's government removed him as head of Grameen Bank, saying that at 73, he had stayed on past the legal retirement age of 60. Thousands of Bangladeshis formed a human chain to protest his sacking.\n\nIn January this year, Yunus was sentenced to six months in prison for violations of labour law. He and 13 others were also indicted by a Bangladesh court in June on charges of embezzlement of 252.2 million taka ($2 million) from the workers' welfare fund of a telecoms company he founded.\n\nAlthough he was not jailed in either case, Yunus faces more than 100 other cases on graft and other charges. Yunus denies any involvement and said, during an interview with Reuters, the accusations were \"very flimsy, made-up stories\".\n\n\"Bangladesh doesn't have any politics left,\" Yunus said in June, criticising Hasina. \"There's only one party which is active and occupies everything, does everything, gets to the elections in their way.\"\n\nHe told Indian broadcaster Times Now that Monday marked the \"second liberation day\" for Bangladesh after its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan following the exit of Hasina.\n\nYunus is currently in Paris undergoing a minor medical procedure, his spokesperson said, adding he has agreed to the request of students who led the campaign against Hasina to be the chief adviser of the interim government.\n\nYunus was an economist teaching at the University of Chittagong when famine struck Bangladesh in 1974, killing hundreds of thousands of people and leaving him searching for better ways to help his country's vast rural population.\n\nThat opportunity came when Yunus came across a woman in a village near he university who had borrowed from a moneylender. The amount was less than a dollar but in return the moneylender gained the exclusive right to buy everything she produced at a price to be determined by the moneylender.\n\n\"This to me was a way of recruiting slave labour,\" Yunus said in his Nobel acceptance speech. He found 42 people who had borrowed a combined $27 from the moneylender and lent them the funds himself - the success of that endeavour spurring him on to do more and think of credit as a basic human right.\n\n\"When I gave the loans I was astounded by the results I got. The poor paid the loans on time every time.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@theprint.in", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grameen America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grameen_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grameen Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Now", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Times Now"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_taka", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi taka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chittagong", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Chittagong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://static.theprint.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/theprint_default_image_new.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793245", "eventUri": "eng-9793245", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

After demonstrations turned violent on Sunday, and a sea of protesters descended upon the prime minister's official residence -- the Ganabhaban -- Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina announced her decision to resign and fled the nation, seeking safety in India.\n\nShortly after, Bangladesh's army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman addressed the nation, stating that an interim government would now run Bangladesh and called for calm. \"The country has suffered a lot, the economy has been hit, many people have been killed -- it is time to stop the violence,\" said Waker, dressed in military fatigues, shortly after jubilant crowds stormed and looted Ganabhaban, the Bangladesh prime minister's official residence.\n\nHe added that he would talk to the president to form the interim government and had held talks with the main opposition parties and civil society members -- but not Hasina's Awami League.\n\nThe question now arises: Who shall head this interim government? When will elections be held? For those who want answers, here's what we found out so far.\n\nForming an interim government\n\nAccording to media reports, General Waker-Uz-Zaman held consultations with leaders of some parties including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), Jatiya Party, Jamaat-e-Islami in the emerging situation. In the same meeting representatives of students and teachers were also present.\n\nLater, President Mohammed Sahabuddin, as per a report by Prothom Alo, also held a meeting with the chief of three services, political leaders, representatives of civil society and quota leaders aiming to form the interim government.\n\nPresident Mohammed Sahabuddin chaired the meeting where a condolence resolution was taken in memory of those killed in the anti-quota movement and prayers were sought for forgiveness and peace for their departed souls, said a press release. The meeting also decided to form an interim government soon.\n\nIt was after this meeting that it was announced that BNP chief Begum Khaleda Zia would be released immediately. Moreover, it was also announced that all prisoners detained for quota protests would be released.\n\nWho's who in the interim government\n\nIt is still unknown whether General Waker-Uz-Zaman would lead the interim government. However, as per reports, key organisers of the Anti-Discriminatory Student Movement -- who were in charge of the anti-quota protests that led to Hasina's ouster -- have proposed Nobel Laureate Dr Mohammad Yunus as the chief advisor of the interim government.\n\nAs per the Daily Star, Nahid Islam, one of the key coordinators of the movement, said they have already talked with Professor Yunus, and he has given his consent considering the present situation of the country.\n\nProfessor Yunus gained international prominence in 2006 when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance. A critic of Hasina and her administration, he was convicted by the Hasina-led government in January for violating the country's labour laws and is currently out on bail.\n\nSpeaking earlier about Hasina's resignation, he said: \"Bangladesh is liberated... We are a free country now.\"\n\n\"We were an occupied country as long as she (Hasina) was there. She was behaving like an occupation force, a dictator, a general, controlling everything. Today all the people of Bangladesh feel liberated.\"\n\nNotably, Yunus, according to a report in The Print, is currently in Paris. He told the media outlet that he would soon return to Bangladesh.\n\nBesides Yunus, the names of Dr Salimullah Khan and Md Nazrul Islam, also known as Dr Asif Nazrul, have been recommended to be part of the interim government. It is reported that the BNP floated the name of Dr Salimullah Khan to head the interim government.\n\nDr Khan is a prominent public intellectual known for his analysis of national and international politics and culture through Marxist and Lacanian theories. He is regarded as one of Bangladesh's leading intellectuals. He is known to make guest appearances on talk shows on domestic and global politics on Bangladeshi television networks.\n\nSimilarly, Dr Asif Nazrul is a Bangladeshi author, novelist, columnist, political analyst, and law professor at the University of Dhaka. Nazrul, who has written over 10 novels and non-fiction books, is well-known for his harsh critique of Bangladeshi politics. Nazrul currently teaches law at the University of Dhaka. He formerly worked for the Bangladeshi government as an administrative officer and writer.\n\nOther names proposed\n\nAccording to a News18 report, a total of 27 names have been proposed who shall be a part of the interim government in Bangladesh. Among these names, there is also General Iqbal Karim Bhuiyan (retired), who was the Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army from 2012-2015.\n\nNotably, General Bhuiyan was among the 48 retired army officers on Sunday (August 4) who had called on the government to withdraw the armed forces from the streets immediately. In a statement, he had read: \"Today we appeared here because we are deeply concerned, troubled and saddened by all the egregious killings, tortures, disappearances and mass arrests that have been tormenting Bangladesh over the past three weeks.\"\n\nOther notable names to be reportedly a part of the interim government are Justice Md Abdul Wahhab Miah (retired), the former Chief Justice of Bangladesh; Major General Syed Iftekhar Uddin (retired), former Inspector General of Prisons; Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya, economist and former Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Bangladesh to the WTO and UN Office in Geneva; Matiur Rahman Chowdhury, a journalist and editor-in-chief of the Manab Zamin, a Bengali tabloid; Brigadier General M Sakhawat Hossain (retired), former Election Commissioner of Bangladesh; Dr Hossain Zillur Rahman, economist and Bangladesh Rehabilitation Assistance Committee (BRAC) chairperson, and Justice M A Matin (retired), retired judge of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh.\n\nTough job ahead\n\nWhile Bangladesh's future remains uncertain as of now, one thing is certain; things are going to be tough for those in charge. As Irene Khan, a UN special rapporteur was quoted as telling Al Jazeera, \"There's a very tough job ahead.\"\n\nAl Jazeera's Tanvir Chowdhury agreed with this assessment, telling the media outlet that the message from the protesters is that whoever comes to power next \"will now know that they won't tolerate any kind of dictatorship or mismanagement and that the students will decide\".\n\nMeanwhile, foreign nations such as the US have said that the interim government in Bangladesh should be formed according to democratic principles, rule of law and the will of the Bangladeshi people. \"We want to see the Bangladeshi people decide the future of the Bangladeshi government,\" State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters at his daily news conference.\n\nThe UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also called for a \"peaceful, orderly and democratic transition\" as well as a \"full, independent, impartial and transparent investigation into all acts of violence,\" his spokesman Farhan Haq said.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I told them I have a lot of work to finish. But the students repeatedly requested me,\" a source of The Daily Star quoted him as saying.\n\nYunus, who had previously expressed his happiness over the anarchy that led to the ouster of Sheikh Hasina, added, \"If the students can sacrifice so much, if the people of the country can sacrifice so much, then I also have some responsibility.\"\n\nJournalist Sidhat Sibal informed on Monday that Yunus is all set to return to Bangladesh from France. The controversial Nobel laureate had hailed 5th August 2024 as 'Second Liberation Day.'\n\nIn January this year, a labour court in Dhaka found him guilty of violating the labour laws of Bangladesh. He was convicted, sentenced to 6 months of simple imprisonment and fined Tk 30000 (~$260).\n\nYunus and three other directors at 'Grameen Telecom' violated labour laws by failing to create a welfare fund for the workers in the company.\n\nThe labour court Judge, Sheikh Merina Sultana, noted that 67 Grameen Telecom employees were supposed to be made permanent in the company which did not happen.\n\nAs per the company's stated policy, it is supposed to share 5% of the dividends with the staff, which failed to materialise. Muhammad Yunus is currently facing 100 other charges for graft and labour law violations in Bangladesh.\n\nThe 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner founded Grameen Bank in 1983 to lend small loans to the poor. He was earlier fired as Managing Director of his bank for violating retirement regulations of the Bangladeshi government.\n\nYunus was also on trial for receiving money in 2013 for receiving money without government permission. He was infamously called a 'bloodsucker' by Sheikh Hasina for giving out loans to the poor at extremely high interest rates.\n\nHowever, nothing compares to the fact that he is an asset to the Western World, particularly the United States. In 2009, Muhammad Yunus was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by the then US President-turned-war criminal Barrack Obama.\n\nA year later, he was felicitated with the Congressional Gold Medal. He was also the recipient of the Fulbright Scholarship from the US State Department.\n\nWhen he was convicted in January this year, the United States came to his rescue and highlighted the 'global criticism' surrounding his sentencing by a labour court in Dhaka.\n\nMuhammad Yunus is the recipient of the Ramon Magsaysay Award, which was established by two CIA-linked American organisations in memory of a CIA groomed Philippines president.\n\nIt may be noted that the award was constituted by New York-based Rockefeller Brothers Fund. In 2000, Ramon Magsaysay Emergent Leadership Award was established by Ford Foundation, another American organisation.\n\nBoth these organisations are known for working for American interests in foreign countries, and have a history of closely working with the CIA. In fact, the Ford Foundation is alleged to be a philanthropic facade of the Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nIt is interesting to note that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi interviewed the controversial Muhammad Yunus in July 2020 during the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHe had raked up the issue of 'migrant workers' in a bid to internationalize the issue.\n\n\"We have people working for us, cooking food for us, security persons, darbaan for us, they are taking care of our children. We knew them. But suddenly we see millions of them on the highway trying to go home. Suddenly, all the city migrant workers are coming out of the city in a big crowd and going out. For a simple reason, they have nothing here, no life here, no money here to survive. So, ultimate place they can go back to is their home. So, desperately they are going home. And then on foot, thousand-mile journeys. That is the saddest part that Coronavirus has revealed,\" Yunus had said during the interview.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The announcement was made in a video released on Facebook early Tuesday.\n\nThe Bangladesh army chief Waker-Uz-Zaman is scheduled to meet with the protest leaders at 12 pm local time (0600 GMT) on Tuesday.\n\nWho is Muhammad Yunus?\n\nMuhammad Yunus, born on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong, Bangladesh, is a distinguished social entrepreneur, banker, economist, and civil society leader. He rose to international prominence in 2006 when he and the Grameen Bank received the Nobel Peace Prize for their pioneering work in microcredit and microfinance. These initiatives provide small loans to underserved entrepreneurs, empowering them to achieve economic and social development despite limited access to traditional banking services.\n\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, Yunus has been honored with numerous prestigious awards, including the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2010. He co-founded Yunus Social Business - Global Initiatives (YSB) in 2011, which focuses on promoting social businesses worldwide. YSB supports these enterprises through incubator funds and advisory services, working with various organizations such as companies, governments, foundations, and NGOs.\n\nYunus served as the Chancellor of Glasgow Caledonian University in Scotland from 2012 to 2018 and was previously a professor of economics at Chittagong University. He has also played a significant role in Grameen America and the Grameen Foundation, which continue his efforts in microcredit. From 1998 to 2021, he was a board member of the United Nations Foundation, contributing to a range of UN initiatives.\n\nProfessor Yunus has an extensive educational background, having studied at Dhaka University in Bangladesh before receiving a Fulbright scholarship to study economics at Vanderbilt University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1969. He began his academic career as an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University and later returned to Bangladesh to head the economics department at Chittagong University.\n\nThroughout his career, Yunus has held various influential positions, including serving on the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women (1993-1995), the Global Commission on Women's Health, and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance. His contributions have been recognized globally, with accolades such as the Mohamed Shabdeen Award for Science, the World Food Prize, the King Hussein Humanitarian Leadership Award, the Volvo Environment Prize, the Nikkei Asia Prize for Regional Growth, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Freedom Award, and the Seoul Peace Prize.\n\nIn response to the famine in Bangladesh in 1974, Yunus sought to make a tangible difference for the impoverished. He initiated long-term loans to help individuals start their own small businesses, which led to the establishment of the Grameen Bank and the broader movement of microfinance. This innovative approach has helped countless people escape poverty and improve their quality of life.\n\nYunus was sentenced to six months in jail by a court for violating the labour laws in this year's January but later in March he was granted bail.\n\nHe was also jailed in a USD 2.3 million embezzlement case. The embezzlement case involves a workers welfare fund of Grameen Telecom, which owns 34.2 per cent of the country's largest mobile phone company, Grameenphone, a subsidiary of Norway's telecom giant Telenor.\n\nThe charges involve the embezzlement of over 250 million takas and money laundering. The accused gave the money to trade union leaders instead of the workers. This way they deprived the ordinary workers of their rightful earnings.\n\nThe TOI News Desk comprises a dedicated and tireless team of journalists who operate around the clock to deliver the most current and comprehensive news and updates to the readers of The Times of India worldwide.

The residences and business establishments of ministers, party MPs and leaders of Hasina's Awami League government were also attacked in Dhaka and outside Dhaka.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled, with fresh elections planned\n\nBangladesh's army chief will meet student protest leaders on Tuesday as the country awaits the formation of a new government a day after Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled following a violent uprising against her.\n\nAt least 109 people were killed during the violent unrest on Monday, the deadliest day since protests began in early July, bringing the total number of deaths since mid-Jult to 409. Here are the latest updates on the Bangladesh crisis:\n\nThe situation in Dhaka was largely calm on Tuesday morning after a day of unrest and a night of tension. Buses and other public transport were on the streets and traders were opening shops. Government vehicles were heading to offices. Many battery-run rickshaws plied the roads, BDNews24.com newsportal said.\n\nThis comes a day after hundreds of people broke into her residence, vandalising and looting the interiors, providing dramatic expression to the anti-government protests. Hasina's residence Sudha Sadan and other establishments were attacked, vandalised and set on fire in the capital.\n\nOn Tuesday, the coordinators of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement announced that Nobel laureate Dr Muhammad Yunus will be the chief adviser to the interim government. In a video posted on social media, Nahid Islam, one of the key coordinators of the movement, said that Prof Yunus has agreed to take on this crucial responsibility at the call of the student community to save the country, the Daily Star newspaper reported.\n\n\"We took 24 hours to announce a framework for the interim government. However, considering the emergency situation, we are announcing it now,\" Nahid said. \"We have decided that the interim government would be formed in which internationally renowned Nobel Laureate Dr Mohammad Yunus, who has wide acceptability, would be the chief adviser,\" said Nahid, flanked by two other coordinators. His announcement comes hours after President Mohammed Shahabuddin said an interim government would be formed after dissolving the parliament as soon as possible.\n\nAccording to local media reports, 119 people have been killed in the violence and attacks on Hindu temples and widespread looting in the capital and various other places. Hundreds of people were killed in clashes in different parts of the country, including Dhaka, at the last moment of the one-point demand of the anti-discrimination student movement on Monday.\n\nEarlier, the Bengali language daily Prothom Alo reported the death of 98 people till 12 pm on Sunday. Another 16 deaths were reported in the middle of the night. The total death toll stood at 114 on Sunday. \"With this, the total death toll stood at 440 in 21 days from July 16 to yesterday,\" the paper said. It said that 37 bodies were brought to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital between 11 am and 8 pm on Monday. Citing hospital sources, it said 500 people were brought to the hospital with various injuries, including bullet injuries.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar briefed an All-Party meeting in Parliament about the ongoing developments in Bangladesh on Tuesday. \"Appreciate the unanimous support and understanding that was extended,\" he said in a post on social media platform X. Responding to Leader of Opposition (LoP) Rahul Gandhi while addressing an all-party meeting, Jaishankar said it was too early to say anything about foreign conspiracy. Jaishahkar, however, said, \"It is too early to rule in or rule out anything, but a Pakistani diplomat did change his social media profile picture to support the agitation in Bangladesh.\"\n\nJaishankar said Sheikh Hasina's presence in India is a courtesy move while the central government is closely monitoring the situation in Bangladesh. About her arrival in India, Jaishankar told the all-party meeting that for now it is being ensured that Hasina settles down, recovers and feels comfortable enough to discuss her plans. \"We want to give her space and time, she has come at short notice,\" he said at the meeting, adding that there is no decision yet on where she will go next.\n\nThe US, UK, and other global actors have for calm in Bangladesh. The United States called on all sides in Bangladesh to \"refrain from further violence\" as bullet-ridden bodies were strewn across hospital floors and looting swept the capital Dhaka. \"Too many lives have been lost over the course of the past several weeks, and we urge calm and restraint in the days ahead,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.\n\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has called for a full and independent UN-led investigation into the Bangladesh crisis following unprecedented violence and the loss of hundreds of lives over the past two weeks. Lammy urged all parties to collaborate to end the violence, restore calm, and prevent further casualties. Notably, Lammy did not mention Hasina, who fled to India and is reportedly seeking asylum in the United Kingdom.\n\nLate Monday night, President Shahabuddin asked all the political parties to normalise the law and order situation in the country and directed the armed forces to take stern measures to protect the lives and properties of the people and state assets. The educational institutions in the country were reopened on Tuesday following a long period of closure due to violence surrounding the student movement.\n\n\"The institution is open, and some girls have come, but attendance is low. Attendance will increase in a couple of days,\" Md Rahamot Ullah, principal of Kisholoy Girls' School and College in the Mohammadpur area of the capital, was quoted as saying by the paper. Trouble had been steadily escalating since the government's announcement of the quota system in June this year.\n\nBangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has announced that Tarique Rahman, the party's acting chairman, will be returning to the country very soon. \"You all know that our leader, Tarique Rahman, has been unjustly exiled abroad due to false cases. He has fully supported this movement, and we have taken steps to bring him back to the country immediately. Insha'Allah, we will be successful,\" the BNP leader was quoted as saying by The Dhaka Tribune.\n\n\"It has been decided that our leader Begum Khaleda Zia will be released immediately. Those who were imprisoned for political reasons will also be released. Now, in the current situation, all political parties, students, and the public will work together to control it.\" He said: \"We have achieved a great victory, a great success. To maintain this success, let's show restraint, not act out of anger or hatred, not attack anyone, and not damage any institutions. Especially, let's not attack our religious minority brothers.\"", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We are a free country now.\"\n\n\"We were an occupied country as long as she (Hasina) was there. She was behaving like an occupation force, a dictator, a general, controlling everything. Today all the people of Bangladesh feel liberated.\"\n\nYunus was convicted by the Hasina-led government in January for violating the country's labour laws and is currently out on bail.\n\nThe Nobel Laureate said this is like a second liberation for the people of Bangladesh and there is celebration all over the country. \"They are feeling the sense of liberation and joy that we can start all over again....We wanted to do it in the first round when we became independent in 1971. And we missed it because of all the problems we have right now. We now want to make a fresh start and create a beautiful country for ourselves. That's the commitment we make and students and young people will be leading our future,\" he said.\n\nAsked about vandalism by protesters, who tried to damage a statue of Mujibur Rahman in Dhaka and stormed the parliament building, Yunus said that it's an expression of the \"damage she (Hasina) has done\".\n\n\"It says what they feel about Hasina, what she did to herself and her father... it's not the fault of the young people who are doing this,\" he said.\n\nYunus, founder of the pioneering microfinance system that lifted millions of poor out of poverty in Bangladesh, ruled out any role in active politics. \"I'm not the kind of person who would like to be in politics. Politics is not my cup of tea,\" he maintained.\n\nCurrently in Paris, he said he would soon return to Bangladesh and continue to work for the people the way he did earlier.\n\n\"I will continue with my work in a more free environment that I didn't have during the regime of Sheikh Hasina because she was always attacking me.

That's why we're asking you to take responsibility,\" one of the students argued.\n\nYunus was quoted as saying: \"I also considered that these students had protested so much, they had to pay so much for it.\"\n\n\"If the students can sacrifice so much, if the people of the country can sacrifice so much, then I also have some responsibility. Then I told the students that I can take the responsibility,\" he said.\n\nYunus went to Paris as a special guest at the invitation of the Olympic Committee.

The people of Bangladesh forced her to resign as the country's active prime minister. Protesters marching on the streets were seen holding the 'Quit Hasina' banner and causing significant damage to property. As a result of these escalating riots, Hasina has now resigned and fled from Dhaka to New Delhi via Hindon Air Force station. This event marked an abrupt halt.\n\nMuhammad Yunus shares his views about the ongoing violence in Bangladesh \"Students dying, people dying -- that's not the kind of country we want to live in,\" Yunus remarked. He expressed his disappointment with the government's inability to protect its citizens, stating, \"This is not the way to live. The government is supposed to protect the people of the country. They should not be the killer.\"\n\nDespite the unrest, Yunus highlighted Bangladesh's economic potential: \"It is an amazing country; we are building up a new economy completely.\" He also mentioned his frequent visits to Bangladesh, saying, \"I appear in the country two times a month on two different charges,\" and added, \"I am here in Paris to attend the Olympics, but I live in Bangladesh and work in Bangladesh.\"\n\nYunus emphasized the importance of democratic principles, stating, \"Democracy needs transparent elections, freedom of speech, rule of law; it needs security for the citizens of its country. Unfortunately, these things do not exist at the moment.\" He stressed the need for fair elections, adding, \"Medicine to this problem is fair elections, and the people of the country should decide.\"\n\n\"We should talk about principles instead of the individual, we should have democracy, and the practice of democracy,\" Yunus noted, suggesting that fair elections are essential to resolving the country's issues.\n\nYunus addressed the growing influence of the West, stating, \"People should be interested in the politics of Bangladesh, and if you do not let them live their lives peacefully, then you should know that the violence will not only be limited within Bangladesh.\"\n\nYunus discussed the importance of learning from neighboring countries, mentioning Indian politician Mamata Banerjee's stance: \"Mamata Banerjee said they are welcome in India,\" noted Geeta Mohan. Yunus added, \"We should learn from each other, and I would like for Bangladesh to excel in democracy. We should be promoting that kind of direction, and it improves our relations with India.\"\n\nYunus clarified his position on entering politics: \"I have no such intention of being a politician. I am just a normal citizen.\" He explained his focus on smaller-scale efforts, saying, \"I want to help people in small segments and not on a national level.\" He also encouraged the involvement of younger generations in leadership roles, stating, \"We should encourage younger people to lead the country. I think they will do a much better job than us older generations.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Yunus expressed his hopes for Bangladesh: \"To have transparent elections and conduct fair elections.\" He emphasized the importance of youth leadership, saying, \"We want to be number one in terms of youth and leading the country.\" Additionally, he advocated for a focus on human values over profit maximization: \"Promote the idea of human value and avoid the idea of only focusing on profit maximization.\"\n\nAddressing the issue of nepotism, Yunus stated, \"Let's talk about what is right, and what is right is conducting fair elections which are transparent and not in any way threatening the citizens of their country.\" He concluded by highlighting his role in promoting Bangladesh globally: \"I tell people about Bangladesh, globally, and I feel I am free and very vocal in raising my concerns to world leaders.\"", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Yunus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamata_Banerjee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mamata Banerjee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_maximization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profit maximization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepotism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nepotism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/muhammad-yunus-051619432-16x9.jpg?VersionId=Qf.Ez6LeFCUbWKhB91_03bXThKam..Cb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793245", "eventUri": "eng-9793245", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The former Prime Minister was forced to flee the country amid the violent upheaval, leaving the nation in a state of uncertainty.\n\nOn Tuesday, following the resignation and flight of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina amid mounting anti-government unrest, the Students Against Discrimination group advocated for Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to become the chief adviser of Bangladesh's interim government.\n\nHowever, allegations of tax evasion continue to surround the newly proposed chief adviser. To provide clarity and insight into the situation, we are joined exclusively on NewsX by investigative Journalist Tom Heinemann and the host, Simran Babbar. He sheds light on the current issues and discusses the implications of this scenario for Bangladesh's neighbors.\n\nFirstly, the interview began with a question about the evidence of tax evasion collected against Muhammad Yunus through the deep investigation and findings.\n\nTom Heinman shared his insights on the matter, stating: \"We revealed documents that have never been published before, showing that Yunus was deliberately transferring money from one company to another and quoting himself for it due to tax reasons. But that's a long story. I think the video is online, and you can feel free to link to that so people can see for themselves. From my point of view, microcredit doesn't work; it's leaving poor people in a debt trap, creating a vicious cycle.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Sheikh Hasina's Son Reveals Former Bangladesh PM 'Did Want To Leave The Country' Amid Bangladesh Unrest\n\nFurther in the interview, it was asked: Given the current despair among the people of Bangladesh, can they accept a man who has been exposed for siphoning off $100 million?\n\nTo this, he opened up and replied, \"That's up to the people of Bangladesh to decide. What I can see and read is that this proposal about bringing Yunus into their interim government or leading the interim government is done by the student organization, and the student organization is certainly not the poor people. The students in the countryside still suffer from the vicious microcredit companies, not only the Grameen Bank but many others that, from my point of view, are very harsh on interest rates and very harsh in collecting reimbursements and whatever. If I should say something, I would stand with the poor people of Bangladesh. They don't have a voice. I gave them a voice in my film, and I hope also they will have a voice in the coming elections or whatever happens in Bangladesh's future.\"\n\nTowards the end of the discussion, it was asked: What concerns might observers and neighboring nations have for the people of Bangladesh if Muhammad Yunus is chosen as the successor now that Sheikh Hasina has departed?\n\nOn this, he elaborated on his views and said, \"He said to an Indian media outlet yesterday, or maybe this morning, that he's not really interested in politics. So, maybe that's part of the strategy -- saying that and then the people of Bangladesh might kindly ask him to join, and maybe he says yes to that. This is not my line of business, honestly speaking. I'm very critical of his banking models and microcredit, and I will continue to be because microcredit doesn't work as an alleviator of poverty. We have seen this in numerous studies all over the world, not only by Grameen Bank and Muhammad Yunus but basically all microcredit financial institutions. They are ripping off poor people with high interest rates that you wouldn't pay and I wouldn't pay, but the poor people have to pay because otherwise, they cannot get into the market.\"\n\nHe further added, 'Answering critical questions was not in his line of business. When it comes to the future of Bangladesh, I sincerely hope for peace. I hope that the Bangladeshi people will elect their new government themselves and not be pressured or harassed by anyone else. It's a big country with millions of voters; they should have their say and not be influenced by others.\n\nIn conclusion, Tom Heinemann's insights reveal deep skepticism about Muhammad Yunus's suitability as Bangladesh's chief adviser, given his past involvement in alleged tax evasion and the problematic impact of microcredit on the poor. He emphasizes the need for a government formed by the people of Bangladesh without external influence.

Here's what we know", "body": "Elections expected to be held as soon as possible but shape of future government uncertain over role of army, future of protesting students\n\nThe spectacular downfall of Sheikh Hasina after 15 years helming Bangladesh followed weeks of student protests which saw hundreds killed and chaos rip across the country.\n\nWhat started as a call for an end to a job quota system snowballed into a mass movement driven by young men and women demanding the 76-year-old leave office.\n\nThen on Monday afternoon, the once unthinkable happened, as one of Asia\u2019s longest-ruling leaders fled by helicopter, her abrupt exit stunning her supporters and critics alike.\n\nEuphoric protesters ransacked her residence and parliament building. But overnight jubilation spiralled into retribution, with reports of widespread looting and more deadly mob violence, some of it targeted at Hasina\u2019s Awami League supporters.\n\nA day after the end of Hasina\u2019s chokehold over Bangladesh, hard questions are now being asked over who will lead the interim government the army has said it wants to see established. Additionally, there is anxiety over whether unrest that is still rattling across a country suddenly freed from its once unassailable ruler can be swiftly and peacefully quelled.\n\nHere is an explainer of what may come next:Army and elections\n\nUncertain days lie ahead for Bangladesh.\n\nArmy chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman assumed control on Monday afternoon, vowing to swiftly help install an interim government. He called on the student-led protesters to go home, promising justice for the bloodshed over the recent weeks of political violence. Overnight, President Mohammed Shahabuddin promised elections would be held as soon as possible and ordered the release of jailed protesters as well as ex-prime minister, opposition figurehead and Hasina\u2019s nemesis: Khaleda Zia.\n\nTalks were due on Tuesday between the army chief and the students over the shape of what is to come \u2013 with the role of an army whose coups and attempted coups have pockmarked Bangladesh\u2019s short history since it came into being in 1971.\n\n\u201cThe students clearly say they don\u2019t want any military-backed government,\u201d Dr Mubashar Hasan, a human rights defender and researcher at the University of Oslo, told This Week in Asia. \u201cIt will be difficult for the military to hold power on the back of a movement of this scale.\u201d\n\nHow Bangladesh\u2019s youth \u2013 whose spilled blood and defiant protests shattered an authoritarian regime which seemed unbreakable just months ago as Hasina swept uncontested elections \u2013 will be included in the political settlement to follow is yet to be ascertained.\n\nYet student leaders are on the front foot, insisting early on Tuesday that they want a new interim government with Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus as its chief adviser.\n\n\u201cAny government other than the one we recommended would not be accepted,\u201d Nahid Islam, one of the key organisers of the student movement, said in a video on Facebook with three other organisers. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t accept any army-supported or army-led government.\u201dViolence, justice, retribution?\n\nWeeks of bloodshed have left hundreds dead, with student protesters alleging summary killings by security forces acting on Hasina\u2019s behalf \u2013 and reports of mob killings between pro and anti-government supporters across the country.\n\nA wave of looting overnight saw more than 100 more deaths, as well as arson attacks on buildings linked to Hasina\u2019s Awami League, prompting calls for calm from the international community. The United States called for all sides to \u201crefrain from violence\u201d.\n\n\u201cToo many lives have been lost over the course of the past several weeks, and we urge calm and restraint in the days ahead,\u201d said State Department spokesman Matthew Miller.\n\nExperts warn prolonged political violence could usurp the positive momentum of the student-led protests for real change.\n\nBut there were also early signs of the students seeking to get to grips with the situation by protecting sites belonging to religious minorities from mobs.\n\nThe student movement is also calling for justice for the recent bloody crackdown by state forces as well as harassment of dissidents, arbitrary jailings, beatings, extra judicial killings and other human rights abuses which mounted over Hasina\u2019s time in office. But that may prove convoluted in a country where Hasina\u2019s Awami League allies and appointees stack the army, police, judiciary and civil service, and managing expectations of movement which has claimed freedom may be integral to stability going forward.\n\nTarique Rahman, son of two-time prime minister Khaleda Zia and acting leader of the opposition-in-exile Bangladesh Nationalist Party, also called for \u201crestraint and calm in the midst of this transition moment in our democratic path\u201d.\n\nIn a post on X on Tuesday, he urged patience and those seeking justice to seek \u201clegal and legitimate steps\u201d against those who have wronged them.Who is Dr Yunus?\n\nThe garlanded microfinance pioneer Dr Muhammad Yunus has emerged as a potential key figure in stewarding the country towards new elections.\n\nThe 84-year-old was convicted under Hasina\u2019s watch of violating labour laws, in what his supporters say was a nakedly political attack on the popular Nobel Peace Prize winner, dubbed \u201cthe banker to the poor\u201d for his small loans through the Grameen Bank he founded. The students who toppled Hasina say they want Yunus to broker the uncertain next period before elections.\n\n\u201cDr Yunus has wide acceptability in Bangladesh but we will need to wait and see how this plays out,\u201d Hasan of the University of Oslo said. \u201cThere will be some reluctance in military ranks as many people were appointed by Sheikh Hasina.\u201d\n\nReports say Yunus is currently in Paris. He told Indian broadcaster Times Now in a recorded interview that Monday marked the \u201csecond liberation day\u201d for Bangladesh after its 1971 war of independence from Pakistan.\n\nBut he said Bangladeshis were angry with neighbour India for allowing Hasina to land there after fleeing Dhaka.\n\n\u201cIndia is our best friend \u2026 people are angry at India because you are supporting the person who destroyed our lives,\u201d Yunus said.\n\nSpeculation is mounting that Hasina will ultimately seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom.\n\nAdditional reporting by Reuters", "source": {"uri":

He rose to national fame in mid-July after police detained him and some other Dhaka University students as the protests turned deadly.\n\nNearly 300 people, many of them college and university students, were killed in weeks of violence across the country that only abated when Hasina resigned and fled to neighbouring India on Monday.\n\nIslam and other student leaders were due to meet army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman at noon (0600 GMT) on Tuesday.

Starting in the mid-1970s, just a few short years after returning to post-independence Bangladesh from the comfort of being a university teacher in the United States, he has painstakingly created dozens of organisations that have done a world of good: not only for Bangladesh, but for the world. Other leaders studied his models and adapted them in places as diverse as the Philippines, the United States, Kenya, and India. His influence on the thinking and work of a generation of traditional and social entrepreneurs is undeniable.\n\nOf course, he is best known for creating the Grameen Bank: first as a pilot project, and later as the world's first bank, serving the poor women with the majority owned by poor women. Today we take microfinance - the ability to provide financial products to the world's poor on a commercial basis for their and society's benefit -- as a given. But until Yunus showed how it could be done on a massive scale, the ideas on which modern microfinance rests appeared absurd. In this and other ways, he turned what was once unthinkable into something that is obvious and taken for granted. No amount of revisionist history can obscure his role in building Grameen Bank from day one into a world class institution that has shaped the global economy from the grassroots up. Grameen Bank under his leadership has successfully demonstrated that a microfinance Institution can be a viable business. This Is validated by the fact that the recovery rate of Grameen Bank was over 96%, even though their loans do not have collaterals as security.\n\nBut many people are unaware that his work has gone far beyond microfinance. Over the past two decades, he has designed a model for impact-first entrepreneurship that he calls \"social business\" and then created dozens of organisations that apply this approach to improving health care, education, the environment, and the positive role that sports can play in improving society.\n\nIncredibly, at age 84 he remains as productive as ever, travelling the world from his home in Bangladesh to inspire a new generation of young entrepreneurs to create their own social businesses and challenging corporate leaders to incorporate his model into aspects of their companies.\n\nIn today's troubled world, we need Yunus and his ideas more than ever. This is true in India, other major economies, and smaller, less developed countries and regions. Supporting Yunus in this mission is crucial, particularly in enabling him to use his influence, ideas, and energy for the common good, and therefore maximise the good he can do for people, institutions, governments, and academia. My ardent hope is that any free society that hopes to benefit from Yunus's extraordinary work, will allow him to continue his great work unencumbered.\n\nBusiness leaders often talk about how society can create an enabling environment for commercial activity. The same is true for social entrepreneurship. We must formulate an agenda in India and beyond that encourages social business, impact investment, social stock exchanges, and the like while also celebrating and supporting leaders like Yunus at the pinnacle of their creative powers and the kinds of idealistic entrepreneurs incubated and supported by organisations like Action for India that seek to build a thriving ecosystem for social entrepreneurship.\n\nOver the next two weeks, we will see the world coming together to celebrate the world's greatest athletes and what is possible when nations set aside differences and promote excellence under a defined set of rules. Yunus' influence on the Paris games will be on view for all to see.

From 1998 to 2021, he was a board member of the United Nations Foundation, contributing to a range of UN initiatives.\n\nProfessor Yunus boasts an extensive educational background, having studied at Dhaka University in Bangladesh before earning a Fulbright scholarship to pursue economics at Vanderbilt University, where he obtained his Ph.D. in 1969. He began his academic career as an assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University and later returned to Bangladesh to lead the economics department at Chittagong University.\n\nThroughout his career, Yunus has held numerous influential positions. He served on the International Advisory Group for the Fourth World Conference on Women (1993-1995), the Global Commission on Women's Health, and the UN Expert Group on Women and Finance.\n\nHis contributions have garnered global recognition, including the Mohamed Shabdeen Award for Science, the World Food Prize, the King Hussein Humanitarian Leadership Award, the Volvo Environment Prize, the Nikkei Asia Prize for Regional Growth, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Freedom Award, and the Seoul Peace Prize.\n\nIn response to the famine in Bangladesh in 1974, Yunus sought to make a tangible difference for the impoverished. He initiated long-term loans to help individuals start their small businesses, which led to the establishment of the Grameen Bank and the broader microfinance movement.

Court on Sunday cleared the way for the National Board of Revenue to claim Tk 663 crore as taxes from Grameen Kalyan, and firms of Nobel laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, in five income tax assessment years from 2012 to 2017.\n\nThe bench of Justice Muhammad Khurshid Alam Sarkar and Justice SM Maniruzzaman passed the order after disposing of a writ petition filed in 2017 by Grameen Kalyan's managing director Abul Kalam Mohammad Mohiuddin Chowdhury challenging the legality of the assessment with hearing the company's statement.\n\nThe court in the verdict asked Grameen Kalyan to pay the outstanding Tk 663 crore in installments.\n\nAppearing for Grameen Kalyan, lawyer Abdullah Al Mamun sought deferral of the verdict considering the students' ongoing violent movement, which turned into a one-point demand for resignation of prime minister Sheikh Hasina.\n\nMamun also refused to pay the dues in question in installments.\n\nThe court suggested Mamun to appeal to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court if he felt aggrieved by the verdict.\n\nGrameen Kalyan's another lawyer Sarder Jinnat Ali argued that the NBR's orders for reassessment of income tax from company, was illegal as it submitted its income tax time to time.\n\nThe NBR demanded fresh income tax from Yunus and his founded social business entities after reopening and re-assessment of the companies' tax files in 2017.\n\nYunus, also the chair of Grameen Telecom, has been facing more than 170 cases, most of which are related to alleged violation of rights of workers.\n\nHe was sentenced to six months' imprisonment by the Third Dhaka Labour Court on January 1 along with his three Grameen Telecom colleagues in a case filed by the Department of Inspection for Factories and

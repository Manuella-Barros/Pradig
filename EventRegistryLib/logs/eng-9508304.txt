They are out there somewhere ... I would not, could not and did not kill anyone.\"\n\nThe Goldman and Brown families subsequently pursued a wrongful death lawsuit against Simpson in civil court. In 1997, a jury in Santa Monica, California, found Simpson liable for the two deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5 million in damages.\n\nIt has since emerged that Simpson died without having paid a large portion of the civil judgment.

His family broke the news via social media. Taking to the former pro football star's official account on X (formerly Twitter), the Simpson Family wrote, \"On April 10th, our father, Orenthal James Simpson, succumbed to his battle with cancer. He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren. During this time of transition, his family asks that you please respect their wishes for privacy and grace.\"\n\nRELATED: Owners Of Ford Bronco Used In Infamous 1994 O.J.

However, he wouldn't name any names.\n\nWhoever snagged the role of McCann will join Station 19 star Boris Kodjoe, who is playing Simpson, and actress Charlotte Kirk, who is playing his ex-wife Nicole Brown.\n\nNewton said roughly 30 minutes of the movie has already been completed, a snippet of which can be seen in a teaser released Tuesday, April 23.\n\nIn the clip, Kodjoe can be seen strapped to an electric chair with sparks shooting off the sides of his head and smoke billowing from his mouth.\n\n\"Think of the real O.J.,\" Kodjoe says while stuttering. \"Not this lost person.\"\n\nThe teaser ends with a title card reading: \"Feel better now? You haven't seen anything yet.\"\n\nOriginally titled Nicole & O.J., the movie has been in development for years. Back in 2018, People released first-look photos of Kodjoe and Kirk as Simpson and Brown, respectively.\n\n\"Boris is the same height as O.J., very tall, a very athletic presence,\" producer Stephen Small told the outlet at the time. \"He transformed himself, changed his voice, he sounds pretty amazing.\"\n\nNewton is hoping to finish the movie by the end of this year for a release date in 2025.\n\nSimpson died of prostate cancer on April 10. He was 76 years old.\n\nIn October 1995, Simpson was acquitted of the murders of both Brown and Goldman. A civil lawsuit was subsequently filed by the Brown and Goldman families, which ultimately found Simpson liable.

Countless folks grew up idolizing the Hall of Famer and \"Naked Gun\" movie star in the '70s and '80s Simpson's legacy was forever tainted when he was arrested and charged for the murders of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman, in 1994.\n\nSimpson was acquitted of the murders in 1995, but he was later found liable for their deaths in a civil trial. Simpson was ordered to pay $33.5 million to the families of Brown and Goldman.\n\nBritish filmmaker Joshua Newton is directing a film called \"The Juice\" which will center around the relationship between OJ and Nicole. Charlotte Kirk has already been confirmed as the star portraying Nicole.\n\nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter, Newton revealed that \"Zoolander\" and \"Wedding Crashers\" star Owen Wilson turned down $12 million to portray real-life attorney Douglas McCann. According to Newton, the reason is that Wilson is not keen on playing in a controversial film that will depict Simpson as an innocent man:\n\n\"Owen Wilson was perfect for the role.

Simpson's Innocence", "body": "A satirical thriller is being made about O.J. Simpson's innocence, but you can't pay Owen Wilson enough to star in it.\n\nSummary O.J. Simpson's death hasn't changed anyone's mind about his perceived guilt despite being acquitted of murder. That is, except for a movie called The Juice . Filmmaker Joshua Newton struggled with casting for the film, initially targeting Owen Wilson for the lead role. Newton has overcome numerous hurdles in his filmmaking career, including technical and legal challenges in his previous work, Beautiful Blue Eyes .\n\nDisgraced NFL athlete, actor, and celebrity O.J. Simpson passed away on April 11, and in the two weeks since then, people have hardly eulogized the man rhapsodically. Most people agree that Simpson seemed guilty of murdering his wife, Nicole Brown, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, despite being acquitted 30 years ago. Simpson has even morbidly teased his guilt, whether it's in footage where he pretends to stab someone to death or it's his book If I Did It, where the word 'if' is practically hidden in the title formatting. However, there's one upcoming film that, like Alan Dershowitz, imagines Simpson as possibly innocent.\n\nThat would be The Juice (previously titled Nicole & O.J.), a strange project from a suitably eccentric filmmaker named Joshua Newton. Playing Simpson in The Juice is Boris Kodjoe, famous for Brown Sugar, Madea's Family Reunion, the Resident Evil films (playing Luther West), and shows like Soul Food, Station 19, and The Last Man on Earth. But the main character of the film is supposedly Douglas McCann, an attorney who represented O.J. Simpson in a civil case from 2000 and went down a conspiratorial rabbit hole believing that Simpson was innocent of the 1994 murders. Newton was passionate about casting one particular person for the role -- Owen Wilson.\n\nClose\n\n\"Owen Wilson was perfect for the role,\" Newton told the Hollywood Reporter. \"I actually had a meeting with him in Santa Monica. Everybody loved the script. His agent wanted him to do it. We offered him $12 million. But at the end of the lunch, Owen stood up and said, 'If you think I'm going to take the lead role in a movie about how O.J. didn't do it, you've got to be kidding me.'\"\n\nRelated Norm Macdonald Was Fired from SNL for O.J. Simpson Jokes, Conan O'Brien Praises His Courage Comedians like O'Brien, Neal Brennan, and Joe Rogan remember and praise Norm Macdonald for his relentless O.J. Simpson jokes.\n\nNewton, who has been trying to get The Juice made for over a decade, now believes he's found the right person for the part, but hasn't shared any casting details. Currently, the film has a webpage that invites people to submit information and answer an interesting question: What would justice look like? Here's what the webpage asks in a Google doc:\n\nIn the upcoming satirical thriller 'The Juice,' we explore various exaggerated ends for a notorious figure. What should justice have looked like? Let us know your most outrageous ideas, and they might just inspire what you see on screen in 2025!\n\nThe Juice Hasn't Been Joshua Newton's Only Difficult Production\n\nBefore The Juice (you can watch a teaser above), Newton actually directed Roy Scheider's final film, Beautiful Blue Eyes, which was based on Newton's father. Scheider (Jaws, All That Jazz) plays Joseph, a retired New York City cop who visits his estranged son in Germany and discovers that his son's neighbor is the Nazi officer who killed his family in Poland during the Holocaust. Joseph then enlists his son in a kidnapping attempt to make the former Nazi officer pay for his crimes. Unfortunately, the film had both technical and legal problems. As MovieWeb explained:\n\n\"Scheider finished filming his scenes for Beautiful Blue Eyes , however, technical issues had caused many scenes to need to be redone, and the actor had passed away before he could reshoot any scenes. As a result, the production had to wait until the technology was able to produce a workable facsimile of Scheider to complete the production.\"\n\nRelated An O.J. Simpson Documentary Became One of the Greatest Films of All Time The epic O.J.: Made in America transcends true crime to become a portrait of Simpson, America, policing, race, and so much more.\n\nAdditionally, there were legal issues that affected Beautiful Blue Eyes. A company behind the film ended up suing Variety for allegedly reneging on their six-figure contract to promote the film. Newton and others also sued Facebook for blocking the film from being promoted due to terms of service policies. On top of all that, the film was dragged into a messy and complicated \"legal maze\" (according to The Hollywood Reporter) between star Charlotte Kirk (who portrays Nicole Brown in The Juice) and different powerful producers involved in a dark sexual scheme.\n\nBeautiful Blue Eyes was finally released to the masses in 2022, 13 years after it had originally finished its production. Hopefully, Newton's new film doesn't take nearly as long.", "source": {"uri": "movieweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Movieweb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Owen Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.

Simpson as an innocent man.\n\nThe former USC Heisman winner recently passed away after a battle with cancer, and his legacy will always be mainly remembered as the guy who beat a pair of murder charges.\n\nThe Juice was acquitted of killing his ex-wife and Ron Goldman in the most famous murder trial in the past 50+ years. Despite being acquitted, many in America have always believed O.J. carried out the brutal killings.\n\nWell, director Joshua Newton is making a movie about how O.J. is actually innocent, and offered a bag of money to Wilson to star in it. The answer, in no uncertain terms, was a firm no.\n\n\"Owen Wilson was perfect for the role. I actually had a meeting with him in Santa Monica. Everybody loved the script.

But at the end of the lunch, Owen stood up and said, 'If you think I'm going to take the lead role in a movie about how O.J. didn't do it, you've got to be kidding me,'\" Newton told the Rambling Reporter.\n\nThis situation reminds me a little of Dave Chappelle's bit about how he was constantly running into O.J. Simpson, and at one point, said a photo with the Juice wouldn't be good for his career.\n\nGetting paid $12 million for a movie is a lot of money, but does anyone want to be the face of a movie alleging O.J. Simpson was innocent of killing Nicole and Ron? I don't think so. That seems like a really bad career move.\n\nRemember, being found not guilty isn't the same as being innocent. Many Americans think O.J. Simpson was guilty as sin, but got away with it.\n\nStarring in a movie about how he was innocent.....might not be the greatest idea, even for $12 million.\n\nHaving said that, I would 100% watch a movie about how O.J. didn't do it.

Simpson gets the electric chair in shocking teaser for The Juice", "body": "The filmmakers say Owen Wilson turned down $12 million to star in the movie.\n\nLess than two weeks after O.J. Simpson died from cancer, a provocative new teaser for a long-gestating movie about the controversial football star and acquitted murder suspect condemns him to the electric chair on screen.\n\nThe project in question is The Juice, a \"satirical thriller\" that has been in the works for nearly a decade and was formerly titled Nicole and O.J. The notorious NFL-player-turned-actor is played by Boris Kodjoe, known for his roles in projects like Brown Sugar, Soul Food, The Last Man on Earth, and Station 19.\n\nIn the brief teaser (which you can watch below), Kodjoe's Simpson is strapped to an electric chair, and as the charges course through his body, he says, \"Think of the real O.J. Simpson, not this lost person.\" Text on the screen says, \"Feel better now? You haven't seen anything yet.\"\n\nThe footage ends with a link to a Google Form requesting suggestions for \"outrageous ideas\" to include in the movie.\n\nWriter-director Joshua Newton has shot about 30 minutes of the film so far, mostly consisting of flashback footage of Simpson and his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson, here played by Charlotte Kirk. The footage was filmed in Bulgaria in 2018, in recreations of the couple's Southern California homes.\n\nHowever, Kirk and Kodjoe will not be portraying the film's lead characters, despite the previous title -- instead, the protagonist will be attorney Douglas McCann, who represented Simpson in an unsuccessful bid to procure evidence allegedly withheld by Verizon predecessor GTE that McCann said would exonerate Simpson.\n\nA publicist for the film told Entertainment Weekly that McCann will be played by a \"fabulous\" actor but declined to identify them. The publicist also backed a Hollywood Reporter article published Wednesday that said Owen Wilson was previously offered a hefty sum to play McCann.\n\n\"Owen Wilson turned down the role for $12 million, which we think he'll regret one day, because when you're going to see the whole movie completed, you'll understand this is playing a character of a guy who really existed,\" the publicist told EW . \"This is a true story. A story which is, in many ways, mind-blowing. This s--- really happened.\"\n\nA representative for Wilson didn't immediately respond to EW's request for comment.\n\nPrior reports about the film have suggested that it will present an argument that definitively exonerates Simpson from Brown's murder. Newton told THR that Wilson ended their meeting by saying, \"If you think I'm going to take the lead role in a movie about how O.J. didn't do it, you've got to be kidding me.\"\n\nThe film's publicist told EW that Newton \"spent years researching this story, going through every single word of the court transcripts,\" and that the filmmaker has met with individuals involved in Simpson's murder trial -- though the production won't disclose who at this point. (THR previously reported that Simpson defense attorney F. Lee Bailey praised the script as \"smashing.\")\n\nAdditionally, the Daily Mail reported in 2019 that Newton turned down Simpson's offer to serve as a consultant on the project. At the time of the report, the film was aiming to release in time for the trial's 25th anniversary in 2020; now the plan is for a 2025 release, coinciding with the 30th anniversary.\n\nNewton previously made headlines in 2022 when he sued Facebook parent company Meta for $700 million for banning posts about his Holocaust film Beautiful Blue Eyes due to its title violating the company's policies about race.\n\nThe Juice was also implicated in a tangled legal saga wherein Newton received millions of dollars for the film's budget as part of a settlement in a legal battle between executives at Warner Bros. and NBCUniversal and Kirk, whom Newton was dating at the time.", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Owen Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.

But at the end of the lunch, Owen stood up and said, 'If you think I'm going to take the lead role in a movie about how OJ didn't do it, you've got to be kidding me.' \"\n\nThe OJ Simpson Movie Moved Forward Without Owen Wilson\n\nThe film is currently in production, having moved on with an unspecified actor for the role. Newton's plan is to get the movie completed by Oct. 3 of this year, which would mark the 29th anniversary of Simpson being found not guilty in court. The film has gotten a sneak peek teaser trailer, revealing Simpson strapped to an electric chair. Also shown in the message, \"Feel better now? You haven't seen anything yet.\"\n\nRelated 10 Most Disturbing True Crime Docuseries Every true crime docuseries is disturbing, but these ones are particularly stomach-churning, for varying reasons.\n\nSimpson rose to fame with his accomplishments in college and NFL football, going on to become more well-known as a spokesperson for Hertz and an actor in movies like the Naked Gun trilogy. He is best known for his televised trial for the killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman. Simpson was found not guilty in 1995, but in 1998, he was found liable for their deaths in a civil suit filed by the victims' families. Simpson would later serve time in prison from 2008 to 2017 over confronting a sports memorabilia dealer at gunpoint, despite his claims that the dealer had stolen merchandise from him. Simpson died on April 10 due to complications from cancer.\n\nThe Juice is expected to be released in 2025.\n\nSource: The Hollywood Reporter", "source": {"uri": "cbr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_dick@cbr.com", "name": "Jeremy Dick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thriller film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Owen Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.

Although the former NFL star was not found guilty in the 1995 trial, he was later convicted in civil court and ordered to pay compensation to the respective families. OJ Simpson's innocence is a topic that has been hotly debated. And it seems Owen Wilson's mind has been made up as he reportedly rejected an offer to appear in the film The Juice.\n\nIn a chat with The Hollywood Reporter, British filmmaker Joshua Newton discussed how he had contacted Owen Wilson about appearing in the film.

Producer Stephen Small previously discussed this in an interview with People. \"We're telling the truth. It's based on factual evidence: the real story from court documents, witness interviews, and trial testimony,\" he said. \"We felt there was an injustice. A lot of people forget that the man was acquitted.\"\n\nHe continued, \"He was found by 12 jurors that he did not commit the murders but if you talk to anyone, 10 out 10 people on the street are going to go, 'He did it.'

Simpson Have?", "body": "For most of his life, O.J. Simpson was a very popular figure. He was an outstanding athlete, had a career in the film industry, though he's arguably also one of the most controversial figures in American history. Much has been written about his career in football, his trial for murder, and his subsequent legal entanglements. However, less attention has been paid to his family life. Behind the headlines and the courtroom drama, O.J. Simpson had significant family ties, and fathered several kids.\n\nOn April 10, 2024, the legendary athlete died at the age of 76 due to prostate cancer. While the news of his passing was overshadowed by his controversial legal issues, some people sympathized with his family. Following his death, many have also wondered about the family and kids of O.J. Simpson. He is succeeded by four children. Here's what we know about them.\n\nBorn on December 4, 1968, Arnelle Simpson is the first of three kids O.J. Simpson shares with his first wife, Marguerite Whitley. Not much is known about the 55-year-old woman as she has lived a very private life. However, throughout her father's legal troubles, she was very supportive of him. When she spoke to the parole board during a hearing in 2017 for her father, it was clear she loved him, despite everything.\n\n\"My experience with him is that he's like my best friend and my rock,\" she said. \"As a family, we recognize he's not the perfect man, but as a man and a father he has done his best to behave in a way that speaks to his overall nature and character,\" she continued, emotional. It's currently unknown what their relationship was like right before O.J. passed. However, Arnelle Simpson was certainly the most active and visible of O.J. Simpson's kids throughout his complicated ordeal.\n\nThe second of O.J. and Marguerite's kids, Jason Lamar Simpson was born on April 21st, 1970. In his early years, Jason was inseparable from his father, and was seen with The Juice often. However, after things took a tragic turn in 1994, their relationship took a hit. Although he is probably the most popular of the Simpson siblings, Jason lives a very private life. According to a piece published by The LA Times in 2017, he was working as a chef at St. Cecilia, a restaurant in Atlanta.\n\nOn September 24th, 1977, O.J. Simpson and Marguerite Whitley welcomed the last of their three kids, Aaren Simpson. However, the child sadly drowned right before her second birthday in 1979. The incident shook the entire family. Simpson barely ever addressed it afterward.\n\nAfter Simpson and Whitley divorced in 1979, the former football player got together with Nicole Brown. Subsequently, the pair tied the knot on February 2, 1985. Several months after their marriage, O.J. and Nicole welcomed the first of their two kids, Sydney Brooke Simpson. She was born on October 17, 1985. Since her mother's tragic death in 1994, Sydney's relationship with her father has been strained. She moved to Florida with her brother Justin in 2000, where she has spent most of her time since. In 2010, she graduated from Boston University with a degree in Sociology. Sydney Brooke now works in real estate, and owns several properties in Florida.\n\nJustin Ryan Simpson is the youngest of O.J. Simpson's kids. He was born to the former football player and Nicole Brown on August 6, 1988. Like his older sister Sydney, Justin Ryan also works in real estate, but as a realtor. Despite the drama surrounding his late father and their family, the 35-year-old seems to have lived a good life. David Brobeck, Justin and Sydney's godfather, told PEOPLE in April 2024, \"They've grown up, and they have their own families now, and they're doing really well.\"", "source": {"uri": "hotnewhiphop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotNewHipHop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "demi_phillips@hotnewhiphop.com", "name": "Demi Phillips", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.

Simpson Murder Trial", "body": "Did gaming the O.J. Simpson murder trial allow for deeper conversations about our most hidden emotions, ugliest prejudices, and disturbing desires?\n\nNow that O.J. Simpson has died, it is worthwhile reassessing what the celebrity's 11-month murder trial meant for the citizenry -- and not just regarding race, Hollywood culture, or even the US justice system. What did O.J. Simpson's murder trial mean for gaming culture? In retrospect, can it be proposed that the so-called \"Trial of the Century\" constituted a brief, albeit strenuous moment in US history when race could be explored simultaneously seriously and farcically?\n\nVastly different from the US' more recent reckoning on race (namely, the police murder of George Floyd in May 2020), the O.J. Simpson trial, which ran from November 1994 to October 1995, was theatrical, even ludic in character. The trial provided the perfect fodder to be gamified via board games, toys, and even in the classroom. Today, roughly 30 years hence, the gamified fanfare surrounding the O.J. affair feels simultaneously more macabre, more racist, but also perhaps more productive.\n\nA double homicide is unquestionably gruesome business. Cosplaying an accused murderer is palpably morbid and quite possibly racist. Yet, perhaps only at play can some of the most effective learning occur. Somewhat like the \"ironic bigotry\" of, say, Cards Against Humanity, did gamifying the O.J. murder trial allow for deeper conversations about our most hidden emotions, our ugliest prejudices, and our most disturbing desires?\n\nThe general contours of the case are, to say least, well-known. Between 9 November 1994 and 3 October 1995, the United States - seemingly the entire world -- watched transfixed as O.J. Simpson was tried and eventually acquitted for killing his estranged ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. In the days and months after police first arrived at the home of Nicole Simpson on 12 June 1994, the subsequent and sensational events surrounding the murder trial included something for everyone: sports, a car chase, talk of institutional racism, lovers' quarrels, and tense courtroom drama between celebrity lawyers.\n\nWhen the trial began on 24 January 1995, Judge Lance A. Ito had already made the controversial decision to allow the proceedings to be televised. The case would become the longest and most expensive in US history. It also quickly became a type of Rorschach test for the American public, serving as a way to see ourselves in terms of race, consumerism, and even sexuality.\n\nThe O.J. Simpson trial offered a plethora of episodes that catalyzed deeper yet indelibly awkward conversations on these broader social issues. On 3 February, Nicole Brown's sister, Denise, testified that O.J. Simpson had abused her sibling. On 15 March, Los Angeles police officer Mark Furman denied using the \"N-word\". The 24th of March saw Nicole Simpson's house guest, Brian \"Kaeto\" Kaelin, deny having a sexual relationship with her. On 11 April, L.A.P.D. forensic specialist Dennis Fung acknowledged that there had been procedural errors during the collection of evidence. All the while, \"sidebars\" became part of high schoolers' lexicon, as Judge Lance A. Ito allowed the procedure upwards of 430 times.\n\nWhat novelties would tomorrow's court proceeding bring? How could the O.J. Simpson trial be rendered playful? Would we talk about gender relations, racial reckoning, or jurisprudence?\n\nThere is ample evidence online of board games being thematized around the trial. Of the three games, one is a Monopoly-style game that tasks participants to raise funds for O.J. Simpson's defense team:\n\n\"You have just been selected as one of O.J.'s Defense Attorneys and given an initial retainer of $75,000.00. Your objective is to gain control of as many aspects of the trial as you can, then utilize this control to accumulate more of O.J.'s Defense Fund checks than any other defense attorney\". Another sees players competing to be \"acquitted\" by reaching the finish line, all the while being stymied by the prosecution and assisted by the defense. Yet another asks players to move around a game board by correctly answering questions about the trial surrounding the case.\n\nAlso not to be forgotten are the various \"O.J. in the Slammer\" Pogs. One can only imagine the ambivalent emotions harnessed and released while slamming the Pogs around. Finally, evidence of both O.J. Simpson and Judge Ito Halloween masks from 1995 can still be found online. The O.J. Simpson masks were reported as being the most popular during the fall of 1995, a fact that in and of itself, became a subject of ridicule. Perhaps it was this particularly playful but also crude moment that provided the inspiration for an episode of the New Girl from eight years ago, when Zooey Deschanel and crew dressed as lawyers involved in the O.J. Simpson trial.\n\nOf course, the incredibly odd impulse to gamify the O.J. Simpson murder trial did not occur in a vacuum. Teenagers and young adults coming of age in the mid-'90s were the second generation to fully experience the didactic uses of televised media in the US: PBS's Mr. Roger's Neighborhood was first broadcast in 1968, and Sesame Street hit the airwaves a year later. The link between learning, media consumption, and play-making was already well-established. Educators of the mid-'90s wondered: How would the Nintendo Generation learn when media - and at this time, the O.J. Simpson trial - dominated their lives?\n\nThose in high school or college during the mid-'90s had already been subjected to the gamification of the classroom. After spending perhaps a whole class period on strategic role-playing video games such as Oregon Trail or Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? many students rushed home to play Nintendo or Sega Genesis games. Yet others participated in gamified educational endeavors via their family's household PCs: games like Math Blaster!, Mario Teaches Typing, Time Riders in American History were all products of the 1990s. All told, educational games from the '90s \"went hard.\"\n\nIn this environment, perhaps it was only natural that many American teachers infused classes with talk of the O.J. Simpson trial -- its drama, the public debates it incurred, and how it could serve as an exploration power of identity politics. Indeed, my teachers cajoled us to dress up like superstar lawyers such as lead prosecutor Marcia Clark, head of Simpson's defense team Johnnie Cochran, and advisor to the defense team Alan Dershowitz.\n\nPerhaps, teachers seemingly thought, students could simultaneously learn civics, public speaking, and racial politics, all in a game-like manner. Indeed, much of my 1995 school year was spent playmaking a former footballer's Hollywood story of murder, all under the guise of education. While the girls chosen to interpret the role of Marcia Clark would only (thankfully!) be asked to scrounge up a dark blazer before the debate, Judge Ito's beard led to some rather (ahem!) hairy makeup and costume elaborations.\n\nThe internet still stores many high school lesson plans -- instances of teachers helping teachers -- involving the O.J. Simpson trial. Notable examples can be found here and here, there -- really, everywhere. Most, like the PBS website, aim at \"Facilitating Discussions on Racism, Prejudice, and Discrimination\". Gen-Xers in high school were not the only students subjected to the supposed \"didacticism\" of the O.J. Simpson trial. Colleges, universities, and especially law schools found the sensational court case irresistible. A particularly telling article published in The Chicago Tribune in January 1995 reported that professors at law schools across the country were \"grappling with whether to shy away from century-old theories and crusty cases capsulized in Bible-sized textbooks and opt instead for The People of the State of California vs. Orenthal James Simpson\".\n\nAs a historical document, \"To O.J. Or Not to O.J.\" shows how at least some instructors wrestled with the issue of whether the O.J. Simpson trial was sufficiently compelling as a jurisprudence exemplum. The fact that PBS' website proposes that students approach the O.J. Simpson trial alongside reading Langston Hughes' poem, \"Dinner Guest: Me\" and a few choice passages from Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man seems less convincing. From our vantage point, the allusion to such great art in the context of the O.J. Simpson case has aged badly.\n\nWith O.J. Simpson now deceased, his case is more than just closed. Looking back on the spectacle that was his trial tasks educators to return to the connection between gaming and the most pressing issues facing the social world. Recently, some are exploring virtual reality methods to educate students about the importance of history and empathy. Educators are increasingly understanding the importance of pop culture in the classroom and what it can teach. I wonder how many Gen-Xers raised during the O.J. Simpson trial tuned in to FX's The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.\n\nKane, Sharon. \"What Part of Speech Is O. J. Simpson?: Teaching Grammar and Style through the News\".

Simpson was surrounded by his \"children and grandchildren\" during his final moments, his attorney said only one person was present at his death.\n\nMalcolm LaVergne, Simpson's longtime lawyer and executor of his property and holdings, told the Associated Press that a statement made on X on April 11, claiming the infamous NFL running back was with his family when he passed, was not correct.\n\nInstead, according to LaVergne, Simpson was accompanied solely by a close family member, whose identity his attorney did not disclose.\n\nO.J. Simpson, 76, died on April 10 after a year battling prostate cancer.\n\nJust two months prior to his death, Simpson posted a video on social media platform X, assuring his fans that he was in \"good\" health.\n\nIn his final days, Simpson's home was under strict security to prevent information leaks.\n\nVisitors, including family and medical staff, were required to sign non-disclosure agreements, and mobile phones were prohibited.\n\nAccording to TMZ, between 30 to 50 friends and family members, including his children from his marriages to Nicole Brown Simpson and Marguerite Whitley, visited him as his condition worsened.\n\nHowever, it seems he died alone with the exception of being in the presence of one other person.\n\n\"You have to remember that they've shared OJ with the world their entire lives,\" LaVergne said of Simpson's four surviving kids, according to the New York Post.\n\n\"At first they shared good OJ. But still he was famous. And then, in 1994 on, they kind of had to share bad boy OJ with the world,\" LaVergne added. \"But at the end of the day, these children just lost a father. And they have the added burden that he is one of the most famous people on the planet, and who is polarizing and who is surrounded by controversy.\"\n\nSimpson's death reignited interest in his notorious legal history, including his 1995 trial, famously dubbed the \"Trial of the Century,\" where he was acquitted of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman.\n\nColumnist Moira Donegan wrote an op-ed in The Guardian where she stated, \"Simpson died in bed, receiving medical care to make him comfortable, at the end of his natural life. He had reached old age; we can infer that when he took his last breaths, he was surrounded by well wishes and love.\"\n\nShe continued, \"His was a very different death from the one he allegedly inflicted on his former wife, Nicole Brown, and her friend Ron Goldman. They did not die in bed; they probably died screaming.

Simpson's Daughter Sydney Spotted Out in Public For the First Time Since His Death", "body": "Just weeks after O.J. Simpson passed away from prostate cancer, the former NFL star's youngest daughter Sydney was spotted out in public for the first time since the news broke.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Sydney was seen carrying a car seat while walking to her apartment in St. Petersburg, Florida. Dressed in a casual gray sweater and jeans, the 38-year-old realtor was with a man as she ran some errands.\n\nNot only is it the first time she's been spotted since her infamous father's death, the media outlet noted that she hasn't been publicly photographed in nearly six years.\n\nO.J. Simpson shared Sydney and her younger brother Justin with his late second wife, Nicole Brown. She was only eight years old when her mother was murdered on June 12, 1994. O.J. was quickly deemed a suspect in the murder due to his violent past with Brown. He was charged with her murder as well as the murder of her friend, Ron Goldman.\n\nHe was acquitted of the murders in 1995.\n\nAlthough their father's life was constantly thrust into the spotlight, Sydney and Justin managed to stay out of the public eye. They also have not spoken out about their father, except for announcing his death with their oldest half-siblings, Jason and Amelle.\n\nO.J. Simpson's children released a statement on X (formerly Twitter) announcing he died on April 10. \"He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren,\" the statement reads. The family asked for privacy and grace during the period of transition.\n\nSimpson's estate executor has since confirmed the late athlete only had one close family member by his side when he died.\n\nO.J. Simpson's Children Were Living With Nicole Brown's Parents During His Infamous1994 Murder Trial\n\nAfter he was found not guilty of murdering Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman, O.J. Simpson had to fight for the custody of Sydney and Justin. The children had been living with their maternal grandparents, Louis and Judith Brown since their father's 1994 arrest.\n\nAfter the court ruled in O.J. Simpson's favor and gave the children back to him, the Browns released a statement about the decision. They admitted to being concerned about Syndey and Justin's well-being while they were with their father.\n\n\"We love Sydney and Justin and pray for their safety and well-being as they return to their father,\" the Browns stated, per CNN.\n\nThe Browns' attorney, Natasha Roit, slammed Judge Wieben-Stock's decision. She stated the evidence proving Simpson's domestic violence tendencies was clearly ignored.\n\n\"It is illogical to us that [the judge] can decide a cast on domestic...without considering the evidence of murder,\" Roit stated.\n\nDuring the custody case, O.J. Simpson's attorneys argued that as the biological parent, he should be allowed to care for his children.", "source": {"uri": "suggest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Suggest"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.

Simpson case forced domestic violence into the spotlight", "body": "Thirty years ago, as women's rights advocates worked to pass the 1994 Violence Against Women Act, domestic violence was still something of a hushed topic.\n\nThen Nicole Brown Simpson's death forced it into the spotlight. Americans riveted by the murder investigation of superstar ex-husband O.J. Simpson, who died Wednesday at 76, heard startling and painful details of the abuse she said she suffered at his hands.\n\n\"We must have had 20 media trucks lined up on Hollywood Boulevard to talk to us,\" said Patti Giggans, executive director of the Los Angeles-based nonprofit Peace Over Violence, who said interest in the issue exploded overnight.\n\n\"Because it was O.J. -- he's famous, an athlete, handsome, everybody loved O.J. -- we started to have conversations about what goes on in the mind of a batterer,\" Giggans said. \"We were able to maintain that conversation throughout that two-year period (of the case). I think it changed the movement.\"\n\nGiven that victims -- then and now -- often hide their abuse, many people assumed it happened only to poor or marginalized women. But then they saw that neither Nicole Simpson's privilege nor her earlier calls to police had insulated her.\n\n\"She was beautiful, she was white, she was famous, she was wealthy. So, there was this sense that if it could happen to her, it could happen to anybody,\" said Rachel Louise Snyder, an American University professor who explored the issue in her 2019 book, \"No Visible Bruises.\"\n\nIn an undated letter that surfaced after her death, Nicole Simpson revealed that her NFL star-turned-celebrity husband gave her \"disgusted\" looks when she gained weight in her first pregnancy in 1988 and \"beat the holy hell\" out of her the following year, although the couple told an X-ray lab she had fallen off a bike.\n\nIn October 1993, a year after they divorced, she called 911 when Simpson showed up at her home \"ranting and raving.\"\n\n\"He's in a white Bronco, but first of all he broke the back door down to get in,\" she said. \"He's O.J. Simpson. I think you know his record.\"\n\nEight months later, she and friend Ron Goldman -- who had stopped by to return eyeglasses left at a restaurant that night -- were fatally stabbed outside her Brentwood home. Her two young children with Simpson were inside. She was 35, Goldman just 25.\n\n\"This was absolutely a watershed case,\" said Snyder, who said their June 12, 1994, deaths helped galvanize support for the Violence Against Women Act, which Congress passed that fall. \"It spurred a national conversation, a national reckoning.\"\n\nSimpson was acquitted of the double-murder at the sensational trial the next year, but a different jury found him liable for their deaths in a 1997 civil trial. Simpson was ordered to pay $33.5 million to the two families, money they tried mostly in vain to collect.\n\nIn the years since, the Violence Against Women Act has funded more than $9 billion in grants to combat domestic violence, from police training to social services to the 1996 launch of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. The hotline received 75,000 calls that first year. Last year, it handled more than 400,000 calls, texts and chat messages.\n\nHotline officials, in a statement in response to Simpson's death, said the numbers reflect \"the skyrocketing need among survivors for compassionate and non-judgmental advocacy as well as the pervasiveness of domestic violence in the U.S.\"\n\nOver time, advocates have focused on the warning signs that someone's life could be in danger. Victims are most vulnerable when they try to get help or end the relationship, and in the year or so afterward. (The Simpson divorce was finalized in late 1992.) Any attempt at strangling the victim, or putting hands on their neck, may be a final escalation before the situation turns deadly. And the presence of a gun greatly increases the risk of being killed.\n\nYet understanding the cycle of violence isn't always enough to thwart it. As news of Simpson's death broke Thursday, advocates near Philadelphia were reeling from the fatal stabbing of a 57-year-old woman. She had pursued charges and gotten a restraining order last month after her estranged husband allegedly assaulted her and tried to strangle her. Police believe he kicked in a window air conditioner to break into her home early Wednesday.\n\n\"This case for advocates is excruciating,\" said Stacy Dougherty, deputy director of the local nonprofit Laurel House, which provides housing and victim services in Montgomery County.\n\n\"When you have someone who does everything that she's supposed to do -- she calls the police, she gets the protection order, she changes her locks, she reaches out for help, she does all of those things.

Simpson Trial", "body": "(O.J. Simpson died today and it pushed me to finish this piece about the street I lived on in my mid-twenties, a block from the site of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman on Bundy Drive in Los Angeles.)\n\n\"Which one do you like?\" O.J. Simpson queried, as he leaned over to me on the railing of the upper floor of the Red Onion Night Club in Palm Springs, aka \"The Red O,\" a chain of meat market bars in Southern California that were big in the 80s.\n\nWe were looking down at a Bikini Contest, which had a fairly sparse field, in fact there were only two contestants. Both were attractive women in their late-twenties, who stood out because in terms of looks and age, at least in comparison to the rest of the college crowd there for Spring Break in 1989. The two women were a bit older than the mean at the Red Onion and were dressed in what could best be described as neon stripper bikinis. My two male friends Duane and Jeff were downstairs, and I had wandered up to the second floor for a look around. I leaned against the railing, looking down, with people on either side of me, one of whom turned out to be O.J. Simpson.\n\nWe had noticed \"the Juice\" quickly in the club earlier that night. He was taller than most and impossible to mistake as O.J. Simpson. He was also a good 22 years senior to us, and at least 15 years older than anyone else there. He wore a sports coat and open dress shirt collar, whereas many of us were in Spring Break-themed t-shirts. Seeing O.J. hanging around actually wasn't entirely abnormal, in our college years experience. O.J. was a USC alumni, where we went to school. Arguably USC's most famous football hero, he was a frequent presence on campus before the Saturday football games, where his former team played at the Coliseum. O.J. was known to be friendly, would shake hands and take pictures with anyone, and so here he was again, a perennial USC college student at a place that was probably 1/8th USC students on spring break. This, however, was the first and only conversation I ever had with him, when he started discussing the physical attributes of the Bikini Contest participants.\n\nBefore I could give my opinion, O.J. answered for me, \"The one in the yellow has the bigger boobs.\" He motioned with his hands as if he were placing them on her breasts.\n\nI couldn't argue with this physical fact and nodded. I also was enjoying the celebrity male camaraderie, so I nodded pretty vigorously. This seemed to decide things. Girl in the Yellow it was.\n\nThe DJ interrupted our bonding with, \"We have a special celebrity guest in the house, ladies and gentlemen, O.J. Simpson!! He's going to be our final judge in the Bikini Contest.\" He pointed to O.J. on the balcony next to me, and there was general applause as everyone looked up. O.J. left without saying goodbye and headed downstairs to grab the mike and award the prize, whatever it was, to the Girl in the Yellow.\n\nMy impressions of Orenthal James Simpson that night? 1.) He enjoyed being a celebrity, 2.) He also liked being \"one of the guys,\" 3.) He was a big dude, 4.) He seemed like a horndog, although so were all of us. And as much as he seemed to love to be loved, there were plenty of people who loved him back. That night, I was one of them. There is a \"celebrity high\" I've noticed after a famous person gave me their attention, particularly when I was younger. It was like an adrenaline charge that perked up my energy, made me speak faster, and made me momentarily happier. This may have been a momentary mental illness also, but I'm sure I'm not the only one. I'm not real proud of it, but there it is.\n\nOther than seeing him in the popular Naked Gun movies, I didn't think about O.J. much again until several years later, in 1994, when he was in the back of the White Bronco speeding down the L.A. freeways with Al Cowlings at the wheel. My West L.A. roommates and myself were watching the infamous chase on live television and when we saw the Bronco turn onto the 405 Freeway, which was the closest to us, we all ran out, piled into my car, and drove to get a glimpse of the most famous car chase in history. By the time we got anywhere close, though, we could hear on the news that Cowlings had already turned off onto surface streets, and we went home dejectedly.\n\nI told my \"I once met O.J.\" story to friends that day, of course, because it made me feel more important, but I would be one of literal thousands in Los Angeles who were simultaneously telling similar stories. While picking the jury for the murder trial, numerous people were dismissed simply because they had met O.J. at one time or another, leading one news commentator to note, \"It seems like nearly everyone in L.A. had an O.J. encounter of their own.\" One juror was actually dismissed because he hadn't disclosed that he had taken a picture with O.J. at a store where he worked.\n\nA few months later, by December 1994, I was in the middle of a disintegrating roommate situation and was in a rush to find a new place to live. It turns out that one Paul Amakori, the owner of the apartment I had answered an ad about, was also in a rush to find a new place to live. So much so that he quickly approved me without a credit check to move into his apartment on Dorothy Street in Brentwood, which was about a block away from the condominium where Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman had been murdered just five months earlier, across the street from the intersection of Dorothy and Bundy Drive. I had looked at several apartments that day in the general neighborhood of West L.A., and had not put together how close I was to the \"murder house,\" as it was known in the neighborhood, until a few days after moving, when a friend came to visit and marveled, \"I didn't realize. You're right HERE!\"\n\nThe location of my new apartment wasn't a factor plus or minus for me, but it was for my new landlord, Mr. Amakori, who later confided that he wanted to move somewhere else until all the \"weirdos\" went away. He seemed to want to get out of the neighborhood so badly that I used to half-joke to myself that Mr. Amakori had something to do with the murders, but also partially because of another reason, unspoken by Mr. Amakori, and which I found out from neighbors. Mr. Amakori was really moving out was because he had assaulted my upstairs neighbor, a senior man, for making too much noise while walking around in the middle of the night. The senior man did walk loud as hell in fact, but I just turned my music louder. Apparently, Mr. Amakori had tackled the old man and tried to choke him before the man's wife pulled him off. However, as the O.J. Trial went on, it became clearer that while my landlord was a violent asshole, he probably was not the violent asshole who committed these murders a block away.\n\nThe \"weirdos\" had certainly now descended upon Dorothy Street in 1994, which was otherwise a small residential artery between the far bigger Barrington and Bundy passages, largely composed of 2-3 story apartment buildings and duplexes, where young professional twenty-somethings lived with roommates, along with some couples, and some seniors. Sleepy for the most part. A place that basically went to bed pretty early, because most people worked. Younger folks would occasionally have a party, but that was a rarity.\n\nBundy Drive was a major street which ran through West L.A., although it was just one lane on each side. Not long after moving into the apartment on Dorothy, I became obsessed with the details of the Simpson case, largely because I could walk right out my door and come up with my own theories on the actual street the murders happened on.\n\nThe traffic on Bundy came in waves, so there were times at night, sometimes as long as a minute, when there was no traffic at all. Then there would be several cars at once, all going fast, with little time for a driver to glance on either side of the road. The corner of Bundy and Dorothy was very quiet at times in the evening. There were dog walkers, the occasional jogger, a few pedestrians, but often, there was simply no one. At night, the street remained dimly lit, with just a few street lights, but pockets of shadow everywhere. In short, there was ample time for someone covered in blood and even carrying a knife, to run out of the condo and to a car, without anyone seeing a thing. Around the 10 PM hour, when the murders were thought to have occurred, Bundy could have been very inactive and silent, as it often was. Even if one of the cars that sped down Bundy were passing at the exact right moment, the driver would have to look to the side and catch a glimpse of the running killer on a poorly-lit road.\n\n875 South Bundy Drive, the condo owned by Nicole Brown Simpson, wasn't in a traditional \"condo\" complex. I think that there were separate units next to each other, but remain unsure. The doorway to her condo could barely be seen from Bundy, nor much of the building itself, only the entrance and gate, flanked by shrubbery. Although it came to be one of the most photographed locations in the world for a time, and I stood across from it more often than I can count, I still couldn't tell you what the shape of the building itself was. There was a path of tan tiles leading up to the gate, small palm leaves and shrubs which obscured the gate itself, and another walkway inside of the gate, which could only partially be seen.\n\nAbout once a week, always in the evening, I would walk up Dorothy to Bundy, and stare across at the palm-covered entrance. I could never bring myself to walk right up to the gate of the condo. It somehow felt like that would be more disrespectful, although I don't know who I thought was going to be judging me.\n\nI, along with countless others surely, engaged in a \"What if I were there?\" conversation with myself, as I stood across from the condo What if I were just walking past when the killer, presumably covered in blood and perhaps carrying a knife, came running out? Suppose it was O.J.? Or O.J. and accomplices? Or a different killer altogether? Was I so celebrity-obsessed that I would ask O.J. if he remembered meeting me at the Red Onion during Spring Break 89 and only after notice the blood? Would I have had the guts to try to stop him? Would I have even known he should be stopped?\n\nSome of my neighbors on the street would start appearing as witnesses in the trial, the most notable being Robert Heidstra, a shaggy-haired man with a heavy European accent who appeared to be in his early 60s, worked as a car detailer according to the news, and who was walking his large sheepdog close to Nicole Brown Simpson's condo close to the time of the murders. He remembered hearing two male voices who appeared to be arguing. He then walked a bit further down and, shortly thereafter, saw a \"white, jeep-like vehicle\" speed off. Heidstra also announced that he was writing a book about his experiences, although I'm not sure they would merit more than a novella. I would often see Heidstra, who basically lived across the street from me, walking his large sheep dog up and down Dorothy Street. He seemed to walk the dog constantly. We once got into an argument over a parking spot that I had nabbed before him, and that was the extent of our personal interaction.\n\nThe Trial made me aware of other neighbors who I never would have likely noticed otherwise. Such as actress Gloria Stuart, then in her 80s, who lived almost directly across the street from Nicole Simpson's condo, in a lovely house on South Bundy Drive. Initially most famous for co-starring in The Invisible Man in 1933, Titanic would bring her a late-life comeback, and Oscar nomination, two years later in 1997. I never saw Gloria Stuart while living on Dorothy, but she reportedly had to move out during the peak years of the trial, due to the number of random people knocking on her door, looking for the house. And unlike my landlord Mr. Amakori, I was 100 percent sure that Gloria Stuart did not commit the murders.\n\nPerhaps the most surreal thing about life on Dorothy Street in the middle of the last decade of the 20th Century, was that, while the road may have been eerily quiet for long stretches at night, the days had become something different. \"O.J. Lookee-Loos,\" or tourists in search of the the murder house, would constantly be stopping their cars to take pictures in front of it. Sometimes on the sidewalk. Sometimes right up by the gate. Some somber, some smiling. Sometimes entire families took pictures in front of the condo, mom, dad, and two kids. Their arms around each other, often they would be wearing t-shirts from Universal Studios and Disney. Today, those people would have likely posted those photos on Instagram. But there were others who were there with less crass, and more emotional responses, to the murders. One woman stood across the street with a large hand-written sign that began, \"Nicole, my heart breaks for you...\" along with several other lines that I was driving too fast to read. It wasn't clear if she was holding the sign for anyone in particular to see, and likely, this was something she just wanted to express, with the sign being the method. There was no media covering the neighborhood the day the woman with the sign appeared, unlike the day when the Jury was walked through the murder site, and I myself walked out the front door into a street filled with people and news crews. \"Melrose\" Larry Green, who was a Z-List celebrity vaguely famous for standing on the corner of Melrose Avenue and La Brea with signs every day praising Howard Stern, was walking past at the same time with an O.J.-Howard-related sign worn as a poster board, the nonsensical text of which I have forgotten. A Stern fan myself back then, I made the mistake of telling him that I enjoyed his work, and he quickly asked if he could use my bathroom. I told him, sorry, the toilet wasn't flushing, and he shuffled down the street. Maybe my landlord had had the right idea about getting out of this neighborhood while he could.\n\nJust a few blocks away, in downtown Brentwood, the suddenly most famous restaurant in America, Mezzaluna, constantly mentioned as the place where Ron Goldman worked as a waiter and Nicole Brown Simpson had her last meal, was actually struggling, after years of success prior to the murders. A maitre'd had told a mutual friend that tourists would come in and order one drink and take pictures, and then just leave. The regular clientele had subsequently moved on, partially to avoid the gawkers, but also because there was a morbidity hanging over the place. An unescapable eeriness that went along with dining there. El Coyote, which was where Sharon Tate, Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger, and Wojiech Frykowski dined last before being murdered by the Manson Family, had somehow survived that same type of stigma and is still packing them in for moderately-priced Mexican food and margaritas today. A difference may have been that El Coyote was something of a tourist trap to begin with, whereas Mezzaluna reluctantly became one.\n\nO.J. Fever didn't last forever. By 1999, the Lookee-Loo traffic at the condo dwindled down to the point that you could wait a few hours and not notice anyone looking for the condo. The world had moved on. Except that a seismic event like the O.J. Simpson Trial resonates through the decades. The fame of the name Kardashian started with the late attorney Robert Kardashian representing O.J. as part of his Dream Team. Numerous news pundits and analysts got their first big breaks covering the Trial, including Harvey Levin, who went on to create TMZ.com. Arguments about race and the LAPD that became a centerpiece of the Trial were still being debated decades later when the very well-written and directed mini-series \"The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\" aired.\n\nI had been gone from L.A. for over a decade when I returned last year and drove down Dorothy Street again, one night. I parked at the corner near Bundy and stood across the street from the condo. The street number and facade of the building had changed, but land doesn't often change. It was clear where the original condo location was. There were no Lookie-Loos.\n\nBundy was quiet, as it often was at night. Several cars then flew past, in a wave like they always did decades before. And then it was quiet once more.", "source": {"uri": "terrykeefe.medium.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medium"}, "authors": [{"uri": "terry_keefe@terrykeefe.medium.com", "name": "Terry Keefe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centinela_Avenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centinela Avenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Brown_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicole Brown Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.

Over time, I've forgiven him, as I feel it's the only way to move forward - but I'll never forget'.\n\nThough Nicole and OJ's seven-year marriage was rife with allegations of domestic abuse - including an incident in 1978 when he allegedly punched and kicked her in a hotel room for hours - Tanya shed a different light.\n\nLooking back on her sister's marriage - which ended in divorce in 1992 - Tanya revealed that they appeared to be the 'perfect couple'.\n\nShe also spoke of her sister receiving expensive gifts from her multi-millionaire husband, including Italian luxury sports car Ferrari.\n\nTanya, who insisted her brother-in-law was always kind to her too, recalled how challenging it was to accept he was capable of murder, but said irrefutable DNA evidence at the time had convinced her.\n\nAt OJ's controversial 1995 murder trial - often dubbed the trial of the century - police claimed they found a blood-soaked sock near the bed in his murdered ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson's home.\n\nDNA analysis indicated that some of that blood came from OJ - purportedly placing the former football star at the scene of the crime.\n\nTanya added that she had tried to put the tragic killing behind her and was more focused on her older sibling's legacy.\n\nTanya told the publication her older sister 'was the most wonderful person'\n\nTanya opened up about the gruesome murders - which left her sister nearly decapitated - and said although she had forgiven him, she would never forget (pictured with her book Finding Peace Amid The Chaos: My Escape from Depression and Suicide)\n\nTo conclude, she said she hoped her sister would be remembered as more than just a murder victim.\n\nIn 2022, Tanya called out comedian Chris Rock over he joke he made about Nicole while hosting a standup show.\n\nThe comedian, 59, was on his Ego Death comedy tour in Phoenix when he told the crowd that he turned down hosting the Oscars, just months after Will Smith slapped him on live TV during the 2022 Oscar telecast.\n\nHe told his fans that returning to host would be like, asking Nicole Brown Simpson, 'to go back to the restaurant,' referencing the late wife of O.J. Simpson on the night she was murdered.\n\nNicole was dining at an Italian restaurant and left her sunglasses there, with waiter Ron Goldman returning the glasses to her before they were both brutally murdered outside of her home.\n\nTanya took to her Instagram shortly afterwards to defend her sister.\n\nOJ Simpson at a premiere with then-wife Nicole Brown and their children Sydney and Justin\n\nOJ met Nicole when she was a teenage waitress at the trendy Beverly Hills restaurant, The Daisy. They met when he dined there and they became inseparable (pictured 1980)\n\nOJ Simpson wed his first wife Marguerite Whitley in 1967. They welcomed daughter Arnelle, now 55, and son Jason, 53\n\n'Nothing Is more lovely then to wake up on a Tuesday morning (Not) with TMZ calling you saying Chris Rock made a horrible \"joke\" about Nicole,' she began, adding the joke was, 'BEYOND distasteful!'\n\n'Nothing funny about his joke towards Jada as she suffers from a physical condition and nothing funny about equating an Oscar host invitation to a double homicide,' she added, referencing his original Oscar night joke about Jada Pinkett Smith being bald due to suffering from alopecia.\n\n'I always thought he was funny, but he crossed the line with this one. In other words, Y'all!!!! Stop using my sister, OJ and Ron as part of your cricking comedy act. There are families behind this tragedy!' she concluded.\n\nOJ Simpson wed his first wife Marguerite Whitley in 1967 when he was just 19 years old.\n\nThe pair welcomed daughter Arnelle, now 55, and son Jason, 53. The couple also shared daughter Aaren who was born in 1977 but died just one month before her second birthday in 1979 after drowning in the family's pool.\n\nThey divorced in 1979 - when Simpson was already seeing Nicole - who was 20 to his 32.\n\nIt was previously reported that Simpson had been battling prostate cancer and undergoing chemotherapy\n\nOJ and Nicole married in 1985 and welcomed daughter Sydney Brooke, now 39 that year and son Justin, 36, in 1988.\n\nIn 1989, the former football player pleaded no contest to a domestic violence charge against Simpson. The couple divorced in 1992.\n\nThe children were just eight and five at the time of their mother's murder and asleep in the home when their mother was stabbed to death on June 12, 1994 alongside Goldman, who was 25.\n\nOn April 10 2024, OJ Simpson died aged 76 following a battle with prostate cancer - nearly three decades on from the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend Ron Goldman.\n\nIt was previously reported that Simpson had been battling prostate cancer and undergoing chemotherapy\n\nThe notorious murder suspect who was found civilly liable for the two killings died surrounded by his family at his home in Las Vegas.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Jamaica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Order of Jamaica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Brown_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nicole Brown Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.

Fallen Hero - Rafu Shimpo", "body": "There are two iconic celebrities who would be great characters in a Shakespearean tragedy...\n\nAmerica's Dad, Bill Cosby, and O.J. Simpson! Both fell from grace.\n\nSince the recent passing of O.J. Simpson, I reflected on my \"connections\" with the \"Juice,\" a childhood hero. Growing up in San Francisco, I looked up to Simpson, the kid who made it out of the Potrero Hill projects.\n\nMy friends and I idealized him, and everyone wanted to be him on the playgrounds of San Francisco when we played football. He came of age during the civil rights movement, which made him a cult hero with whites as well as African Americans.\n\nThe irony was he was far from an activist, in contrast to Jim Brown, who was also a great running back.\n\nMany of us remember the white Bronco and the chase. I even remember where I was when that happened. I was chaperoning the Marguerita School eighth-grade promotion party at a church when someone said O.J. was fleeing arrest. We rolled in a TV set and watched in amazement.\n\nThat car chase would inspire others to do the same. It is now a Southern California tradition, thanks to O.J. and the white Bronco!\n\nBesides football, it was the iconic Hertz Rent-a-Car commercial that made O.J. even more famous as he ran through the airport to return his rental car. It was really the first time an African American athlete was used to endorse a nationally known product.\n\nO.J. was also a movie star. I watched him in \"Towering Inferno,\" \"Capricorn One,\" and the \"Naked Gun\" series.\n\nThey even named the football field at Galileo after him, later rescinded after his fall from grace.\n\nI have a couple connections that relate to O.J. ... six degrees of separation.\n\nOne of my teachers at Lowell High School in S.F. was O.J.'s football coach at Galileo High School. Mr. McBride was a math and PE teacher. On \"The Tonight Show,\" O.J. credited him with putting him on the \"straight and narrow.\" I asked Mr. McBride about O.J. and the teacher was happy for O.J.'s success.\n\nAlso, there is a distant, but nonetheless a link ... We attended church with Lance Ito's (the judge who presided over the O.J. trial) parents at Mt. Hollywood Church. Lance himself attended as a youth. Over the years I had two in-person encounters with O.J.\n\nMy first encounter was when my buddy Warren Kubota and I saw the football legend at the Royal Theater in S.F. watching a movie called \"The Warriors.\" He was with a stunningly beautiful woman. That woman was Nicole Brown Simpson. They sat two rows behind us and when the film ended everyone mobbed him in the lobby.\n\nMy second encounter was at the Alhambra golf course where we were having our annual faculty golf tournament. At this point, he had already been acquitted of murdering his wife and Ronald Goldman. He sat in the corner by himself, drinking a beer. No one got up to talk to him except one of our teachers. That teacher got a lot of flack afterward from other teachers for doing this.\n\nThese encounters really exemplify the fall from grace.\n\nThe real question for me would be why would a guy who had everything going for him self-destruct? His image before the Trial of the Century was of a guy who made it out of the ghetto, had a Hall of Fame football career and became a media icon.\n\nIt's a question I think that will never be answered...", "source": {"uri": "rafu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rafu Shimpo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "O.

He was in the endzone helplessly as Isaiah Bond caught the game-winning touchdown and Jaylin Simpson slammed the ground on the sidelines when the clock hit zero as an impending defining upset descended into heartbreak.\n\nHe was angry at the way that November night in Jordan-Hare Stadium ended. So his mom, Thaquanna Cannon, thought he was going to stay. Simpson intended to play in Auburn's bowl game after all.\n\nThose who know Simpson best are quick to talk about his love for Auburn. Simpson wasn't looking for his way out. But his coaches told him it was time.\n\n\"Mom, I went in and talked to Coach Zac (Etheridge) and he was like, my draft stock is too high,\" Cannon said Simpson told her. \"I'm gonna go ahead and go.\"\n\nSimpson had a breakout season in his fifth collegiate year. He started all 12 regular season games for Auburn. He had four interceptions on his way to a first-team All-SEC season.\n\nHis agent, Lindsay Crook, said teams are looking at Simpson as a good enough talent where going back to college would have more risk than benefit. Simpson may have been iffy, Cannon said, on leaving the program just a few credits shy of graduation, but the time was now. What was the point in staying, Crook said.\n\n\"I told him, 'I don't think you can duplicate it,\" Simpson's former coach and mentor Alex Mathis -- current assistant director of player personnel at UCF -- said.\n\nSimpson accepted a Senior Bowl invitation on Dec. 6, but didn't officially declare for the NFL Draft until early January, just after Auburn's appearance in the Music City Bowl. Simpson originally expected to play in the game and traveled with the team to Nashville for practice. But he was a last-minute opt-out due to a hamstring injury he didn't want to risk with the NFL on the horizon. Crook said Simpson's body had taken a beating throughout the 2023 season, and needed the rest. So Simpson watched from the sidelines at Nissan Stadium wearing chains for all of his teammates.\n\nA decision made and a season behind him, Simpson's next task was to coax his mom on a flight to Ft. Lauderdale.\n\n***\n\nSports are full of clich\u00e9s. So there's often a lot of how much a player loves where they are.\n\nYet with Simpson, that's genuine. The proof is in his actions.\n\nSimpson committed to Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn. He played two seasons for him before Malzahn was fired and Auburn hired Bryan Harsin. Simpson stayed. Malzahn was fired in December 2020 and hired by UCF in February 2021. Simpson could have followed him. He stayed.\n\nHe played two years for Harsin, seeing significant increases in his playing time and production. Then Harsin was fired after the 2022 season. And Simpson stayed again to play under Hugh Freeze -- his third coach at Auburn.\n\nWhen they say Simpson loves Auburn, they mean it. In this modern age of transfer portal freedom, Simpson is the antithesis.\n\nIn his time here, Simpson became a fan favorite for his laid-back attitude, high energy on the field and how simply obvious it is that he just likes to have fun.\n\nThere was his creation of the \"turnover seatbelt\" and his now famous press conference quips. Maybe none more so than his \"Plankton Mentality.\"\n\n\"Since I've been knowing Plankton, dude just got one goal, man: get that Krabby Patty formula,\" Simpson said in October. \"He don't stop, no matter what. Every episode, he on it. We got to get that Plankton mentality every game. We got to get that formula every game.\"\n\nHe's referring to the character Plankton from the TV show SpongeBob SquarePants. He's the little green villain always trying to steal the recipe for the Krabby Patty at the Krusty Krab restaurant. And he always fails in some way or another. But he always had another evil plot ready to go next.\n\nFunny, but it's truly got quite a bit of depth to it. Cannon said her son isn't often one to talk a lot. That he'll answer as concisely as possible. It's a more quiet personality sometimes hidden by teaching Freeze how to dance on the sideline.\n\n\"Just keep going, having that Plankton mentality,\" Simpson said. \"Just keep going. Whatever. Doesn't matter. Just don't quit. So I think everybody's just -- things aren't going our way, but we're just, we're going to keep going.\"\n\nPlankton mentality transformed into a full-on bit. Someone photoshopped Plankton wearing an Auburn hat onto a sign and gave it to Simpson to hold at a basketball game.\n\nThat will be part of his legacy here.\n\nHe wants to be remembered for what he'll pass down, too.\n\n\"Especially in our room, man, we tried to drop some gems on them,\" Simpson said of young defensive backs. \"Pregame, any chance we could so we could just leave that room better than we found it.\"\n\n***\n\nSimpson essentially had to force his mother onto the plane. She offered to drive the six hours to Ft. Lauderdale to meet with Crook for the first time. She had never flown before. It scared her. But the pitch to Cannon was relatively simple.\n\n\"Momma, if I get drafted, you're gonna have to get on a plane and come,\" Cannon recalled Simpson telling her.\n\nThe point of the trip was to introduce Simpson's family to the NFL Draft process. It's long, complicated, intense and overwhelming. There is no training for this. There's excitement to be on the forefront of achieving a long-set goal, and uncertainty about where that will happen. In a way, it's not too dissimilar to any other college student leaving school and looking for a first job. But the prospect of the NFL adds a different kind of scrutiny and financial stake.\n\nWhen Simpson's name is called this weekend, his entire life -- his family's entire life -- is going to permanently change. It's not quite as simple as putting on a new hat. It's a dream job, but still real life.\n\nCannon didn't know how the draft worked. So when she got to Crook's office she sat in a room with Simpson and several others from the agency who broke down the steps of this process -- from Simpson's training in Ft. Myers to an appearance at the Senior Bowl then the NFL Combine and Auburn's Pro Day all before the big week finally arrived.\n\nAnd after getting picked, Simpson and Cannon then began to learn about what happens in the first year of a contract, then a second year and so on until a player might be getting ready for the bigger paycheck that comes with a second contract should they be successful in the league.\n\n\"Basically, just so that when they do go in the NFL, not to buy stuff that they don't need,\" Cannon said. \"'Oh, can I afford a Maserati? Yeah, I probably can. But do I need to buy one right now?' No. Don't go over your head.\"\n\nWith the type of money that could be coming in the NFL, Cannon said Simpson's goal is just to be comfortable. She said that since middle school, Simpson told her he wanted to buy her a house when he made it to the NFL. Mathis said buying a house for his mother was the first thing Simpson told Crook he wanted to do with his NFL paycheck.\n\nCrook helps him prepare for interviews with scouts, an arduous session with significant depth. At the Senior Bowl, Simpson was in interviews on several days until close to midnight. NFL scouts somehow know everything, even about a night out at the bars years ago, Cannon said, or asking which of the Auburn defensive backs would be selected first. It was stressful for Simpson, Cannon said, and questions he didn't necessarily want to answer.\n\nAnd Crook guided Simpson on what he'd need to work on to endear himself to scouts. Largely, that was his weight, at least according to some teams. Crook said feedback was confusing. Some teams want Simpson to stay as is, as they liked his film in college at safety. Some suggested changing his position. Others emphasized his need to bulk up. It became difficult to prep with different teams wanting to see different things from Simpson.\n\nSimpson no longer had classes to attend -- but does plan to finish his degree eventually -- so his entire job became football. Mathis said Simpson got up to 183 pounds from his 178 listing on the Auburn roster this season. It's all up from his 162-pound listing as a freshman.\n\n\"A lot of them didn't want me to be in the 170s,\" Simpson said. \"That just needs to go out the window. I got it fixed. It's a pain in the behind, it's hard gaining weight cause I have a fast metabolism. It's really hard to just eat a bunch of meals.\"\n\nThat gain in preparation for the draft comes as a combination of high-calorie intake and weight training programs. Former teammate DJ James said he did a similar program by loading up on pasta meals. Mathis said Simpson was never a heavy eater growing up. Now he has to eat so he can play.\n\n\"I have not asked him what he's eating,\" Mathis joked. \"As long as he's eating, then I don't really care.\"\n\nThe balance is still difficult, as Simpson didn't want to gain weight that could slow him down in the 40-yard dash. He didn't feel worried about that. It's not exactly a simple, let alone normal, job interview.\n\n***\n\nFor a man so laid back, this amount of anxious excitement is like whiplash.\n\nIt was the day before he'd go through on-field drills at the NFL Combine and Simpson had already laid out his workout clothes on the floor of his hotel room.\n\n\"Like it's the first day of school tomorrow,\" Simpson said.\n\nSimpson came to Indianapolis without much of an entourage. This Georgia family passionates hate cold weather, they joke, and it was so cold in Indianapolis that Cannon didn't go, she joked. Simpson got off the plane and quickly went on a hunt for allergy medicine.\n\nAhead of what could be described as a most important job interview, Simpson was ultra-prepared. He could hardly wait any longer to start.\n\nBut maybe this moment was when the reality of how far this football dream had taken him, and how the reality of it all was unfolding in front of him.\n\n\"I still can't believe I'm here,\" Simpson said. \"It's crazy, man. I never thought, I just never thought.\"\n\nHe answered a few more questions at the interview podium, and as he left, the kid still realizing how far he'd come picked up his NFL Combine branded name card and called out a question.\n\nWith so many differing views of him, Simpson had goals for himself at the Combine. So did Crook. So did Mathis. None wanted to share them. That was personal. Simpson felt he had something to show.\n\nSimpson's performance was among the best all-around for safeties in Indianapolis. If the point was to show off his athleticism: point proven.\n\nHis 4.45-second 40-yard dash was fifth among safeties. His 39.5-inch vertical jump was third among safeties. His 11-foot-1-inch broad jump was second among safeties.\n\n\"Really good,\" Crook said in a text. \"Good day all round.\"\n\nThe 39.5-inch broad jump wasn't enough, turns out. Simpson wanted an even 40. He got there at Auburn's Pro Day.\n\nBut back in Indianapolis, he ran down the field after going last in the last drill and flipped into the endzone, and did the same dance he'd taught Freeze back at Auburn. Standing in the middle of the circle of all the other defensive backs in his group, there was Simpson, smiling as ever.\n\nHe belonged.\n\nThere's uncertainty entering the Draft now, beginning Thursday night. He'll watch at home in Georgia, hosting a party on St. Simon's Island just across the causeway from Brunswick.\n\n\"Getting nervous,\" Cannon said in an April text message. \"But all is well.\"\n\nCrook said he thinks Simpson could be picked as high as the second or third round. But more realistically he'll go on the third day. That's the day his party is set for anyway.\n\nSimpson doesn't really care where he ends up. He just sees another goal.\n\nThe Krabby Patty secret formula is still out there.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

All the Way!\"\n\nIn his red-white-and-blue Buffalo Bills uniform, O.J. was bigger than life, lighter than air, untouchable, and invincible.\n\nIt must have been in fourth grade, 1974, that I'd ordered the poster from the Scholastic Book Club through my school.\n\nRemnants of the past easily take on the shape of omens in retrospect. A wide vertical band on the right side of the poster was given to a \"Chart of Official Signals\" -- drawings of a referee making the motions for various football penalties. Next to the Juice running free were small pin-striped figures meting out justice, calling the guilty to account. Off the field, 20 years later, Simpson would be charged with committing two murders, then exonerated. Sometimes judges and juries, like referees, cast a strict eye on the action, sometimes they let the players play.\n\nOther portents seem to pile up as I've been surveying the past in the week since Simpson died at the age of 76 in Las Vegas, site of the most recent Super Bowl, a game he never played in.\n\nIn October of 1972, as O. J. was running towards his first 1,000-yard year in the National Football League, an R&B group called the O'Jays from Canton, Ohio (home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, where a bust of Simpson still resides) was on a roll.\n\nThe O'Jays' biggest hit, which rose to number 1 on the Soul charts and number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1972, was \"Back Stabbers.\" On the night of June 12, 1994 Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman, who'd come by her condo in the Brentwood district of Los Angeles to drop off a pair of sunglasses forgotten by Nicole's mother, were dead.\n\nIn their 1972 appearance on Soul Train, a television broadcast that had begun airing in syndication the year before, the O'Jays performed their big hit dressed in tight-fitting red and gold outfits with matching high-heeled shoes. Their ode to masculine paranoia launches with a long, instrumental introduction (canned on Soul Train), burning as it broods. A jangling minor keyboard chord evokes the blood simmering towards a boil. The thwack of congas involves the same motion as backstabbing and pictures the gesture in sound with a violent, resonant thud. During this soulful, sinister prelude the still-silent singers' choreography features just one synchronized stabbing move. There will be more slashing motions when they sing. The intro culminates in surging strings that presage wounded, predatory manhood whipping itself into action:\n\nThe blades are long, clenched tight in their fists\n\nThough I liked Soul Train, this was not the music that I heard when I looked up at O.J. on my bedroom wall. He moved in my mind to the strains of the NFL Films soundtracks composed by Sam Spence. This consummate symphonist of gridiron drama lorded over an unstoppable playbook that ranged from the foreboding, to the resolute, to the furtive, to the comic: the martial snap of the drum and the gladiatorial blare of trumpets; the high-stepping brass band march; the snarl of electric guitar as the going got tough; the soulful lounge shuffle that offered debonair calm before the last fateful charge; then the glowing string postlude when the battered warriors trudged off the field and into the sonic sunset that shimmered on the horizon even when the rain fell in great curtains that blocked out the sky.\n\nThese musical elements were expertly edited together into an epic Game of the Week or other highlight reel, narrated by the gravelly, men-at-war voice-overs of John Facenda and Harry Kalas.\n\nThough I guess I didn't have my O.J. poster yet, I was glued to the television on December 16, 1973 to watch him break Jim Brown's ten-year-old single-season rushing record, and then bust through the 2,000-yard mark for the first time in NFL history, these milestones were achieved on the snowy wastes of Shea Stadium against Joe Namath's New York Jets. The narrator here is neither Kalas nor Facenda, but Ray Scott, whose voice may be less stentorian, but no less manly, especially when heard along with Spence's multi-movement masterpiece of hypermasculinity that resounds down the decades.\n\nThere was much more music for O.J. over the ensuing years: the light-hearted gambol, unencumbered by football gear, heard to African flutes mingling with European horns in Roots; the cut-backs and stutter-steps of disaster in Towering Inferno enacted to John William's blasts of terror; the goofy hijinks of the Naked Gun series with spoofy motifs of slapstick doom served up by composer Randy Newman as violence was gleefully inflicted on a Black man in accordance with Hollywood tradition; and always, O.J. hurdling through airports on the way to get his rental car to the sexy strains of the James Bond rip-off, \"Nobody does it better ... than Hertz the Superstar.\" These caperings look and sound very different in light of O.J.'s crimes.\n\nI was living in Los Angeles during the 1994-95 Simpson murder trial, and I followed the proceedings obsessively. The CNN coverage began with dread musical tropes taken from English composer Paul Floss's \"World Conflict.\" As the throttling music made violently clear, there was no bigger news than O.J. This was not NFL Films' musical take on the elegant, elusive running back, but video-game fare of a murderer confined in the courtroom and soon to be condemned.\n\nJust before the trial ended, I'd moved to Upstate New York. I had no television and no access to the internet, so I went around the corner to the town's dive bar that Tuesday in early October just before 1pm Eastern Time, since the verdict was due at 10am in Los Angeles. A big Buffalo Bills banner was spread across the back wall, and many of the broken-down patrons seated at the bar wore Bills jerseys or coats. I'm sure they had all followed Simpson's NFL heroics when he'd been playing a couple hours away in Buffalo back in the 1970s. We watched on CNN, Floss's soundtrack doing its best to animate the Chanticleer clientele, though with little sign of success. The doors were open and a policeman strolled in to catch the result. After the verdict was read, he said, \"I guess the dog did it,\" and walked out into the afternoon's bright sunshine.\n\nAmong the wreckage of Simpson's last 30 years, one can, if so inclined, sift out bizarre bits of junk like his rap song from 2006 -- a medley of boasts about past football deeds (he still has the record for most 200+ yard games) and ladies-man innuendos.\n\nNo mention of football or murder is made in what I consider the towering musical monument to Simpson erected in 2017: Jay-Z's \"Story of O.J.\" I cannot find its refrain -- \"I'm not Black, I'm O.J.\" -- anywhere before this song engraved his epitaph in sound seven years before his death. O.J. tried to run free of it all, first on the field, then for those hours in the white Ford Bronco of his boyhood friend and Bills teammate, Al Cowling. Jay-Z keeps O.J. defiant, even now after his death, and even in the face of the song's skeptical \"Okay\" that answers the lyric's stiff-arm of race.\n\nJay-Z doesn't hand O.J. the football, but I can see the Juice running down the field in slow motion to this groove and its litanies of aspiration, greed, slavery and skin.\n\nI kept the O.J. poster up on my bedroom wall until my last year of high school. Why I took it down I can't remember. Probably I felt I'd at last outgrown the vestiges of elementary school. I was getting ready to leave home. Far from there now, I still see O.J. floating above, ready to take off.\n\n(David Yearsley is a long-time contributor to CounterPunch and the Anderson Valley Advertiser.

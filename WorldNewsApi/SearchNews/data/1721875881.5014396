Four months earlier, his supporters had ransacked the Capitol. He had departed Washington, disgraced, defeated and twice impeached. His party had abandoned him, however temporarily, and he had been kicked off his social media accounts. He holed up inside Trump Tower and stewed. An entertainment journalist named Ramin Setoodeh came knocking. He told Trump he wanted to write a book, not about the unpleasantness of the previous four years, but about that prelapsarian period before Trump entered politics. Then, he was merely the star of The Apprentice, a reality TV show that aired on NBC beginning in 2004 and \u201cchanged television\u201d, as Setoodeh put it to the former president. Trump was sold. He granted the reporter several long, recorded interviews. \u201cHe was at his lowest then,\u201d Setoodeh, 42, said over lunch in Manhattan\u2019s West Village on Friday. \u201cI think talking about The Apprentice allowed him to feel comfort.\u201d Trump became so excited about the book that he offered to promote it at his rallies, saying that the merchants who follow his travelling roadshow would help peddle it. \u201cYou\u2019ll sell 10,000 books at one rally,\u201d he told Setoodeh. \u201cLet\u2019s see how this works out.\u201d", "summary": "Disgraced, defeated and twice impeached.

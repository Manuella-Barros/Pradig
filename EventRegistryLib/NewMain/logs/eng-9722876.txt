But it would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.\"\n\nRepublicans have couched the bill in Trump-like apocalyptic rhetoric.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson claimed in a floor speech ahead of the vote that failure to support the bill would \"hand over our country to illegal aliens, cartel traffickers, and violent criminals and murderers.\"\n\nTrump, who favors the bill, continues to repeat false claims that the 2020 election was stolen through massive voter fraud.\n\nJohnson, who relied on Trump's support to hold off a bid to oust him from leadership by Republican hardliner Marjorie Taylor Greene, unveiled plans for the legislation during an April joint press conference with the former president in Florida.\n\nJohnson and other Republicans have gone so far as to allege that Democrats are actively encouraging non-citizens to vote.\n\n\"For all the hysterical rhetoric ... Republicans have one real purpose here: to continue to erode the confidence of Americans in our election system,\" said Representative Joe Morelle, top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, which oversees election policy.\n\nJohnson and other Republicans have cited data showing non-citizens are registered to vote in some states and point to municipalities, including New York City, Washington, D.C., and Montpelier, Vermont, that have allowed resident aliens to vote in some local elections.\n\nRepublicans also rely in part on a widely rejected 2014 study that claimed to show a level of noncitizen voting capable of swaying congressional and presidential elections. Trump used the study to support his claim that Democrat Hillary Clinton won the popular vote in the 2016 presidential election because of illegal ballots cast by non-citizens.\n\n\"This is a scare tactic,\" said Wendy Weiser, who directs the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \"Non-citizens cannot vote in U.S. elections. There are multiple layers of protections in place, including it being a crime under federal and state law.\"\n\nA Brennan Center study examined 42 jurisdictions, accounting for 23.5 million votes in the 2016 presidential election, and found only 30 incidents of possible non-citizen voting, or 0.0001% of votes cast.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Scott Malone, Christian Schmollinger and Aurora Ellis)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voter registration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alien (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elections in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter suppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Morelle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph D.

House Speaker Mike Johnson and other supporters argue the bill is necessary to prevent illegal voting and bolster election integrity, despite studies and experts indicating that non-citizen voting is exceedingly rare.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elections in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voter registration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voter suppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/04_06_2024_21_23_57_5560648.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722876", "eventUri": "eng-9722876", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), Vicente Gonzalez (D-Texas), Jared Golden (D-Maine) and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.).\n\nAt least 198 Democrats opposed the measure, and no Republicans.\n\nIt's illegal for non-US citizens to vote in federal elections, but that hasn't stopped hundreds from doing so, state and federal investigations have shown, and thousands from attempting to do so.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) whipped his caucus in opposition to what he called an \"extreme MAGA Republican voter suppression bill,\" before inaccurately stating: \"There is no evidence that has been presented to suggest that undocumented individuals have been participating in federal elections.\"\n\nThe White House also issued a veto threat against the legislation on Monday.\n\n\"It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in Federal elections -- it is a Federal crime punishable by prison and fines,\" the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a statement.\n\n\"Additionally, making a false claim of citizenship or unlawfully voting in an election is punishable by removal from the United States and a permanent bar to admission,\" the statement also reads.\n\n\"This bill would do nothing to safeguard our elections, but it would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.\"\n\nLeft-of-center groups like the Campaign Legal Center have further dismissed concerns about the loophole in registration being able to sway elections, but conservatives have remained unconvinced.\n\nRep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who introduced the bill, told The Post and other reporters on Tuesday that the claims it would disenfranchise US voters were \"hogwash.\"\n\n\"We've seen that Democrats are now trying to abuse this,\" Roy said. \"And you've got, you know, in Oakland, and San Francisco and New York and D.C. and all across the country -- Democrats are pushing to allow non-citizens to vote.\"\n\n\"They say -- wink, wink -- 'Only in state and local elections,'\" he suggested.\n\nJohnson's office released a 21-page white paper on the legislation in June, urging Congress to pass it and thwart potential \"foreign election interference\" as a result of the record-breaking 6.4 million immigrants who have entered the US and taken up residence since President Biden took office in January 2021.\n\nThe paper references another effort by Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Texas) last year to introduce legislation that would provide mass amnesty to migrants -- even those who have illegally voted in past elections.\n\n\"We have so many non-citizens in the country right now that if only one out of 100 of those illegal aliens voted, you're talking about hundreds of thousands of votes being cast,\" Johnson warned in his floor speech, adding that the number could \"determine the future of this great Republic.\"\n\n\"As our dear friend, congresswoman [Mariannette] Miller-Meeks will tell you she won her election in 2020 by six votes,\" he pointed out, referring to the Iowa Republican's narrow win over Democrat Rita Hart that year.\n\nIn the position paper, Johnson's staff also pointed to an academic study that found non-citizen voter participation \"has been large enough to change meaningful election outcomes including Electoral College votes, and Congressional elections.\"\n\nIf the same rate of non-citizen voter participation occurs in November, the paper claims it would be \"sufficient enough to determine the outcome of the 2024 Presidential election.\"\n\nHans von Spakovsky, a former member of the Federal Election Commission and manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation, told The Post last month that it was \"difficult to predict the actual numbers of aliens that may vote because so many states do absolutely nothing to verify the citizenship of registered voters.\"\n\nThe bill would help that by cleaning up voter rolls in US states by verifying people through federal databases at the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration.\n\nVoter rolls have been shown through audits in recent years to contain thousands of non-citizens -- including the swing-states of Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\nUnder the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) and welfare offices nationwide are required to hand over voter registration forms in at least 46 states along with applications for driver's licenses and federal benefit programs.\n\nIn filling out the federal form, would-be voters only have to make a signed attestation of their citizenship, and in some states must also provide a driver's license number or the last four digits of their social security number.\n\nOnly three US states -- Tennessee, Virginia and New Mexico -- ask for the full social security number.\n\nMeanwhile, the Biden administration has expanded access to health care and other federal benefit packages like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, putting more migrants within reach of the forms.\n\nIt has also provided avenues for asylum seekers, parolees and foreigners present in the US on work visas to obtain social security numbers.\n\nAdditionally, 19 states and Washington, D.C., allow non-citizens to receive driver's licenses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a move that Biden supported as a presidential candidate in 2020.\n\n\"Perhaps the Democrat Party would prefer that we only identify fraudulent voters after the fact but after an election has already decided and the new members are sworn in,\" Johnson said before the vote. \"That's not acceptable. That doesn't instill trust. It doesn't ensure the integrity of the system.\"\n\n\"Because the Democratic Party has shown time and time again that they want our borders wide open to every country on the planet, and that they want illegal aliens voting in our elections, we now have reached a fateful decision point,\" Johnson concluded.\n\n\"Since our elections are so razor thin, it's not just our physical safety of our communities that are in jeopardy, it's also the integrity of the ballot box.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Another 198 Democrats voted against the legislation. Four other Republicans and 10 Democrats did not vote.\n\n\"Today 198 House Democrats voted against preventing illegal aliens from voting in American elections,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said in a statement after the legislation passed, adding later, \"House Democrats have now proven they believe that illegal aliens should vote in American elections.\"\n\nThe Democrats who broke ranks to back the bill, which former President Donald Trump had endorsed while saying it would prevent Democrats from cheating in the election process, included Henry Cuellar (TX), Donald Davis (NC), Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (WA), Jared Golden (ME), and Vicente Gonzalez (TX).\n\nAxios reported House Democrat leaders had urged their peers to oppose the bill, claiming it would create an \"extreme burden for countless Americans,\" make a passport the \"only acceptable standalone form of identification,\" and \"further intimidate election officials and overburden states' abilities to enroll new voters.\"\n\nWhile some municipalities in a few states and Washington, D.C., allow non-citizens to vote in local elections, evidence shows there have been multiple instances noncitizens on voter rolls in various states where it is not permitted, as noted in a report that was released by Johnson's office in vouching for the SAVE Act.\n\nThe report also warned of a National Voter Registration Act \"loophole.\" This federal law \"does not require states to ask for proof of citizenship when registering an individual to vote in federal elections,\" but rather \"relies on individuals to merely attest they are a citizen and eligible to vote,\" the report explained.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has already formally rejected the SAVE Act. A policy statement from his administration said it is currently illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections and claimed that states \"already have effective safeguards in place to verify voters' eligibility and maintain the accuracy of voter rolls.\"\n\nIt added states have \"effective safeguards ... to verify voters' eligibility and maintain the accuracy of voter rolls\" ... and the bill does \"noting to safeguard our elections, but it would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged from voter rolls.\"\n\nThe Save Act faces long odds of becoming federal law with the current power makeup in Washington. While Republicans lead the House, Democrats control the Senate. But that reality did not stop Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), the lawmaker who introduced the legislation, from putting the upper chamber on notice.\n\n\"We will only be able to keep this republic as a republic as long as our citizenship as Americans remains meaningful,\" Roy said in a statement posted line, adding later, \"We must push forward, pressure the Senate, and keep up the fight for what makes this country great and what it

It has the strong backing of Donald Trump who urged the House to pass it, or else 'go home and cry yourself to sleep.'\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson insisted legislation to make voters prove their citizenship could be one of the 'most important' bills to go through Congress in a lifetime.\n\n'This will be one of the most important votes that members of this chamber will ever take in their entire careers,' he said on the House floor Wednesday.\n\n'And it's an issue we never thought we would have to actually address, but that moment has come to us now,' he added.\n\nInterestingly, five Democrats helped get the bill across the finish line in the House 221-198. But it faces a certain death in the Democrat-controlled Senate and President Biden has also threatened to veto the legislation.\n\nMigrants walk through the Chihuahua Desert in Juarez, Mexico, on July 5, 2024\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, flanked by Rep. Chip Roy, insisted legislation to make voters prove their citizenship could be one of the 'most important' bills to go through Congress in a lifetime\n\nThe speaker added: 'Should Americans and Americans alone determine the outcome of American elections? Or should we allow foreigners and illegal aliens to decide who sits in the White House and in the People's House and in the Senate?'\n\nMost voting ballots require some kind of proof of identity to register to vote, such as a driver's license. Not all of those proofs of ID require citizenship - the bill would specifically require ID requirements like passports or birth certificates.\n\nA sampling from 2002 to 2022 of over 1 billion ballots found fewer than 100 cases of voter fraud.\n\nDemocrat Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., said the bill is an 'overt effort' to 'make Americans believe elections are rife with faud,' calling it a 'scare tactic.'\n\nRead More Speaker Mike Johnson teams up with Trump immigration hawk Stephen Miller and others to preserve election integrity\n\nJohnson joined Trump world heavyweights Stephen Miller and Hogan Gidley and Rep. Chip Roy to get the legislation across the finish line in the House.\n\nThe speaker previously couldn't disclose the exact number of non-citizens who have voted in elections, but had warned the number could be 'dangerously high.'\n\n'We all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections. But it's not been something that is easily provable. We don't have that number. This legislation will allow us to do exactly that,' he said at a press event in May.\n\nNon-citizens who vote in federal and state elections are already breaking the law and putting themselves at risk of jail or deportation. A small handful of municipalities in California, Maryland and Vermont allow illegal immigrants to vote in local elections.\n\nBut federal law currently prohibits requiring documentary proof of citizenship in federal elections. Arizona requires it for state elections.\n\nA migrant walks through the Chihuahua Desert in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico\n\n'We now have so many non citizens in the country that if only one out of a hundred of those voted, they would cast hundreds of thousands of votes,' Johnson told reporters. 'This is a dangerously high number'\n\n'If a nefarious actor wants to intervene in our elections, all they have to do is check a box on a form and sign their name. That's it. That's all that's required,' Johnson said.\n\nMiller, the architect of Trump's immigration policy, called the bill the 'most important vote that most members of Congress take in their entire careers.'\n\n'If this bill does not become law then Joe Biden and Democrats will have engineered, one of the greatest interferences in any democratic nation in the history of the world.'\n\nThe bill would aim to close any loopholes that allow people to register to vote without proof of US citizenship or photo ID, require all 50 states to remove any unlawful immigrants from their voter rolls, add penalties of up to five years in prison for election officials who register non-citizens to vote and require proof of citizenship for those who vote overseas.\n\nMiller, the architect of Trump's immigration policy, called the bill the 'most important vote that most members of Congress take in their entire careers'\n\nThere's little evidence that non-citizen voting is impacting election outcomes, and unlawful immigrants often steer clear of giving out personal information for fear or being caught by immigration authorities.\n\nIt is possible to vote illegally as an undocumented immigrant, though.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Roy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chip Roy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Miller_(political_advisor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Miller (political advisor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahuan_Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chihuahuan Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Ju\u00e1rez", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogan_Gidley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hogan Gidley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Morelle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph D.

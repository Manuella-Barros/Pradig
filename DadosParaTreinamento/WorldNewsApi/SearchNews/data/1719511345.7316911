Devoted followers of the hit dating programme will recall the blonde beauty from her 2020 villa entrance. The mum-of-one has now opened up about her Love Island experience, motherhood, and Celebration Day. When quizzed about how she has adapted to her newfound fame post-villa, the 30-year-old star revealed her fans have been nothing short of supportive. However, this hasn't deterred them from asking for selfies in the most unexpected places including inside HRH's prison. She confessed: \"That has actually happened once, and it was probably the most mortifying day of my life. You just go with it, but yeah, that was very shocking. In terms of where my most strangest pictures have been taken, [prison] is definitely up there.\" \"But I mean, I've never once actually said no to have a picture being taken because I just think I'd be nowhere without people that know me and like me and listen to my podcasts and interact with things that I do. So I'm always happy to have pictures with people,\" she told the Daily Star. The TV star revealed a rather awkward encounter during her visit to see ex-boyfriend Billy Webb in prison, with whom she shares her one year old daughter Lucia. Webb was locked up for nine months last November after a drugs bust. On her Oh Baby podcast, she recounted: \"So obviously they get the newspapers and stuff in there and so when it's been in the papers, people are like, 'Oh s**t! This is you'.\" She described the bizarre experience of being recognised by prison staff: \"What's weird though is when I've gone to visits and I'm with Lucia and some of the prison guards are like, 'Oh my God! You're from Love Island' or 'Oh my God, I follow you on Instagram '. And I'm just like, 'Someone help me. Why am I here?\" Shaughna shared how she's even been asked for selfies while visiting: \"I've been stopped for selfies in there, it's f***ing mad. But no matter about all the selfies and it's really cringey and I really don't enjoy it.\" Despite the discomfort, Shaughna emphasised her daughter's needs: \"However, I'll always do what's best for my baby, like my baby deserves to see her dad, so I would always put myself in uncomfortable positions for the sake of that.\" She stressed the importance of her daughter having a strong bond with her father. The conversation took a poignant turn as Shaughna reflected on her late father, who passed away when she was just 22: \"I will be celebrating my dad Eddie, he passed away in 2016. It's crazy, it feels like it's been a lifetime and also it feels like it was yesterday but it's really important for me to celebrate him. He was my dad and he would be to my daughter her grandad and I want to kind of keep his memory going. I don't wait it to be like he passed away and that's it now because he's a person to me and I don't want these memories to be forgotten.\" In memory of her father, the Love Island sweetheart didn't hold back on creating a commemorative tribute that holds close to both their hearts. Continuing her story, she said, \"Me and my dad were big Arsenal fans and I followed in his footsteps. So when I came out of Love Island, I bought my dad a plaque at the castle grounds and that should be there for a minimum of 10 years. When Lucia saw it for the first time, her reaction was priceless. I plan to visit it with her on every Celebration Day. It's a special place where we can remember my dad, who would have undoubtedly cherished it.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.", "summary": "Love Island star Shaughna Phillips has opened up about one of her most awkward encounters with a fan, recalling the time she was asked for a selfie while inside a prison", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/itv-love-island-star-left-32897338", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32838863.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_ITV-Plc.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:56:39", "author": "Bethany Whittingham,Susan Knox", "authors": ["Bethany Whittingham", "Susan Knox"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.14}

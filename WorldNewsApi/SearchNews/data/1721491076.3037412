Mostly Christian militias fought back. A 2019 peace deal did not end the fighting, and six of the 14 armed groups that signed later quit the agreement. The Coalition of Patriots for Change, an alliance of rebel groups aligned with Bozize, was founded in the aftermath of the agreement, but the experts cited no progress and the splintering of some rebel groups. Mercenaries from Russia\u2019s Wagner group along with Russian military instructors have been working in the Central African Republic at the government\u2019s request. The experts said that on Dec. 10, 2023, six waves of explosions were heard at the Russian instructors\u2019 base in Kaga Bandoro in the west of the country, and three instructors were killed and seven people injured. They said the attack appeared to be in response to an assault three days earlier by the country\u2019s military and Russian instructors on fighters from the UPC rebel group at the Bara mining site. A dozen UPC fighters were reportedly killed and 30 captured, the experts said in the report, which was released Friday.", "summary": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) &#8212; Activities of armed groups in the volatile Central African Republic have increased, complicating a security landscape that has seen a spillover of the conflict in neighboring Sudan, U.N. experts warn in a new report.

The swimmers were found to have \"consistently very low levels\" of the drug, WADA said.\n\nTMZ was the medication at the centre of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics doping scandal involving teenage Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva. She was banned for four years in January.\n\n- 'No winners here' -\n\nThe New York Times, which together with German broadcaster ARD first reported the 23 failed tests, then said in June that three of those had also tested positive for another banned substance years earlier.\n\nChinese authorities argued the three had ingested the substance inadvertently through contaminated meat, and no disciplinary action was taken.\n\nWADA said the trio were found to have levels of clenbuterol which were between \"six and 50 times lower\" than the minimum reporting level currently used by the agency.\n\nFollowing the initial furore in April, WADA -- which has come under fierce criticism in some quarters -- ordered an independent review into its handling of the case of the 23.\n\n\"This is a huge mess and one largely of WADA's own making,\" anti-doping expert April Henning, from Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University, told AFP.\n\nThe scandal affects not just WADA but other athletes and governing bodies, as well as \"the Chinese swimmers in this case who will now forever be labelled as dopers even if there truly was a contamination issue\", said Henning.\n\n\"There are no winners here.\"\n\nChina has consistently denied there was any intention to cheat and railed against \"fake news\".\n\nSome Chinese media have presented the story as an American-led plot to discredit the country and its team.\n\n- Medal contenders -\n\nZhang Yufei was one of the swimmers alleged by The New York Times and ARD to have been among the 23.\n\nThe 26-year-old, one of China's biggest stars, won two golds in Tokyo and the so-called \"butterfly queen\" will again be in contention for medals in Paris.\n\nShe told AFP in May that her aim for the Olympics was to \"surpass my past self\".\n\nIn written answers to questions posed before the positive tests came to light, Zhang said winning the 200m butterfly in Tokyo and the medal ceremony afterwards were \"the most precious moments in my life\".\n\nAFP tried to contact Zhang and the Chinese Swimming Association several times since the controversy erupted but neither replied to the questions put to them.\n\nChina's 31-member swim squad also boasts several others who will seriously challenge for medals in Paris but have questions hanging over them.\n\nAlso alleged to have been among the 23 and set to compete in Paris are Wang Shun, the 200m medley gold medallist in Tokyo.\n\nThere is also Qin Haiyang, a breaststroke multiple world champion and the 200m record-holder.\n\nChina's best-known swimmer, the three-time Olympic gold medallist Sun Yang, will not be in Paris -- he is only just back from suspension for an anti-doping violation of his own, the second of his career.\n\nreb/pst\n\nMore from this

Their message doesn't stray too far from Henning's own and other opinions back in Europe either, basically stating that the global watchdog shot itself in the foot on this issue.\n\n\"There are no winners here: this is a huge mess and one largely of WADA's own making,\" the anti-doping expert from Edinburgh's Heriot-Watt University told AFP as the scandal has permeated, not only affecting the agency but other athletes and governing bodies including \"the Chinese swimmers in this case who will now forever be labelled as dopers even if there truly was a contamination issue.\"\n\nChina has consistently denied there was any intention to cheat and railed against \"fake news\" while some local media have presented the story as an American-led plot to discredit the country and its team, which will head to the Paris Olympics under fierce scrutiny with 11 of the squad among a group who tested positive for the banned substance in the lead-up to the Tokyo Games.\n\nBoth WADA and Chinese officials repeatedly attacked The New York Times' reporting of the case and the Asian country then went on to select 11 suspect swimmers to participate in the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics; the decision worsened the matter, leading up to a US Congressional hearing where swimming icons like Michael Phelps called out the global policing body and politicians demanded answers from the national agency supposed to supervise the cheaters.\n\nSwimming is always one of the most eagerly anticipated events and along with the United States and Australia, China is expected to be among the medals when the Games begin on 26 July. Any success will face immediate questions, however, after the April revelations. 11 of those 23 that will compete in the French capital make up a third of China's swim team. TMZ is a prescription heart medication but it is banned in athletes because it can enhance performance. The swimmers were found to have \"consistently very low levels\" of the drug, WADA said. It was also the medication at the centre of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics doping scandal involving teenage Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva. She was banned for four years in January.\n\nThe New York Times, which together with German broadcaster ARD first reported the 23 failed tests, then said in June that three of those had also tested positive for another banned substance years earlier. Chinese authorities argued the three had ingested the substance inadvertently through contaminated meat, and no disciplinary action was taken. WADA said the trio were found to have levels of clenbuterol which were between \"six and 50 times lower\" than the minimum reporting level currently used by the agency.\n\nZhang Yufei was one of the swimmers alleged by The New York Times and ARD to have been among the 23. The 26-year-old, one of China's biggest stars, won two golds in Tokyo and the so-called \"butterfly queen\" will again be in contention for medals in Paris. She told AFP in May that her aim for the Olympics was to \"surpass my past self\".\n\nIn written answers to questions posed before the positive tests came to light, Zhang said winning the 200m butterfly in Tokyo and the medal ceremony afterwards were \"the most precious moments in my life\". AFP tried to contact Zhang and the Chinese Swimming Association several times since the controversy erupted but neither replied to the questions put to them.\n\nChina's 31-member swim squad also boasts several others who will seriously challenge for medals in Paris but have questions hanging over them. Also alleged to have been among the 23 and set to compete in Paris are Wang Shun, the 200m medley gold medallist in Tokyo. There is also Qin Haiyang, a breaststroke multiple world champion and the 200m record-holder.\n\nChina's best-known swimmer, the three-time Olympic gold medallist Sun Yang, will not be in Paris -- he is only just back from suspension for an anti-doping violation of his own, the second of his career.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"},

The FBI didn't immediately return requests for comment.\n\nThe Chinese swimmers case could become the highest-profile use so far of a U.S. federal law passed in 2020 in fallout from the long-running scandal of Russian state-backed doping in sports.\n\nThe 23 swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine in January 2021 and were filed weeks later in the global anti-doping database.\n\nA later investigation by Chinese state authorities said traces of the substance were found in the kitchen of a hotel where the team stayed. No explanation has been given about how and why the drug prescribed in pill form got there.\n\nWADA accepted the theory which allowed the Chinese swimmers to continue to compete, and has since described it as \"a relatively straightforward case of mass contamination.\"\n\nThe agency has since defended its handling of the case that was kept secret in 2021, saying it had no way to independently disprove the theory during the COVID-19 pandemic when travel to China was not possible.\n\nLawyers for WADA said in April this year they did not have evidence to win separate appeals against the 23 swimmers before the Tokyo Olympics.

Any appeals seeking suspensions for the swimmers would have been heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, where Nowicki was a long-time senior counsel before joining World Aquatics in 2021.\n\n\"This scandal raises serious legal, ethical, and competitive concerns and may constitute a broader state-sponsored strategy by the People's Republic of China to unfairly compete at the Olympic Games in ways Russia has previously done,\" the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party said in the letter to the Justice Department and FBI.\n\nThe case was also raised at a congressional hearing last month in which swimming great Michael Phelps said athletes have lost faith in WADA as the global watchdog trying to keep cheaters out of sports.\n\nOfficials from the Montreal-based agency declined an invitation to come to the hearing, saying it would be \"inappropriate to be pulled into a political debate before a U.S. congressional committee regarding a case from a different country, especially while an independent review into WADA's handling of the case is ongoing.\"\n\nThat review report is pending from a WADA-appointed former public prosecutor in the Swiss canton of Vaud that is home to the International Olympic Committee and governing bodies of many Olympic sports.\n\nU.S. Anti-Doping Agency chief executive Travis Tygart suggested to The Associated Press an ongoing federal investigation could make sport officials traveling to the U.S. \"fearful that they may have to answer questions about their activities from the FBI.\"\n\nThe U.S. will host the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles, and in Paris on July 24 the IOC should confirm Salt Lake City as host for the 2034 Winter Games.\n\nThe Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named for a whistleblower who exposed Russian state-backed doping, passed with bipartisan backing. It received broad support from the global sports world for its aims to criminalize doping.\n\nHowever, WADA lobbied against what it saw as a risk of overreach from the \"extraterritorial\" jurisdiction it could give to U.S. federal agencies, and the IOC also voiced concerns.\n\nThe Rodchenkov Act, Tygart said, \"was enacted in 2021 with broad athlete, sport and multinational governmental support because WADA could not be trusted to be a strong, fair global watchdog to protect clean athletes and fair sport.\"", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news",

WADA, which launched an investigation after the news broke, has come under heavy criticism over its handling of the case, including being slammed at a U.S. Congressional Hearing that was led by United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) CEO Travis Tygart and included swimmers Michael Phelps and Allison Schmitt testifying.\n\nEleven of the swimmers who tested positive in 2021 are set to compete at the Paris Olympics, which begin in just over three weeks.

The FBI didn't immediately return requests for comment.\n\nThe Chinese swimmers case could become the highest-profile use so far of a U.S. federal law passed in 2020 in fallout from the long-running scandal of Russian state-backed doping in sports.\n\nThe 23 swimmers tested positive for trimetazidine in January 2021 and were filed weeks later in the global anti-doping database.\n\nA later investigation by Chinese state authorities said traces of the substance were found in the kitchen of a hotel where the team stayed. No explanation has been given about how and why the drug prescribed in pill form got there.\n\nWADA accepted the theory which allowed the Chinese swimmers to continue to compete, and has since described it as \"a relatively straightforward case of mass contamination.\"\n\nThe agency has since defended its handling of the case that was kept secret in 2021, saying it had no way to independently disprove the theory during the COVID-19 pandemic when travel to China was not possible.\n\nLawyers for WADA said in April this year they did not have evidence to win separate appeals against the 23 swimmers before the Tokyo Olympics. Any appeals seeking suspensions for the swimmers would have been heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, where Nowicki was a long-time senior counsel before joining World Aquatics in 2021.\n\n\"This scandal raises serious legal, ethical, and competitive concerns and may constitute a broader state-sponsored strategy by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to unfairly compete at the Olympic Games in ways Russia has previously done,\" the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party said in the letter to the Justice Department and FBI.\n\nThe case was also raised at a congressional hearing last month in which swimming great Michael Phelps said athletes have lost faith in WADA as the global watchdog trying to keep cheaters out of sports.\n\nOfficials from the Montreal-based agency declined an invitation to come to the hearing, saying it would be \"inappropriate to be pulled into a political debate before a U.S. congressional committee regarding a case from a different country, especially while an independent review into WADA's handling of the case is ongoing.\"\n\nThat review report is pending from a WADA-appointed former public prosecutor in the Swiss canton of Vaud that is home to the International Olympic Committee and governing bodies of many Olympic sports.\n\nU.S. Anti-Doping Agency chief executive Travis Tygart suggested to The Associated Press an ongoing federal investigation could make sport officials traveling to the U.S. \"fearful that they may have to answer questions about their activities from the FBI.\"\n\nThe U.S. will host the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles, and in Paris on July 24 the IOC should confirm Salt Lake City as host for the 2034 Winter Games.\n\nThe Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named for a whistleblower who exposed Russian state-backed doping, passed with bipartisan backing. It received broad support from the global sports world for its aims to criminalize doping.\n\nHowever, WADA lobbied against what it saw as risk of overreach from the \"extraterritorial\" jurisdiction it could give to U.S. federal agencies, and the IOC also voiced concerns.\n\nThe Rodchenkov Act, Tygart said, \"was enacted in 2021 with broad athlete, sport and multinational governmental support because WADA could not be trusted to be a strong, fair global watchdog to protect clean athletes and fair sport.\" (AP) AM", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"},

Three weeks before 10,500 of the world's best athletes from 184 countries gather in Paris, the finger is being pointed at the Chinese swimmers, and not, it appears, without good reason.\n\nIt has emerged that in early 2021, seven months before the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Olympics, 23 of China's best swimmers tested positive for the same banned drug, trimetazidine (TMZ), at a domestic meeting in Shijiazhuang, south of Beijing.\n\nAfter being investigated by China's own anti-doping authority, the swimmers escaped any sanction after it was decided they'd all been contaminated by traces of TMZ in the hotel kitchen. This finding was then accepted by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and World Aquatics, neither of whom made the matter public.\n\nSeveral of the swimmers involved went on to win medals in Tokyo, including three gold, and last month 11 of those same 23 Chinese swimmers were named on their team for Paris, including Zhang Yufei, who won Tokyo gold in the 200m butterfly and the women's 4x200m freestyle relay, and two silver medals.\n\nAlso on the list for Paris is men's 200m individual medley Olympic gold medallist Wang Shun, 200m breaststroke world-record holder Qin Haiyan, and Yu Yiting, who earlier this year won World Championship bronze in the women's 200m individual medley, one of the events in Paris where Ireland's Ellen Walsh will be competing.\n\nFrom January 1st-3rd, 2021, 23 swimmers from the 39-strong Chinese team tested positive for TMZ while competing in the Chinese city of Shijiazhuang, and staying in a local hotel.\n\nThe subsequent Chinese investigation blamed food and environmental contamination, accepting that the banned drug had got into spice containers in the hotel kitchen as well as various air vents.\n\nWada accepted this explanation, saying it was not possible to send its own investigators to China during the pandemic. It also noted in the case of the Chinese swimmers, \"the contamination scenario was plausible and that there was no concrete scientific element to challenge it\".\n\nIn April of this year, following a series of leaked emails, the New York Times and German broadcaster ARD broke the story, prompting immediate criticism of Wada, the Chinese anti-doping authority and World Aquatics, who had also, in 2021, decided not to press the matter any further.\n\nAccording to Wada, environmental contamination was the likely cause, and they chose not to pursue it as an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV), despite previous high-profile cases of TMZ positives in Chinese swimming, including Sun Yang, the 2012 Olympic 1,500m champion who was suspended for three months in 2014 after testing positive for the substance. He also served a four-year suspension for a separate doping violation.\n\nTravis Tygart, the head of US Anti-doping, called that decision a \"stab in the back to clean athletes\" and raised concerns about a potential cover-up.\n\nWada hasn't yet published the full reasoned decision behind its acceptance of the contamination claims, which could have at least resulted in a provisional suspension and full disclosure at the time.\n\nOnly available by prescription in pill or powder form, TMZ is designed to prevent angina attacks, and is also used in the treatment of heart disease. Listed as a \"metabolic modulator\", it is banned by Wada in competition and out of competition, known to help endurance and recovery time after training, and not something usually found lying around any kitchen.\n\nWada did note it didn't agree with all aspects of China's finding into the TMZ positives, \"for largely technical reasons\", but ultimately accepted the contamination theory because the levels of TMZ were low and the swimmers were from different regions of China; while in another team hotel, no swimmers tested positive.\n\nNot really. Although Wada said its rules provide for a \"mandatory provisional suspension\" for \"so-called non-specified substances such as TMZ\", it went on to say \"even for mandatory provisional suspensions, there are exceptions, one of which is specific to cases of likely contamination\".\n\nWada has also appointed retired Swiss prosecutor Eric Cottier to review the handling of the case, promising that report before the Games begin. It has also accused the US of \"politicising\" the matter by repeatedly pointing the finger at China only.\n\nLast week at a US House Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, titled Examining Anti-Doping Measures in Advance of the 2024 Olympics, Phelps, who won a record 23 gold medals in swimming, said he had lost faith in Wada.\n\n\"It is clear to me that any attempts of reform at Wada have fallen short, and there are still deeply rooted systemic problems that prove detrimental to the integrity of international sports and athletes' right to fair competition, time and time again.\"\n\nSchmitt, who was part of the US team that lost of to China in the medley relay in Tokyo, added: \"Learning that the Chinese relay consisted of athletes who had not served a suspension, I look back with doubt. I plead, on behalf of US athletes: hold Wada and the global anti-doping system accountable.\"\n\nDaniel Wiffen, one of the favourites to win a medal in the 800m and 1,500m freestyle, having won world championship gold in February, told The Irish Times this week: \"All I can say is they [the Chinese] don't really swim my events. So it doesn't really affect me that much, my events. But I'm there to swim for myself, and my country, and only have time to think about myself.\"\n\nPhelps, however, was speaking for a lot of Olympic swimmers when he said several \"close friends\" had been potentially affected by the decision to allow the Chinese swimmers who failed tests in 2021 compete in Tokyo.\n\n\"Many of them will live with the 'what ifs' for the rest of their lives.\"\n\nWhich begs the question: what if more Chinese swimmers win medals in Paris?", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [],

A country where corruption is rife will be particularly tested.\n\nThose who reach the podium or break records are systematically tested.\n\nIn all, the ITA expects to test some 4,000 of the 10,000 athletes present. The anti-doping authorities maintain that it is pointless testing everyone, saying it is better to target the tests.\n\nChinese swimmers, who were at the centre of revelations by German television channel ARD and the New York Times that they tested positive before the Tokyo Olympics without being punished, are being tested and monitored closely, according to an anti-doping source.\n\n300 controllers and 800 chaperones\n\nMore than 300 doping control officers, a third of whom are French, will be deployed to collect the urine and blood samples: they will be coordinated by the French Anti-Doping Agency (AFLD).\n\nThe athletes being tested will be escorted by 800 volunteer 'chaperones'.\n\nThe Paris organisers are responsible for \"collecting the samples\" and for the logistics, David Herbert, the organising committee's anti-doping manager, told AFP.\n\nIn total, some 50 anti-doping stations have been installed at the Olympic venues and in the village.\n\nThe organisers are also responsible for transporting the samples to the laboratory in Orsay, south of Paris. This will be done by vehicle on the specially reserved Olympic routes and by plane from Tahiti, where the surfing is taking place.\n\nAthletes who are not staying in the Olympic Village, such as the US basketball players, must give their location and are likely to see an anti-doping tester knocking on their hotel door.\n\nWhere are the samples tested?\n\nThe laboratory in Orsay will analyse the samples. In line with global anti-doping practices, genetic doping can now be detected.\n\nWADA will observe the testing process and give feedback to the ITA.\n\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport will open two temporary offices in Paris to resolve disputes, including those concerning doping.\n\nIn the run-up to the Olympics, WADA has come under scrutiny in the case of the Chinese swimmers after it accepted the explanation of Chinese authorities that the results were caused by food contamination.\n\nLatest on SportstarEuro 2024: More changes to Mbappe face mask as France star's problems persist APParis 2024: Testers aim to leave no doping cheat undetected at Olympics APWimbledon 2024, Women's results: Pegula romps to easy first-round win over Krueger ReutersDandu Laxmi Siri aims to conquer new heights under Sania Mirza's guidanceV.

And we are somewhat disappointed with how it has materialised and we look forward to hearing a little bit more.\"\n\nMinister of State for Sport Thomas Byrne said that the participation of athletes from Russia and Israel at this summer's Games was a matter for the sporting bodies concerned.\n\n\"The Government position is consistent in this, that it's a matter for the sports organisations themselves,\" said Byrne.\n\n\"We made strong statements about Russia and Belarus, but ultimately that was left to all of the sports organisations themselves to make their own decisions.\n\n\"And the same applies to Israel as well.\"\n\nTeam Ireland expects to send a team of nearly 130 athletes to Paris and there are contingency plans in place for their safety in the event of a terrorist attack in the French capital during the Games.\n\nSo far 60,000 tickets have been sold to Irish fans and there will be gardai on the ground in Paris in a liaising role to help with any difficulties that may arise.\n\nOFI President Sarah Keane will step down at the end of this year, but she believes she will leave an organisation that is in a much stronger position than the one that emerged from the ticketing scandal at Rio in 2016.\n\nAnd Keane is confident the correct structures are in now place for athletes representing Ireland on the Olympic stage.\n\n\"The athletes must be at the centre of our decision making together with those who support and work with those athletes to achieve their potential,\" said Keane.\n\n\"We are athlete-centred in a way we've never been before.\"\n\nChef de Mission Gavin Noble will travel to Paris in less than a week to put the final touches to the Irish base at the Olympic Village.\n\nHe's confident the team's logistics are now the match of any nation -- both at the Village and at the various final training camps for each sport.\n\n\"We need to get to the point where our norm is at a higher level than it was before,\" said Noble.\n\n\"So (we're) really confident that we're going to deliver that across physio, physiology, psychology.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri":

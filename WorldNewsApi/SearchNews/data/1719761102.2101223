Speaking to The Sun\u2019s Never Mind the Ballots, Mr Farage accused the Tories of betraying voters on illegal immigration. The Reform UK honorary president said: \u201cI got rid of Mrs May with the Brexit Party. I stood aside with Boris to help a massive majority. What are they going to do back for me?\u201d Asked if he would accept a peerage from the Conservative Party, he replied: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not asking for anything other than: I\u2019ve done them some huge favours over the years as a party, give me something back. We might have a conversation.\u201d Mr Farage said he believes Reform UK will \u201cwin a few\u201d seats at the General Election, but \u201cnot many because that\u2019s the system we\u2019re having to live with\u201d. During the interview, Mr Farage described Conservative former minister and prominent Brexiteer Sir Iain Duncan Smith as an \u201cally\u201d. But he added: \u201cThe betrayal, the lies, from the Conservative Party at every election since 2010 on illegal immigration, are just astonishing. And those people hate your party and they\u2019re not going to vote for them.\u201d Sir Iain replied: \u201cIf your party, Reform, end up standing in all the seats, they will end up delivering what they don\u2019t want.\u201d He added: \u201cAll you\u2019re intent on is destruction, you\u2019re not intent on achieving anything and all you\u2019ll get is a Labour Party that will come in and go in exactly the opposite direction to where Reform want.\u201d Prior to this, Mr Farage claimed the Conservatives were destroying themselves, adding: \u201cThey now stand for nothing, they serve no purpose at all, they\u2019re split completely down the middle. \u201cReally what Reform is about is a six-year plan to completely reshape the centre-right of politics.\u201d", "summary": "Speaking to The Sun\u2019s Never Mind the Ballots, Mr Farage accused the Tories of betraying voters on illegal immigration.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage-conservative-party-labour-party-the-sun-iain-duncan-smith-b1160868.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/05/29/15/17072f2941c235fc83426474265cdedbY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3MDc2MjMw-2.76354730.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:09:08", "author": "Rhiannon James", "authors": ["Rhiannon James"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.349}

AP\n\nThe Pentagon and White House declined to comment.\n\nTwo former senior U.S. officials with knowledge of the plan said that the proposal awaiting Trump's approval would elevate Cyber Command and lead to a 60-day study to determine whether Cyber Command would be separated from the National Security Agency, a spy agency responsible for electronic eavesdropping.\n\nThat would lead to Cyber Command becoming what the military called a \"unified command,\" equal to combat branches of the military such as the Central and Pacific Commands.\n\nIt would give Cyber Command leaders a larger voice in arguing for the use of both offensive and defensive cyber tools in future conflicts.\n\nCurrently, the NSA and Cyber Command organizations are based at Fort Meade, Maryland, about 30 miles north of Washington, and led by the same officer, Navy Admiral Michael Rogers.\n\nNSA's focus is gathering intelligence, officials said, often favoring the monitoring of an enemy's cyber activities. Cyber Command's mission is geared more to shutting down cyber attacks and, if ordered, counter attacking.\n\nThe NSA director has been a senior military officer since the agency's founding in 1952. Under the plan, future directors would be civilians, an arrangement meant to underscore that NSA is not subordinate to Cyber Command.\n\nEstablished in 2010, Cyber Command is now subordinate to the U.S. Strategic Command, which oversees military space operations, nuclear weapons and missile defense.\n\n#Cyber #Cyber command #Cyber weapons #Donald trump #Fort meade #Maryland #National security agency #Nsa #Trump #White house\n\nPublished Date: Aug 17, 2017 11:08 pm | Updated Date: Aug 17, 2017 11:08 pm\n\nTags : #Cyber #Cyber command #Cyber weapons #Donald trump #Fort meade #Maryland #National security agency #Nsa #Trump #White house", "id": "9747366", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Trump is planning to lift the status of Pentagon's Cyber Command for emphasis on cyber weapons", "image": "http://s2.firstpost.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Donald-Trump-Congress-380-AP1.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 2158, "freq": 2, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 2170}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Fort Meade"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "287232", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Meade,_Maryland", "label": {"eng": "Fort Meade"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Reuters"}, "id": "302588", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters"}, {"label": {"eng": "Espionage"}, "id": "302628", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage"}, {"label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}, "id": "302942", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"}, {"label": {"eng": "White House"}, "id": "303051", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House"}, {"label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}, "id": "303092", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}, "id": "303483", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon"}, {"label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}, "id": "304262", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States"}, {"label": {"eng": "Military"}, "id": "304332", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military"}, {"label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}, "id": "304952", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Security Agency"}, "id": "305997", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency"}, {"label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}, "id": "306002", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Civilian"}, "id": "307334", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}, "id": "310233", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Strategic Command"}, "id": "316736", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Strategic_Command"}, {"label": {"eng": "Missile defense"}, "id": "317587", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_defense"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cyberwarfare"}, "id": "320351", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare"}, {"label": {"eng": "Security agency"}, "id": "345583", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_agency"}, {"label": {"eng": "Director of the National Security Agency"}, "id": "353532", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_National_Security_Agency"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States Cyber Command"}, "id": "377677", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Cyber_Command"}, {"label": {"eng": "Unified Combatant Command"}, "id": "481550", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Combatant_Command"}, {"label": {"eng": "Michael Rogers (cyclist)"}, "id": "521154", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rogers_(cyclist)"}], "location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 164, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 916, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science and Technology", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Science_and_Technology"}], "time": "17:50:00"}

Gen. William Mayville, according to three defense officials. Currently, CYBERCOM and NSA are led by the same four-star commander, Adm.

The event will be at the stadium's Gallagher Club East, with parking in Lot C.\n\nTough question: What did Duval County superintendent candidates tell the School Board about closing schools?\n\nThe two educators -- Bernier resigned last month as superintendent of Lee County schools around Fort Myers; Smith is chief of staff for the Loudoun County, Va. school district in the Washington suburbs -- will also meet privately in one-on-one with Duval County School Board members during the two-day visit, then have public interviews with the full board on Tuesday May 14.\n\nIn the public interviews, board members will ask the same questions of both candidates in a formalized process where each member will explore a separate theme, such as fiscal transparency or personal leadership, working through a sheet of questions in the 90 minutes allotted for each finalist.\n\nFlorida School Boards Association CEO Andrea Messina, whose organization was contracted to work on the superintendent search, told board members she prepared about 225 questions to choose from within the seven themes.\n\nBig question: Mark Woods: Another superintendent search in Duval County. Who would want this job?\n\nAfter the board interviews, which start at 1 p.m. May 14 and end at 4:15 p.m., board members will have time to reflect before casting votes for the next superintendent on May 23.\n\nA contract is supposed to be worked out after that, with the superintendent starting the job around July 1.\n\nThe finalist choices mean the next superintendent will be a white man, whose life experiences will have been different from Superintendent Dana Kriznar. The veteran Duval administrator took over the top job last year after former Superintendent Diana Greene retired, later taking over a nonprofit focused on building literacy among Black and Latino children.\n\nTwo of the search process's semifinalists were Black and board Chair Darryl Willie and member Warren Jones both proposed including one of those -- Portland, Ore., Deputy Superintendent Cheryl Proctor -- in the finalist list, which didn't have to have a fixed number.\n\nJones noted that having just two finalists would leave the board no options if one of the finalists took a job in another district instead.\n\nBernier had been named last month as a finalist for a superintendent's job around Reno, Nev., but Messina said he told her he had withdrawn from that contest to focus on seeking the job in Jacksonville.", "source": {"uri": "eu.jacksonville.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Treasure Coast Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "florida_times_union@eu.jacksonville.com",

received multiple viewer emails expressing concerns about Dr. Daniel Smith due to his ties to the Loudoun County School District in Virginia.\n\nThe district was marred in controversy back in 2021 after a student accused of sexually assaulting a fellow student was transferred to a different school within the district.\n\nThat student was then accused of a second sexual assault at the new school.\n\nParents accused district leaders of mishandling the situation and attempting to cover it up.\n\nBut there's no indication Smith had anything to do with the scandal.\n\nSmith is never named in the grand jury report that investigated the district's handling of the alleged assaults.\n\nREAD: DCPS board members blast new police chief for 'credibility' issues over ties to Kent Stermon case\n\nIn fact, Smith was serving as principal of a school in an entirely different district during the scandal.\n\nSmith was hired as Chief of Staff for Louden County in April of 2022 after the district's prior Chief of Staff was ousted due to his handling of the alleged sexual assaults.\n\nSmith was then named Acting Superintendent in December of that year after the prior superintendent who had overseen the scandal was pushed out by the school board.\n\nAccording to reporting by the Loudoun Times, as Interim Superintendent, Smith pushed forward improvements to case management for problem students and also worked to enhance communication between the district and parents.\n\nGiven the recent allegations of sexual misconduct by teachers at Douglas Anderson and the district's handling of those allegations here in Duval, there are parallels that could be drawn to the issues Loudoun County faced back in 2021.\n\nIt was even the subject of a question posed by members of the Duval School Board to superintendent candidates.\n\nREAD: DCPS to select superintendent finalists at special meeting Tuesday afternoon\n\nIn his written response, Smith didn't directly address the specifics of the

Loudoun County Public Schools, I would facilitate community listening sessions to rebuild trust and gain insights into the issues at hand,\" Smith wrote.\n\nAction News Jax reached out to Smith directly regarding his time in Loudoun.\n\n\"I believe that it is important that I adhere to the interview process as established by the Duval County School Board and I would not want to be perceived

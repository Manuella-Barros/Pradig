{"id": 227485754, "title": "Being a patient is getting harder in a strained and complex US health care system", "text": "Tamika Davis couldn\u2019t nap on her couch during cancer treatment. She kept worrying one of her toddlers would wander over and pull out the needle delivering chemotherapy. Friends and family watched her kids when they could during her treatment last year for colon cancer. But Davis had gaps with no help because she couldn\u2019t afford child care and didn\u2019t know where to look for assistance. \u201cI did not have the strength nor the energy to try to navigate these things myself,\u201d the San Antonio, Texas, resident said. Patients are not getting enough help dealing with a healthcare system that is growing increasingly complex, according to researchers and other experts in care delivery. They say more frequent insurance complications, doctor and drug shortages, and a lack of communication all make life harder for people with serious or chronic illnesses. \u201cJust about anything you can think of, it\u2019s now harder to get it done, basically,\u201d said Elisabeth Schuler, founder and president of Patient Navigator, a business that helps people get through the system. More care providers and employers are offering help guiding people, a practice the federal Medicare program has started to cover. But that assistance has limits. Patients with serious or chronic illnesses face a web of challenges. They include: \u2014 Coordinating doctor appointments and tests, often while working or undergoing treatment. \u2014 Dealing with coverage denials or care delays due to insurer pre-approval requirements. \u2014 Figuring out how to fill a prescription if they can\u2019t get coverage or their medication lands on a growing list of drugs in shortage. \u2014 Acting as a go-between for doctors and specialists who don't talk to each other. \u2014 Paying medical bills and getting help with rent or utilities. That assistance has been harder to find since the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Beth Scott of the non-profit Patient Advocate Foundation. All of this can be compounded for patients who don't speak English or have no experience navigating the health care system, noted Gladys Arias, a policy principal with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network. Davis, the San Antonio cancer patient, said she was in the hospital when she asked for help finding community resources. She said a case manager set a book of available resources on her bedside table and did nothing else. Davis, a nursing professor, found the book confusing. The programs it detailed had different qualifications based on things like income or diagnosis. The 44-year-old wound up losing her car and leaving her home after care bills piled up. \u201cI feel like there was some type of help out there for me,\u201d she said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t know where to look.\u201d Ali DiGiacomo said she wishes that she learned in college how to deal with insurance companies. She often has to do that while coping with side effects from rheumatoid arthritis treatments. The 30-year-old personal trainer said she\u2019s spent years trying to get a diagnosis for bouts of intense chest pain, which doctors think may be tied to her condition. That requires imaging tests that insurers often decline to cover. \u201cDealing with them with brain fog and fatigue and being in pain is just like the cherry on top,\u201d DiGiacomo said. DiGiacomo said her formulary, or list of covered drugs, has changed three times. That can force her to hunt for a place that carries the newly covered drug, which puts her behind on her medication schedule. She figures she talks to her insurer at least four times a month. \u201cI have to hype myself up,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you talk to a million different people. I wish I just had like one person that helped me deal with all this.\u201d Care delays due to insurer pre-approval requirements have grown more common, many experts say. More plans also have made it challenging to get coverage outside their networks of doctors and hospitals. A typical appeal for a denial can easily involve 20 to 30 phone calls between the patient, the insurer and the doctor\u2019s office, said Scott, director of case management for Patient Advocate Foundation, which helps people with chronic or debilitating illnesses. She said some patients give up. \u201cSometimes you are sick, and you don\u2019t want to fight it anymore,\u201d she said. Case managers at hospitals are often overworked, which limits how much help they can provide, noted Schuler, who became a patient advocate about 20 years ago after her 2-year-old daughter went through cancer treatment. Overall, help for patients is \u201cvery patchy everywhere,\u201d according to Harvard Medical School researcher Michael Anne Kyle. \u201cI think we have a lot of Band-Aids that are necessary,\u201d she said. Many cancer centers offer patient navigators who can help coordinate appointments, get answers to coverage questions, find rides to the doctor and provide other support. Some insurers provide similar assistance. And more employers are offering navigation or advocacy help for people on their insurance plans, according to the benefits consultant Mercer. But these services still aren\u2019t widespread. Alzheimer\u2019s disease patients and their caregivers lack consistent access to such help, said Sam Fazio, a senior director with the non-profit Alzheimer\u2019s Association. \u201cPeople are having trouble finding their way,\u201d he said. Making the system better for patients requires big change, said Dr. Victor Montori, a Mayo Clinic researcher who studies care delivery. He said the system must focus more on minimally disruptive medicine, which makes care fit into patient lives. That means things like cutting unnecessary paperwork and surveys, making appointments more flexible and giving patients more time with doctors. He noted that the burden that falls on patients is not just the time and effort they spend navigating the system. It\u2019s also what they give up to do that. \u201cIf you waste people\u2019s time on silly things, you are being unkind to (their) main purpose, which is to live,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop thinking of the patient as a part time employee of the healthcare system that we don\u2019t get to pay.\u201d ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Science and Educational Media Group.

The Twins were hitless in their first nine at-bats with runners in scoring position, until Castro's smash down the right-field line and into the corner cleared the bases. Austin Martin, who walked to load them up, scored on a head-first lunge that got his hand on the plate just in time. Castro came home on Trevor Larnach's tying double.\n\nThe Rays hit three home runs for the second straight game, pushing their season total to 60. They entered the evening with the second-fewest in the major leagues.\n\nL\u00f3pez allowed seven hits and one walk with three strikeouts. His ERA ballooned to a season-worst 5.67, the highest it's been since May 10, 2019. Jhoan Duran (3-2) pitched the ninth for the win.\n\nAfter an All-Star selection in his Minnesota debut last year and two brilliant appearances in the playoffs, including the wild card series opening win that stopped the record 18-game postseason losing streak, L\u00f3pez has stumbled hard this season.\n\nThe two-out changeup that Arozarena hit was the first off L\u00f3pez to leave the ballpark this year, after throwing it 242 previous times. The most troubling sign for L\u00f3pez has been the ineffectiveness of his sweeper he dominated with in 2023. Lowe hit one of those for the tiebreaking shot in the fifth.\n\nArozarena's 10th homer tied Paredes for the team lead, but the 2021 American League Rookie of the Year is having his worst season in the major leagues with a .178 batting average and a .617 on-base-plus-slugging percentage entering the game.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRays RHP Taj Bradley (2-4, 4.23 ERA) pitches the middle game of the series on Wednesday night. RHP Joe Ryan (5-5, 3.24 ERA) takes the mound for the Twins.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"},

Santana hit a 1-1 curveball into right field to easily score Margot and give the Twins their eighth win in nine games.\n\n\"I'm the veteran, so I have a lot of situations, a lot of spots,\" said Santana, who delivered his 12th career game-ending hit and is 10 for 24 with 10 RBIs eight games into this homestand. \"Days where I don't play, my mentality is to finish.\"\n\nFairbanks sustained a bruised right thumb. His X-rays were negative.\n\n\"Tough situation to put Phil in right there,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said. \"When Pete comes in the game, you're banking he's going to be able to get through that inning one way or the other.\"\n\nMax Kepler homered and Ryan Jeffers hit a sacrifice fly for the Twins to tie the game in the fifth, after Brandon Lowe and Josh Lowe hit home runs in the top of the inning for the Rays on each side of a rain delay that lasted an hour and 23 minutes.\n\nRandy Arozarena's three-run homer in the first off struggling Twins starter Pablo L\u00f3pez put the Rays in front. After Willi Castro hit a three-run double with two outs in a four-run fourth inning to ignite the Twins, L\u00f3pez promptly let the Rays back in front on Brandon Lowe's leadoff line drive -- through the drops that had just begun to fall -- into the seats above right-center field.\n\nWith Isaac Paredes facing a 2-2 count and the rain pouring down, home plate umpire Vic Carapazza waved the players off the field as fans scrambled to find the overhangs.\n\nThe rain started slowly again in the bottom of the eighth, but lightly enough to play through as the Twins overcame a four-run deficit for the second time in four games.\n\nJhoan Duran (3-2) pitched the ninth for the win. After Josh Lowe took Jay Jackson deep, Twins relievers retired the last 14 batters.\n\n\"When the games are tight, just keep pitching well and make the plays, and then just find a way to score a run,\" manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"Our lineup up and down is doing nice work.\"\n\nL\u00f3pez allowed seven hits and one walk with three strikeouts. His ERA ballooned to a season-worst 5.67, the highest it's been since May 10, 2019.\n\nAfter an All-Star selection in his Minnesota debut last year and two brilliant appearances in the playoffs, including the wild-card series opening win that stopped the record 18-game postseason losing streak, L\u00f3pez has stumbled hard this season.\n\nThe two-out changeup that Arozarena hit was the first off L\u00f3pez to leave the ballpark this year, after throwing it 242 previous times. The most troubling sign for L\u00f3pez has been the ineffectiveness of his sweeper he dominated with in 2023. Brandon Lowe hit one of those for the tiebreaking shot in the fifth, adding to the major league -high total of home runs allowed by L\u00f3pez (16).\n\nRays starter Aaron Civale's winless streak stretched to 12 starts. The Twins were hitless in their first nine at-bats with runners in scoring position, until Castro's smash down the right-field line and into the corner cleared the bases.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRays RHP Taj Bradley (2-4, 4.23 ERA) pitches the middle game of the series on Wednesday night. RHP Joe Ryan (5-5, 3.24 ERA) takes the mound for the Twins.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors":

This is his first season with the Twins, who will go for seven wins in a row when they play the Tampa Bay Rays on Wednesday evening in Minneapolis in the second contest of a three-game series.\n\n\"The energy is great,\" Santana said. \"We play hard every day. I can see everybody preparing every day. Right now, we're playing for wins. We know it's a long season, the thing is up and down, but right now we're in a great spot.\"\n\nSantana is the Twins' latest hero after providing a two-out, walk-off RBI single in the bottom of the ninth inning Tuesday to lift the Twins to a 7-6 win over the Rays in the series opener. Minnesota erased a 4-0 deficit to rally for the victory.\n\nThe Rays will try to bounce back as they look to avoid their second series loss in a row.\n\nTampa Bay could be without right-hander Pete Fairbanks out of the bullpen. Fairbanks left Tuesday's game with two outs in the ninth inning after he was hit in the hand by a comebacker off the bat of the Twins' Carlos Correa that went for a hit.\n\nThe Rays said X-rays were negative on Fairbanks, who sustained a bruised right thumb.\n\n\"I think Pete will be OK,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said.\n\nTwins right-hander Joe Ryan (5-5, 3.24 ERA) is set to make his 15th start of the season. He has recorded back-to-back quality starts against the Pittsburgh Pirates and Oakland Athletics in his most recent efforts, allowing two runs in seven innings each time.\n\nThis will be Ryan's second career start against the Rays. He earned a no-decision in his first matchup as he allowed two runs on five hits in 4 2/3 innings for a 3.86 ERA in a Twins win last September.\n\nThe Rays will counter with right-hander Taj Bradley (2-4, 4.23), who is slated to make his eighth start of 2024. The 23-year-old has 50 strikeouts in 38 1/3 innings.\n\nBradley earned a win in his most recent outing. He held the Cubs to two unearned runs on three hits in seven innings, and he walked two while striking out a season-high 11.\n\nLast season, Bradley made one start against the Twins. He gave up four runs on four hits in 4 2/3 innings for a 7.71 ERA but escaped with a no-decision in his team's 5-4 win.\n\nRandy Arozarena will look to maintain his success against the Twins. The Rays outfielder hit a three-run homer on Tuesday night, and he is hitting .353 (24-for-68) with five homers and 15 RBIs in 19 career games against Minnesota.\n\nRays infielder Jose Caballero should be available once again after returning to the lineup for the series opener. Caballero had not played since Friday because of an illness as well as tightness in his left calf.\n\nMinnesota is 23-14 at home.

(AP Photo/Abbie Parr)\n\nAfter Willi Castro hit a three-run double with two outs in a four-run fourth inning to ignite the Twins, L\u00f3pez promptly let the Rays back in front on Brandon Lowe\u00b4s leadoff line drive - through the drops that had just begun to fall - into the seats above right-center field.\n\nWith Isaac Paredes facing a 2-2 count and the rain pouring down, home plate umpire Vic Carapazza waved the players off the field as fans scrambled to find the overhangs.\n\nThe rain started slowly again in the bottom of the eighth.\n\nJosh Lowe had an RBI single in the third inning, after Paredes reached on a high pop-up that twisted in the pre-storm wind down the left-field line beyond Twins shortstop Correa and fell in the grass after veering late.\n\nRays starter Aaron Civale\u00b4s winless streak stretched to 12 straight starts. The Twins were hitless in their first nine at-bats with runners in scoring position, until Castro\u00b4s smash down the right-field line and into the corner cleared the bases. Austin Martin, who walked to load them up, scored on a head-first lunge that got his hand on the plate just in time. Castro came home on Trevor Larnach\u00b4s tying double.\n\nThe Rays hit three home runs for the second straight game, pushing their season total to 60. They entered the evening with the second-fewest in the major leagues.\n\nL\u00f3pez allowed seven hits and one walk with three strikeouts. His ERA ballooned to a season-worst 5.67, the highest it\u00b4s been since May 10, 2019.\n\nAfter an All-Star selection in his Minnesota debut last year and two brilliant appearances in the playoffs, including the wild card series opening win that stopped the record 18-game postseason losing streak, L\u00f3pez has stumbled hard this season.\n\nThe two-out changeup that Arozarena hit was the first off L\u00f3pez to leave the ballpark this year, after throwing it 242 previous times. The most troubling sign for L\u00f3pez has been the ineffectiveness of his sweeper he dominated with in 2023. Lowe hit one of those for the tiebreaking shot in the fifth.\n\nArozarena\u00b4s 10th homer tied Paredes for the team lead, but the 2021 American League Rookie of the Year is having his worst season in the major leagues with a .178 batting average and a .617 on-base-plus-slugging percentage entering the game.\n\nRays RHP Taj Bradley (2-4, 4.23 ERA) pitches the middle game of the series on Wednesday night.

Our MLB odds series has our Rays-Twins prediction, odds, and pick for Wednesday.\n\nThe Rays make the trip to Minnesota to face the Twins! The Rays have struggled with consistency this season, while the Twins have been one of the better teams in the MLB. The Twins also come into this game red-hot, while the Rays have struggled. Our MLB odds series has our Rays-Twins prediction, odds, and pick for Wednesday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched seven innings and gave up two runs on three hits with two walks and 11 strikeouts in a Rays win.\n\nLast Start: Pitched seven innings and gave up two runs on three hits with one walk and five strikeouts in a Twins win.\n\nThe Rays have been inconsistent out of the gate, and currently sit with a 34-38 record. The Rays are below average on offense and then are in the bottom half of the MLB in pitching. This play on both sides of the ball is why they have struggled to find consistency as a team. Isaac Paredes, Amed Rosario, Yandy Diaz, Harold Ramirez, Jose Caballero, and Randy Arozarena have been solid for the Rays offense. On the mound, Zach Eflin and Zack Littell have been solid for a unit that has not been great this season.\n\nThe Rays are starting Taj Bradley at pitcher where he has a 2-4 record, a 4.23 ERA, and a 1.10 WHIP. He has allowed 20 runs on 30 hits with 12 walks and 50 strikeouts through 38.1 innings. The Rays are also 3-4 in the seven games that he has started, so far this season. Taj Bradley has been decent on the mound in a more limited capacity, and the Twins present a decent challenge behind the plate.\n\nThe offense for the Rays has struggled this season behind the plate. They are 23rd in team-batting average at .232 after finishing with a .260 last season. Isaac Paredes and Yandy Diaz lead the way in most batting categories. Paredes leads in batting average at .281, in home runs at 10, in RBI at 38, and in OBP at .360. Diaz then leads the way in total hits at 73. This is a difficult matchup against Joe Ryan because he has been great this season for the Twins as the best pitcher their staff has to offer so far. The Rays have struggled, so on paper this favors Ryan.\n\nWhy The Twins Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Twins are 40-32 and have won seven out of their last eight games. The Twins are around the middle of the pack and are struggling in pitching. Alex Kirilloff, Edouard Julien, Byron Buxton, Willi Castro, Carlos Santana, and Ryan Jeffers are some notable names on this Minnesota offense despite the struggles. On the mound, Joe Ryan and Simeon Woods Richardson are the names to watch despite the struggles they have dealt with there as a staff.\n\nThe Twins are starting Joe Ryan on the mound where he has a 5-5 record, a 3.24 ERA, and a 0.94 WHIP. He has allowed 34 runs on 67 hits with 14 walks and 90 strikeouts through 86 innings. The Twins are 8-6 in the 14 games that he's started so far this season. Ryan has been the best pitcher in a pitching staff that has needed more consistency overall. He gets a favorable matchup against a Rays offense that has struggled this season.\n\nThe offense for the Twins has been around the middle of the pack this season. They have jumped all over the place in the rankings but are 15th in the MLB in team batting average at .243 after finishing with the same last season. Willi Castro, Ryan Jeffers, Carlos Santana, and Carlos Correa lead the way for the Twins in most of their batting categories. Correa leads in batting average at .308 and in OBP at .370. Then, Jeffers leads in home runs at 12, Santana leads in RBI at 36, and Castro leads in total hits at 64. This offense gets an interesting matchup against Taj Bradley for the Rays because he has been more limited this season, but has been solid. The Twins have jumped all over the place in offense and have talent and depth.\n\nFinal Rays-Twins Prediction & Pick\n\nThis game is going to end up being a pitching duel. Ryan has been great for Minnesota and Bradley has been great in a more limited role in Tampa Bay. Neither team has been great on offense, but the Twins are slightly better behind the plate. The Rays should cover this spread thanks to Bradley. Twins might still win thanks to the home-field advantage.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_faigus@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jake Faigus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Ryan_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Ryan (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amed_Rosario", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amed Rosario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Jeffers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Jeffers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willi_Castro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willi Castro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Arozarena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Arozarena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Littell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zack Littell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Eflin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Eflin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Kirilloff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Kirilloff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ervin_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ervin Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Buxton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byron Buxton"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Crystallography", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Crystallography", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Rays-vs.-Twins-prediction-odds-pick-how-to-watch-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663724", "eventUri": "eng-9663724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Phil Maton worked a 1-2-3 inning in the 10th for his second save, with closer Pete Fairbanks unavailable after the thumb on his throwing hand was bruised by a comebacker the night before.\n\nJorge Alcala (1-2) hit Randy Arozarena with a pitch to start the inning. He threw a sinker in the dirt so wildly it ricocheted off the backstop and right to catcher Christian V\u00e1zquez for a relatively easy throw-out of automatic runner Jose Siri at third.\n\nLewis, who snagged Siri\u00b4s grounder with the bases loaded in the seventh and beat Amed Rosario to the bag for the inning-ending force out, fielded a sharp chopper by Jonny DeLuca to his left and sent his deep throw sailing past first baseman Carlos Santana that let Arozarena score the go-ahead run.\n\nLewis went 3 for 4 with a walk and a tiebreaking home run in the fifth inning that broke part of a videoboard at Target Field.\n\nMinnesota Twins starting pitcher Joe Ryan delivers during the third inning of a baseball game against the Tampa Bay Rays, Wednesday, June 19, 2024, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)\n\nIsaac Paredes hit his team-leading 11th home run in the third off Twins starter Joe Ryan, who sailed through six innings with a 2-1 lead before a bumpy performance by the bullpen. Ryan delivered another bid to make his first All-Star team, allowing one run on six hits and one walk.\n\nRyan, who was selected in the seventh round by the Rays in the same 2018 draft that fetched Bradley in the fifth round, was traded to the Twins in 2021 for 55 games of veteran slugger Nelson Cruz. The Rays lost in the division series of the playoffs about 2\u00bd months later.\n\nRays starter Taj Bradley gave up two runs on seven hits and two walks in six innings.\n\nLewis hit his eighth homer in 14 games since returning from a severely strained quadriceps muscle suffered in the season opener. With an exit velocity measured at 108.7 mph, this one ricocheted off the ribbon board that fronts the second deck above left field - and appeared to knock out a long section of LED lights that used to depict the rotating advertisements. The red Budweiser logos that were up at the time wound up with a blank black splotch, as did the rest that followed.\n\nIn 90 career major league games including the playoffs, Lewis has hit 29 homers with 74 RBIs.\n\nCole Sands relieved Ryan for the seventh and surrendered a one-out bloop single to Ben Rortvedt, before pinch-runner Jose Caballero stole second base and took third when shortstop Carlos Correa let the throw bounce out of his glove and into center field.\n\nYandy Diaz tied the game with the softest of singles, a swinging bunt of sorts that dribbled down the third-base line where Lewis had no play.\n\nFairbanks played catch without any problems before the game, after his minor injury on Tuesday. He said he feels normal and expects to be available for action by Thursday.\n\nThe Rays will send RHP Zack Littell (2-5, 4.24 ERA) to the mound for the series finale on Thursday afternoon, opposite Twins rookie RHP Simeon Woods Richardson (2-1, 3.29 ERA). Littell made his major league debut with the Twins in 2018, after being acquired from the Yankees in a trade the year before.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB\n\nTampa Bay Rays starting pitcher Taj Bradley delivers during the second inning of a baseball game against the Minnesota Twins, Wednesday, June 19, 2024, in Minneapolis.

Phil Maton worked a 1-2-3 inning in the 10th for his second save, with closer Pete Fairbanks unavailable.\n\nJorge Alcala (1-2) hit Arozarena with a pitch to start the inning. He threw a sinker in the dirt so wildly it ricocheted off the backstop and right to catcher Christian V\u00e1zquez for a relatively easy throw-out of automatic runner Jose Siri at third.\n\nLewis, who had an otherwise-stellar night in the field and at the plate, fielded a sharp chopper by Jonny DeLuca to his left and sent his deep throw sailing past first baseman Carlos Santana that allowed Arozarena to race home.\n\n\"Out of the hand, it just cut. That's all I've got for you,\" Lewis said. \"I wouldn't do anything different about that play. I set my feet and made the best throw I could.\"\n\nLewis went 3 for 4 with a walk and a tiebreaking home run in the fifth inning that broke part of a videoboard at Target Field.\n\nIsaac Paredes hit his team-leading 11th home run in the third off Twins starter Joe Ryan, who sailed through six innings with a 2-1 lead before a bumpy performance by the bullpen. Ryan delivered another bid to make his first All-Star team, allowing one run on six hits and one walk.\n\nRyan, who was selected in the seventh round by the Rays in the same 2018 draft that fetched Bradley in the fifth round, was traded to the Twins in 2021 for 55 games of veteran slugger Nelson Cruz. The Rays lost in the division series of the playoffs about 2 1/2 months later.\n\nRays starter Taj Bradley gave up two runs and seven hits with two walks in six innings.\n\nLewis hit his eighth homer in 14 games this season. He recently returned from a severely strained quadriceps muscle suffered in the season opener. With an exit velocity measured at 108.7 mph, this one ricocheted off the ribbon board that fronts the second deck above left field -- and appeared to knock out a long section of LED lights that used to depict the rotating advertisements. The red Budweiser logos that were up at the time wound up with a blank black splotch, as did the rest that followed.\n\nIn 90 career major league games including the playoffs, Lewis has hit 29 homers with 74 RBIs.\n\n\"I keep saying it: 'More to come,'\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.\n\nYandy Diaz tied the game in the seventh with the softest of singles, a swinging bunt of sorts that dribbled down the third-base line where Lewis had no play. The Rays pieced that run together with a bloop single, a stolen base and an error on shortstop Carlos Correa when the throw bounced out of his glove and into center field to put Jose Caballero at third.\n\n\"It was an odd game,\" Cash said. \"Glad that we pulled it out. Lot of good things.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nFairbanks played catch without any problems before the game, after the thumb on his throwing hand was bruised by a comebacker on Tuesday. He said he expects to be available by Thursday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Rays will send RHP Zack Littell (2-5, 4.24 ERA) to the mound for the series finale on Thursday afternoon, opposite Twins rookie RHP Simeon Woods Richardson (2-1, 3.29 ERA).", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@orlandosentinel.com",

He recorded hits in his first three at-bats on Wednesday -- two singles and a go-ahead solo homer that broke a videoboard on the second deck -- finishing his night 3 for 4 with a walk and an RBI. The Twins, however, did lose 3-2 to the Rays.\n\n\"I pride myself, I told (Twins hitting coach David Popkins on Wednesday), 'Hey, I don't do that slump thing,'\" Lewis said. \"That's not a real thing for me. I understand that that's a thing, baseball, you're going to go into a slump or whatever, but for me, I don't have that mindset. It's a new day.\"\n\nThe only blemish for Lewis was that his 10th-inning throwing error allowed the go-ahead run to score in the Twins' loss to the Rays. But just like Lewis said, Thursday's finale will be a new day.\n\nAnd there are also now hard feelings about the damaged videoboard. It was back in working order ahead of Thursday's finale with a bandaid and a message reading, \"Don't worry, Royce. We fixed it!\"\n\nCarlos Correa and Willi Castro are both out of the lineup for Thursday's series finale against the Rays. Both of the everyday players were due for a rest day, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said.\n\n\"There was going to be a day it was coming, so I just figured if we're going to give one guy the day, maybe we just give them both the day and we get some of these other guys who are ready to play out there,\" Baldelli said. \"Both will be available to come in if we need them to come in.\"\n\nKyle Farmer will step in at shortstop and Austin Martin will get his first day at second base since being called back up from the Triple-A St. Paul Saints.

Jorge Alcala's first pitch to Richie Palacios was well inside and got past catcher Christian Vazquez. But the ball caromed off the back wall right to Vazquez, who threw out Siri as he tried to get to third.\n\nPhil Maton, who gave up a walk-off hit Tuesday, got the final three outs on Wednesday. The Rays improved to 35-39 with the win.\n\nThe Rays got a solid start from Taj Bradley, who held the Twins to two runs over six innings while throwing a career-high 104 pitches.\n\nThe Rays wasted their best chance to go ahead in the eighth despite three walks by reliever Josh Staumont, as the Twins flashed some leather.\n\nArozarena and Palacios started the inning with walks, but DeLuca couldn't get down a bunt before striking out. Jose Cabellero grounded a ball to the left side that shortstop Carlos Correa snared and thew to third to force Arozarena. After Taylor Walls walked to load the bases, Yandy Diaz lashed a 107.9-mph liner to left that Austin Martin leaped to snare.\n\nThat, after scoring one run in the seventh to tie the score 2-2, but failing to add on.\n\nAfter Ben Rortvedt singled with one out, pinch-runner Caballero, who leads the American League in steals, swiped second and went to third when Correa couldn't handle the throw.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThat paid off, after Walls walked, as Diaz hit a slow roller down the third base line that scored Caballero to make it 2-2.\n\nThat left the Rays with two on and one out, but Twins lefty Steven Okert didn't let them home, getting pinch-hitter Amed Rosario to ground into a fielder's choice, walking Isaac Paredes and getting pinch-hitter Siri to also ground into an out.\n\nAs in the first four games of the road trip, the Rays scored first again Wednesday. Having left runners in scoring position in the first two innings, Paredes took matters into his own hands in the third, swatting a two-out homer. And like the first 63 of his career, it went toward left field.\n\nThe lead didn't last long. Bradley allowed a leadoff single to No. 9 hitter Martin, then another to Willi Castro that put runners on the corners. Trevor Larnach hit a ground ball to first that Diaz turned into a nifty double play, but Martin scored to make it 1-1.\n\nThe Twins took the lead in the fifth when Bradley made one his few mistakes. With two outs and no one on, he left a 2-2 cutter over the plate, and Lewis knocked it 410 feet over the left-field wall.\n\nBradley, the 23-year-old, second-year starter, worked six strong innings, allowing two runs on seven hits in his third straight start increasing his career-high number of pitches.\n\nThe Rays knew they were giving up a good starting pitching prospect when they made the unusual-for-them July 2021 trade with the Twins to add veteran slugger Nelson Cruz.\n\nBut Cruz struggled with the Rays, hitting just .226 with a .725 OPS. And Joe Ryan turned into the strong starter the Rays expected.\n\nHe reminded them Wednesday, allowing one run, six hits and a walk over six innings, striking out five, logging 19 swings-and-misses.\n\n\u00a92024 Tampa Bay Times.

Paredes opened the scoring in the contest with a 359-foot (95.5 mph EV) solo shot off of Joe Ryan that was pulled down the left field line. The 25-year-old slugger also singled and walked in the contest, finishing the night 2-for-3.

They worked out of some trouble in the bottom of the inning. They added three insurance runs in the ninth.\n\nAnd they nearly blew it before pulling out a 7-6 win in 10 innings.\n\nAfter allowing the Twins to tie the game with four runs in the ninth, the Rays took the lead back in the 10th. Jonny DeLuca delivered the go-ahead run with a one-out single, scoring Taylor Walls, the runner placed at second to start the inning. Pete Fairbanks, who gave up the game-tying, three-run homer in the ninth, came back out to finish the game.\n\nHe got a huge assist from Jose Siri, who made a spectacular throw to third to nail Royce Lewis trying to move up from second to third on a fly out.\n\nThe Rays seemed positioned to win it in the ninth, when manager Kevin Cash opted for Chris Devenski to pitch with a four-run lead and he quickly made a mess. Devesnki allowed a homer to Carlos Santana, a double and a walk, and was quickly replaced by Fairbanks, who had been warming up originally.\n\nFairbanks got a ground ball out and a strikeout, and quickly got ahead of Jose Miranda. But he left a 1-2 slider over the plate, and Miranda delivered a three-run homer to tie the game at 6-6.\n\nThe Rays rallied in the eighth to take the lead, with Amed Rosario delivering the go-ahead run with a pinch-hit double, scoring Richie Palacios, who stole second and was pinch-running for Isaac Paredes after his one-out single.\n\nAfter the Rays took a 3-2 lead in the eighth, they did some work to maintain and extend it.\n\nLefty reliever Garrett Cleavinger allowed two of the three batters he faced in the bottom of the eighth to reach base, but Kevin Kelly came on to clean up the mess. Siri and Yandy Diaz launched homers in the top of the ninth to extend the lead.\n\nThe win was the Rays' second straight, giving them a series victory over the contending Twins, and third in the last four games, evening their record at 3-3 on the nine-game road trip that concludes with a weekend series in Pittsburgh.\n\nOverall, the Rays improved to 36-39 and moved ahead of idle Toronto and out of last place in the American League East, where they had been since June 9.\n\nThe Rays scored first, as they have in each of the first six games on the trip, on back-to-back doubles in the second by Josh Lowe and a warming Randy Arozarena off Twins starter Simeon Woods Richardson.\n\nThe Twins answered right back, as Santana singled, then scored on a two-out double by Kyle Farmer.\n\nThe Rays went back ahead in the top of the third when Alex Jackson -- of the sub-.100 batting average -- led off with a double, went to third on Diaz's fly out to center and scored on Brandon Lowe's sacrifice fly to right.\n\nThen the Twins quickly got even again, with a two-out homer by Lewis, his ninth in 15 games this season, having returned to action June 4 after being hurt on opening day.\n\nZack Littell was confident his rough last start in Atlanta Friday -- allowing seven runs (six earned) and lasting only two innings -- was just a bad day, with no cause for concern or corrections.\n\nAnd he proved that to be true with a solid bounce-back performance on Thursday, working five innings, allowing two runs, five hits and two walks while striking out five, though throwing 95 pitches.\n\n* * *\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

The Twins won the series opener 7-6 on Tuesday before the Rays bounced back for a 3-2 victory in 10 innings on Wednesday.\n\nA throwing error by Twins third baseman Royce Lewis opened the door for the Rays to score what proved to be the winning run.\n\nTwins manager Rocco Baldelli said it was not fair to pin the loss on Lewis. He cited a lack of timely hitting as a reason the game could be decided by a defensive miscue.\n\nBaldelli also said that he was fully focused on Thursday's series finale instead of letting his thoughts linger on what could have gone differently on Wednesday.\n\n\"In this game, sometimes you make an error,\" Baldelli said. \"We end up talking about it because it was a 2-2 game, so it ended up factoring in. But we'll get back to work (Thursday) and move on from it.\"\n\nBaldelli hopes to see a better performance from the Twins at the plate.\n\n\"We were right there in the game,\" he said. \"We didn't put it together offensively the way we have a few other times this week. We had some good swings. We kind of scattered them around ... but we just didn't do enough offensively.\"\n\nThe Rays also are hoping for more offense before they leave Minnesota.\n\n\"We've got to find ways to score some more runs,\" Cash said. \"There's no doubt. Leaving (12) guys on -- we're a better offense than that. I'm happy that we won the game (on Wednesday), but the guys know we've got to score.\"\n\nRays right-hander Zack Littell (2-5, 4.24 ERA) will get the start in the series finale as he tries to bounce back from his toughest outing of the season. He gave up seven runs (six earned) on eight hits in two innings against the Atlanta Braves on Friday.\n\nLittell is 0-1 with a 3.00 ERA in three career games (one start) against the Twins. In those contests, he struck out nine and issued no walks in nine innings.\n\nThe Twins will counter with Simeon Woods Richardson (2-1, 3.29).

Phil Maton worked a 1-2-3 inning in the 10th for his second save, with closer Pete Fairbanks unavailable after the thumb on his throwing hand was bruised by a comebacker the night before.\n\nJorge Alcala (1-2) hit Randy Arozarena with a pitch to start the inning. He threw a sinker in the dirt so wildly it ricocheted off the backstop and right to catcher Christian V\u00e1zquez for a relatively easy throw-out of automatic runner Jose Siri at third.\n\nLewis, who snagged Siri's grounder with the bases loaded in the seventh and beat Amed Rosario to the bag for the inning-ending force out, fielded a sharp chopper by Jonny DeLuca to his left and sent his deep throw sailing past first baseman Carlos Santana that let Arozarena score the go-ahead run.\n\nLewis went 3 for 4 with a walk and a tiebreaking home run in the fifth inning that broke part of a videoboard at Target Field.\n\nIsaac Paredes hit his team-leading 11th home run in the third off Twins starter Joe Ryan, who sailed through six innings with a 2-1 lead before a bumpy performance by the bullpen. Ryan delivered another bid to make his first All-Star team, allowing one run on six hits and one walk.\n\nRyan, who was selected in the seventh round by the Rays in the same 2018 draft that fetched Bradley in the fifth round, was traded to the Twins in 2021 for 55 games of veteran slugger Nelson Cruz. The Rays lost in the division series of the playoffs about 2\u00bd months later.\n\nRays starter Taj Bradley gave up two runs on seven hits and two walks in six innings.\n\nLewis hit his eighth homer in 14 games since returning from a severely strained quadriceps muscle suffered in the season opener. With an exit velocity measured at 108.7 mph, this one ricocheted off the ribbon board that fronts the second deck above left field -- and appeared to knock out a long section of LED lights that used to depict the rotating advertisements. The red Budweiser logos that were up at the time wound up with a blank black splotch, as did the rest that followed.\n\nIn 90 career major league games including the playoffs, Lewis has hit 29 homers with 74 RBIs.\n\nCole Sands relieved Ryan for the seventh and surrendered a one-out bloop single to Ben Rortvedt, before pinch-runner Jose Caballero stole second base and took third when shortstop Carlos Correa let the throw bounce out of his glove and into center field.\n\nYandy Diaz tied the game with the softest of singles, a swinging bunt of sorts that dribbled down the third-base line where Lewis had no play.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nFairbanks played catch without any problems before the game, after his minor injury on Tuesday. He said he feels normal and expects to be available for action by Thursday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Rays will send RHP Zack Littell (2-5, 4.24 ERA) to the mound for the series finale on Thursday afternoon, opposite Twins rookie RHP Simeon Woods Richardson (2-1, 3.29 ERA). Littell made his major league debut with the Twins in 2018, after being acquired from the Yankees in a trade the year before.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB", "source": {"uri":

Max Kepler led off the inning with a homer to cut the deficit to 6-5, and Ryan Jeffers evened the score at 6-6 with a sacrifice fly to center to drive in Correa.\n\nThe game included an hour-plus rain delay in the fifth inning.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "bnd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belleville News-Democrat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@bnd.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk-off_home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walk-off home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Margot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Margot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Fairbanks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Fairbanks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Arozarena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Arozarena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Jeffers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Jeffers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Larnach", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Larnach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kepler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Kepler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_rule_double", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ground rule double"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/qd9d39/picture289383204/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/545ec194-3e25-4274-b559-9e2e7fcc43ab", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663724", "eventUri": "eng-9663724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Carlos Correa flied out to center field to lead off the bottom of the inning, and Jose Siri threw out automatic runner Royce Lewis at third for a double play. While Ryan Jeffers singled the next at-bat, Carlos Santana then flied out to center to end the game.\n\nJosh Lowe hit an RBI double in the eighth inning to plate the go-ahead run for the Rays, who then found a trio of runs off a pair of homers in the ninth inning to appear well on their way to a victory.\n\nTrailing 3-2 following Lowe's eighth-inning double, Twins reliever Jay Jackson surrendered a 404-foot solo homer to Jose Siri, then a two-run, 439-foot blast to Yandy Diaz that put the Twins down 6-2.\n\nBut Rays reliever Chris Devenski gave up a leadoff 386-foot solo homer to Santana in the bottom of the inning, then a double to Byron Buxton before issuing a walk to Kyle Farmer, which ended his day. Pete Fairbanks came on in relief, but he gave up a three-run shot to Miranda.\n\nThe Twins (41-34) tied it up at 2-2 during the bottom of the third inning when Lewis hit a 373-foot solo homer to left field, his second homer in as many days and ninth in 15 games this season.\n\nThe Rays (36-39) took a 2-1 lead in the top of the inning when Brandon Lowe hit a sacrifice fly to right field that scored Alex Jackson, who led off the frame with a double to left field.\n\nBoth teams plated runs in the second inning that made it a 1-1 game. Josh Lowe and Randy Arozarena hit back-to-back doubles, Arozarena's scoring Lowe to make it a 1-0 game in the top of the inning. Kyle Farmer knotted it up for the Twins with an RBI double in the bottom that scored Santana, who singled a couple at-bats earlier. It remained a 2-2 game until Lowe's eighth-inning double.\n\nThe late runs spoiled a solid start from Simeon Woods Richardson, who gave up just the two runs off four hits while fanning six across his six innings of work. Rays starter Zack Littell, meanwhile, also gave up just two runs off five hits while fanning five across five innings.\n\nThe Twins will now begin a road trip, which will start on Friday night at the Oakland Athletics.

Jorge Alcala's first pitch to Richie Palacios was well inside and got past catcher Christian Vazquez. But the ball caromed off the back wall right to Vazquez, who threw out Siri as he tried to get to third.\n\nPhil Maton, who gave up a walkoff hit Tuesday, got the final three outs on Wednesday. The Rays improved to 35-39 with the win.\n\nThe Rays got a solid start from Taj Bradley, who held the Twins to two runs over six innings while throwing a career-high 104 pitches.\n\nThe Rays wasted their best chance to go ahead in the eighth despite three walks by reliever Josh Staumont, as the Twins flashed some leather.\n\nArozarena and Palacios started the inning with walks, but DeLuca couldn't get down a bunt before striking out. Jose Cabellero grounded a ball to the left side that shortstop Carlos Correa snared and thew to third to force Arozarena. After Taylor Walls walked to load the bases, Yandy Diaz lashed a 107.9 mph liner to left that Austin Martin leaped to snare.\n\nThat, after scoring one run in the seventh to tie the score 2-2, but failing to add on.\n\nAfter Ben Rortvedt singled with one out, pinch-runner Caballero, who leads the American League in steals, swiped second and went to third when Correa couldn't handle the throw.\n\nThat paid off, after Walls walked, as Diaz hit a slow roller down the third base line that scored Caballero to make it 2-2.\n\nThat left the Rays with two on and one out, but Twins lefty Steven Okert didn't let them home, getting pinch-hitter Amed Rosario to ground into a fielder's choice, walking Isaac Paredes and getting pinch-hitter Siri to also ground into an out.\n\nAs in the first four games of the road trip, the Rays scored first again Wednesday. Having left runners in scoring position in the first two innings, Paredes took matters into his own hands in the third, swatting a two-out homer. And like the first 63 of his career, it went toward leftfield.\n\nThe lead didn't last long. Bradley allowed a leadoff single to No. 9 hitter Martin, then another to Willi Castro that put runners on the corners. Trevor Larnach hit a ground ball to first that Diaz turned into a nifty double play, but Martin scored to make it 1-1.\n\nThe Twins took the lead in the fifth when Bradley made one his few mistakes. With two outs and no one on, he left a 2-2 cutter over the plate, and Lewis knocked it 410 feet over the leftfield wall.\n\nBradley, the 23-year-old, second-year starter, worked six strong innings, allowing two runs on seven hits in his third straight start increasing his career-high number of pitches.\n\nThe Rays knew they were giving up a good starting pitching prospect when they made the unusual-for-them July 2021 trade with the Twins to add veteran slugger Nelson Cruz.\n\nBut Cruz struggled with the Rays, hitting just .226 with a .725 OPS. And Joe Ryan turned into the strong starter the Rays expected.\n\nHe reminded them Wednesday, allowing one run, six hits and a walk over six innings, striking out five, logging 19 swings-and-misses.\n\n* * *\n\nSign up for the Sports Today newsletter to get daily updates on the Bucs, Rays, Lightning and college football across Florida.\n\nNever miss out on the latest with your favorite Tampa Bay sports teams.

But on Wednesday, runs were at a premium, and a couple of defensive mistakes ended up leading to the end of the Twins' winning streak.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Rays used a Royce Lewis throwing error in the 10th inning on Wednesday to edge the Twins, 3-2, at Target Field.\n\nOn what should have been the final out of a scoreless inning for reliever Jorge Alcala, Lewis's throw got past first baseman Carlos Santana, allowing Randy Arozarena to score from second base. The Twins then went down quietly in the bottom of the 10th.\n\nAnother costly error helped the Rays tie the game in the seventh, taking advantage of a rare Carlos Correa misplay. The Twins appeared to have pinch runner Jos\u00e9 Caballero caught attempting to steal, but the ball ticked off the shortstop's glove instead, letting him advance to third base.\n\nHe would then score the tying run on a soft Yandy D\u00edaz single.\n\nA Lewis home run in the fifth had out the Twins up 1-0, their first and only lead of the day -- and busted the ribbon board in left field.\n\nLewis smacked a home run at 108.7 mph off the screen, causing the section to go black. It's a price the Twins will surely be happy to pay considering the production they're getting from their hot-hitting third baseman, who now has eight home runs in 14 games played this season. Lewis finished the day with three of the Twins' nine hits.\n\nThe Twins scored their only other run in the third inning when Austin Martin scored on Trevor Larnach's double play ball. That tied the game at the time after Isaac Paredes had hit a home run off starter Joe Ryan earlier in the inning.\n\nRyan, facing the organization that traded him as a minor leaguer years earlier, took a no-decision in a game in which he gave up just that run in his six innings pitched.", "source": {"uri": "twincities.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twin Cities"}, "authors": [{"uri": "betsy_helfand@twincities.com", "name": "Betsy Helfand", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royce Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Paul_Pioneer_Press", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Paul Pioneer Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Error (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Arozarena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Arozarena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandy_D\u00edaz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yandy D\u00edaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_runner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinch runner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Win\u2013loss record (pitching)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/STP-Z-TWINSPIX6-0620-01-01-01-01-02.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663724", "eventUri": "eng-9663724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Turns out, Jose Miranda wasn't quite ready to go home.\n\nMiranda connected with a slider and sent it out to left field for a three-run home run, electrifying the Target Field crowd and helping the Twins hit the reset button after falling behind by four runs late in the game.\n\nBut while the Twins were able to complete three separate comebacks, their attempt at a fourth fell short in a 7-6, 10-inning loss to the Tampa Bay Rays on Thursday afternoon at Target Field.\n\nThe Rays went ahead for the final time in the top of the 10th inning with Jonny DeLuca's single off of Griffin Jax, bringing home the automatic runner. That helped dull some of the momentum that the Twins had drummed up by pulling themselves out of a large, late deficit.\n\nAnd in the bottom of the 10th inning, the Twins went down quickly.

Lopez then allowed a solo homer to Brandon Lowe in the fifth before he was pulled and Jay Jackson surrendered a solo shot to Josh Lowe.\n\nDown 6-4, Max Kepler led off the fifth inning with a solo homer and the Twins tied it following a rain delay on Ryan Jeffers' sacrifice fly that scored Carlos Correa.\n\nThe Twins' first runs of the night came in the fourth inning on a three-run triple by Willi Castro and an RBI double by Trevor Larnach.\n\nCorrea went 3-for-4 at the plate to continue his hot streak.

Phil Maton worked a 1-2-3 inning in the 10th for his second save, with closer Pete Fairbanks unavailable after the thumb on his throwing hand was bruised by a comebacker the night before.\n\nJorge Alcala (1-2) hit Randy Arozarena with a pitch to start the inning. He threw a sinker in the dirt so wildly it ricocheted off the backstop and right to catcher Christian V\u00e1zquez for a relatively easy throw-out of automatic runner Jose Siri at third.\n\nLewis, who snagged Siri's grounder with the bases loaded in the seventh and beat Amed Rosario to the bag for the inning-ending force out, fielded a sharp chopper by Jonny DeLuca to his left and sent his deep throw sailing past first baseman Carlos Santana that let Arozarena score the go-ahead run.\n\nLewis went 3 for 4 with a walk and a tiebreaking home run in the fifth inning that broke part of a videoboard at Target Field.\n\nIsaac Paredes hit his team-leading 11th home run in the third off Twins starter Joe Ryan, who sailed through six innings with a 2-1 lead before a bumpy performance by the bullpen. Ryan delivered another bid to make his first All-Star team, allowing one run on six hits and one walk.\n\nRyan, who was selected in the seventh round by the Rays in the same 2018 draft that fetched Bradley in the fifth round, was traded to the Twins in 2021 for 55 games of veteran slugger Nelson Cruz. The Rays lost in the division series of the playoffs about 2 1/2 months later.\n\nRays starter Taj Bradley gave up two runs on seven hits and two walks in six innings.\n\nLewis hit his eighth homer in 14 games since returning from a severely strained quadriceps muscle suffered in the season opener. With an exit velocity measured at 108.7 mph, this one ricocheted off the ribbon board that fronts the second deck above left field -- and appeared to knock out a long section of LED lights that used to depict the rotating advertisements. The red Budweiser logos that were up at the time wound up with a blank black splotch, as did the rest that followed.\n\nYandy Diaz tied the game with the softest of singles, a swinging bunt of sorts that dribbled down the third-base line where Lewis had no play.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nFairbanks played catch without any problems before the game, after his minor injury on Tuesday. He said he feels normal and expects to be available for action by Thursday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Rays will send RHP Zack Littell (2-5, 4.24 ERA) to the mound for the series finale on Thursday afternoon, opposite Twins rookie RHP Simeon Woods Richardson (2-1, 3.29 ERA). Littell made his major league debut with the Twins in 2018, after being acquired from the Yankees in a trade the year before.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Even after 15 major league seasons, with his 2,000th career game just days away, the veteran first baseman lobbies manager Rocco Baldelli to play.\n\n\"Honestly, he's ready for anything. The other day, in a doubleheader, it's 90 degrees outside, he's talking me into playing him in Game 2,\" Baldelli said before the game. \"That's his mentality, he wants to be out there all the time.\"\n\nHe utilized a smart tactic to accomplish it on Tuesday -- he made himself essential.\n\nSantana, serving as a pinch-hitter on, yes, a dreaded day off, waited on a 1-1 curveball in the bottom of the ninth inning, pulled it into right field and became the walk-off hero as Manuel Margot scored from second base, handing the Twins their sixth straight victory, 7-6 over the Rays at soggy Target Field.\n\nThe winning hit came against Rays reliever Phil Maton, Tampa Bay's eighth pitcher of the night, who had to take over for closer Pete Fairbanks when Carlos Correa's one-hop come-backer hit Fairbanks' pitching hand and the righthander couldn't continue.\n\nThe victory was an especially satisfying one for the Twins, who overcame a 4-0 deficit that Pablo L\u00f3pez found himself in, a problem wrought by a critical home run by Randy Arozarena.\n\nL\u00f3pez is certainly used to the problem. The Twins' nominal ace moved into the MLB lead in home runs allowed on Tuesday, having surrendered 16 in 80 innings this season. Five of them have come in the first inning, just one away from the lead.\n\nThe game began with thunder audible in the distance and the skies growing darker, so the teams understood that a delay was likely. The mood grew even darker once the Rays began pelting L\u00f3pez; three of the first five hitters the righthander faced hammered the ball at least 103.5 mph.\n\nOne was Yandy Diaz's leadoff fly out, but Brandon Lowe hit a 106-mph grounder up the middle for a single. After Isaac Paredes drew a walk, Randy Arozarena gave Tampa Bay a 3-0 lead by bashing L\u00f3pez's first pitch, an 88-mph changeup in the middle of the plate, into the second deck in left field, his 10th of the season.\n\nThe Rays increased the lead to four runs when the top of the lineup came up again, this time behind a pair of infield singles by Diaz and Paredes, and an RBI hit to right by Josh Lowe.\n\nThe Twins finally struck back in the fourth inning, following a leadoff single by Carlos Correa, who had already doubled two innings earlier. Two quick outs made it look like any rally would fizzle, but Ryan Jeffers lined a single to right, and Austin Martin walked, loading the bases.\n\nThat brought up Willi Castro, one of the Twins' hottest hitters, and he cleared the bases with a line drive that stayed just inside the right-field foul line and rolled into the corner for a double. Martin slid home just ahead of the relay throw, and Castro scored the tying run moments later when Trevor Larnach looped a sinking liner into the left-field corner for another double.\n\nOnce the Rays returned to the plate, there was only time for one more batter to face L\u00f3pez before the rains arrived. Unfortunately, Brandon Lowe was that batter, and he smashed an 0-2 sweeper into the first row of seats high atop the wall in right-center.\n\nThe game resumed an hour and 23 minutes later, this time with Jay Jackson on the mound, and his luck with a Lowe on an 0-2 count -- this one Josh, the DH -- was no better. He golfed slider below the strike zone onto the grass berm in center field.\n\nBut again, the Twins struck back quickly -- two-pitches quickly, in fact. Max Kepler, who earlier in the homestand became Target Field's all-time home-run leader, added No. 82 to his total, smacking an inside fastball from righthander Shawn Armstrong onto that same berm.\n\nCarlos Correa followed by drawing a walk, moved up on Jose Miranda's hit and a potential double play foiled by Byron Buxton's speed, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Ryan Jeffers.", "source":

Phil Maton worked a 1-2-3 inning in the 10th for his second save, with closer Pete Fairbanks unavailable after the thumb on his throwing hand was bruised by a comebacker the night before.\n\nJorge Alcala (1-2) hit Randy Arozarena with a pitch to start the inning. He threw a sinker in the dirt so wildly it ricocheted off the backstop and right to catcher Christian V\u00e1zquez for a relatively easy throw-out of automatic runner Jose Siri at third.\n\nLewis, who snagged Siri's grounder with the bases loaded in the seventh and beat Amed Rosario to the bag for the inning-ending force out, fielded a sharp chopper by Jonny DeLuca to his left and sent his deep throw sailing past first baseman Carlos Santana that let Arozarena score the go-ahead run.\n\nLewis went 3 for 4 with a walk and a tiebreaking home run in the fifth inning that broke part of a videoboard at Target Field.\n\nIsaac Paredes hit his team-leading 11th home run in the third off Twins starter Joe Ryan, who sailed through six innings with a 2-1 lead before a bumpy performance by the bullpen. Ryan delivered another bid to make his first All-Star team, allowing one run on six hits and one walk.\n\nRyan, who was selected in the seventh round by the Rays in the same 2018 draft that fetched Bradley in the fifth round, was traded to the Twins in 2021 for 55 games of veteran slugger Nelson Cruz. The Rays lost in the division series of the playoffs about 2\u00bd months later.\n\nRays starter Taj Bradley gave up two runs on seven hits and two walks in six innings.\n\nLewis hit his eighth homer in 14 games since returning from a severely strained quadriceps muscle suffered in the season opener. With an exit velocity measured at 108.7 mph, this one ricocheted off the ribbon board that fronts the second deck above left field -- and appeared to knock out a long section of LED lights that used to depict the rotating advertisements. The red Budweiser logos that were up at the time wound up with a blank black splotch, as did the rest that followed.\n\nIn 90 career major league games, including the playoffs, Lewis has hit 29 homers with 74 RBIs.\n\nCole Sands relieved Ryan for the seventh and surrendered a one-out bloop single to Ben Rortvedt before pinch-runner Jose Caballero stole second base and took third when shortstop Carlos Correa let the throw bounce out of his glove and into center field.\n\nYandy Diaz tied the game with the softest of singles, a swinging bunt of sorts that dribbled down the third-base line where Lewis had no play.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nFairbanks played catch without any problems before the game after his minor injury on Tuesday. He said he feels normal and expects to be available for action by Thursday.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Rays will send RHP Zack Littell (2-5, 4.24 ERA) to the mound for the series finale on Thursday afternoon, opposite Twins rookie RHP Simeon Woods Richardson (2-1, 3.29 ERA). Littell made his major league debut with the Twins in 2018 after being acquired from the Yankees in a trade the year before.\n\nIn just four months, a new Florida law would make it illegal for people to sleep in public spaces or parks. State leaders who support the bill say it will help push people who need help into shelters and programs, but Aaron Swift with the Homeless Leadership Alliance of Pinellas said that could cause more issues.\n\nHomeless shelters prepare for increase in need because of new Florida law\n\nUSF sprinter Saminu Abdul-Rasheed continues at top speed\n\nKevin Lewis\n\n3:27 PM, Jun 19, 2024\n\nFirst HBCU

But on Wednesday, runs were at a premium, and a couple of defensive mistakes ended up leading to the end of the Twins' winning streak.\n\nAnother costly error helped the Rays tie the game in the seventh, taking advantage of a rare Carlos Correa misplay. The Twins appeared to have pinch runner Jos\u00e9 Caballero caught attempting to steal, but the ball ticked off the shortstop's glove instead, letting him advance to third base.\n\nHe would then score the tying run on a soft Yandy D\u00edaz single.\n\nA Lewis home run in the fifth had out the Twins up 1-0, their first and only lead of the day -- and busted the ribbon board in left field.\n\nLewis smacked a home run at 108.7 mph off the screen, causing the section to go black. It's a price the Twins will surely be happy to pay considering the production they're getting from their hot-hitting third baseman, who now has eight home runs in 14 games played this season. Lewis finished the day with three of the Twins' nine hits.\n\nThe Twins scored their only other run in the third inning when Austin Martin scored on Trevor Larnach's double play ball. That tied the game at the time after Isaac Paredes had hit a home run off starter Joe Ryan earlier in the inning.\n\nRyan, facing the organization that traded him as a minor leaguer years earlier, took a no-decision in a game in which he gave up just that run in his six innings pitched.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yandy_D\u00edaz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yandy D\u00edaz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_runner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinch runner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Win\u2013loss record (pitching)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_played", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Games played"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663724", "eventUri": "eng-9663724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Tampa Bay Rays center fielder Jose Siri called off his teammate for the ball, then roped a throw to third base, tossing out Royce Lewis for a critical double play. Ryan Jeffers followed with a single that might well have scored Lewis from second before Carlos Santana flew out to end the game.\n\nThe Twins, for the second consecutive day at a damp Target Field, were handed an extra-innings loss to the Rays, dropping a 7-6 thriller. Jonny DeLuca drove in the game-winning run in the top of the 10th inning with a one-out single off Griffin Jax.\n\nThe Twins trailed by four runs when they entered the bottom of the ninth inning, but Santana cut the lead to 6-3 with a leadoff home run. With two outs and two runners on, Miranda saw four sliders from Pete Fairbanks, a closer that had blown only one save in 11 opportunities this year, and he lifted the last one past the left-field wall.\n\nSantana started the wild rally with a solo homer off Rays reliever Chris Devenski, his 12th homer of the season tying him for the team lead with Ryan Jeffers. Byron Buxton followed with a double and Austin Martin drew a walk before Fairbanks entered.\n\nIt was a 2-2 game in the eighth inning. Twins lefty reliever Steven Okert surrendered a go-ahead RBI double to Amed Rosario, a pinch hitter who was hitless in his last 17 at-bats, and Jay Jackson yielded homers to Jose Siri and Yandy D\u00edaz in the top of the ninth inning.\n\nThe Twins finished their homestand with a 7-3 record.\n\nLewis, who was on deck for Miranda's game-tying homer and ended the ninth inning with a flyout to the left field warning track, launched an inside splitter from ex-Twins pitcher Zack Littell in the third inning for a solo homer to left field. His nine homers are a franchise record, the most by any player in his first 15 games of the season.\n\nAfter homering for the fourth time in the last five games, Lewis has 26 homers in 85 career games. There are only six players who totaled more homers in their first 85 games, according to MLB researcher Sarah Langs: Rudy York (31), Mark McGwire (30), Jose Abreu (29), Pete Alonso (28), Cody Bellinger (28) and Yordan Alvarez (27).\n\nThis was a rare Lewis homer that wasn't a no-doubter off the bat, delaying his celebration until the ball cleared the wall. He admitted he rarely watches where his home runs land. Once he feels it off the bat, he'll immediately turn toward teammates in the dugout to pump them up.\n\nHe was unaware he broke a section of a ribbon board -- the facing of the second deck -- with a home run Wednesday. The ribbon board was fixed for Thursday's game.\n\n\"My thing is just enjoy the game and have as much fun as possible,\" Lewis said. \"It's a blessing to be here every day. I could watch it later. My friends can send it to me -- usually my grandma [does] from Twitter.\"\n\nTwins starter Simeon Woods Richardson limited the Rays offense to two runs and four hits in six innings with six strikeouts, matching his second-highest total in a start this season.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It was the Twins' first extra-inning loss in four attempts this year.\n\nThe Twins had already caught a break in the 10th inning. After Jorge Alcala hit Arozarena with a pitch, giving him two runners on base with none out, he had a wild pitch that rebounded from the backstop directly to catcher Christian V\u00e1zquez. Jose Siri, the automatic runner at second base, was tossed out trying to advance to third.\n\nLewis' error, however, gave it away.\n\nIn the fifth inning, Lewis received a cutter over the heart of the plate in a 1-2 count from Rays righthander Taj Bradley, and he drilled it to the facing of the second deck in left field. The ball left his bat at 109 mph, the hardest-hit ball of the game, and it broke the section of the ribbon video board it hit.\n\nLiteral lights-out power.\n\nTurning into the modern-day version of Roy Hobbs, Lewis let out a yell and looked at his teammates in the dugout when he began his home run trot. His eight homers in his first 14 games of the season are a team record, one more than Byron Buxton (2022) and Harmon Killebrew (1961).\n\nIn the seventh inning, after Cole Sands replaced Ryan, Ben Rortvedt hit a one-out single and Jos\u00e9 Caballero entered as a pinch runner. Caballero swiped second base and advanced to third when Twins shortstop Carlos Correa missed catcher Christian V\u00e1zquez's throw attempting a quick tag.\n\nThe extra base was costly to the Twins because Caballero scored the game-tying run on a soft dribbler to third base. Steven Okert took over for Sands after the infield hit, and he left the bases loaded after walking an additional batter.\n\nTwins reliever Josh Staumont, who hasn't allowed an earned run this season, walked three batters in the eighth inning, but he escaped after Yandy D\u00edaz lined out to left field with the bases loaded.\n\nRyan yielded one run and six hits in six innings. Isaac Paredes, the Rays' third baseman, hit a solo homer to left field in the third inning, connecting on an inside splitter, and he was the only runner Ryan allowed to reach third base. Rays hitters had trouble with Ryan's fastball, whiffing on 12 of their 27 swings against the pitch.\n\nIt was nearly three years ago when the Twins acquired Ryan in a trade with the Rays for two months of Nelson Cruz. Ryan was still a prospect, pitching in Class AAA, and he's transformed into a solid mid-rotation starter. He used to rely on his 91-92 mph fastballs without much offspeed pitches, and now he's averaging more than 94 on his fastball with a strong splitter, two versions of his slider and a sinker.\n\n\"He can just take a baseball and throw it where he wants to throw it better than 95% of the pitchers in the big leagues, Twins Manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"He just has that ability. He can change his delivery. He can put the ball where he wants it better than other people. That's a great place to start.

That proved to be enough to sneak out the victory.\n\nPhil Maton sent Lewis, Max Kepler and Carlos Correa down in order in the bottom to close it out.\n\nThe Rays (35-39) tied the game at 2-2 during the seventh inning when Cole Sands came on in relief of Ryan. Sands quickly got the first out of the inning but then surrendered a single to Ben Rortvedt, issued a walk to Taylor Walls before Yandy Diaz hit an RBI infield single to knot the game.\n\nSteven Okert then relieved Sands and escaped the inning without allowing any additional damage despite issuing a walk to Isaac Paredes that loaded the bases.\n\nThe Twins (41-33) found themselves in a jam again in the eighth inning when Josh Staumont issued back-to-back walks to Arozarena and Richie Palacios. After striking out DeLuca and getting Rortvedt to ground into a fielder's choice, he then walked Taylor Walls to load the bases.\n\nBut Staumont got Diaz to fly out to left field to get out of the inning.\n\nThe Rays struck first during the third inning when Ryan had his only blemish of the day, giving up a 359-foot solo homer to Paredes. Ryan gave up six hits in all while fanning five in his six innings.\n\nThe Twins tied it at 1-1 during the bottom of the inning when Austin Martin led off the frame with a single, Willi Castro followed up with a single to advance him to third base and Trevor Larnach grounded into a 3-6 double play that scored Martin.\n\nLewis plated the go-ahead run during the fifth inning with a 410-foot solo homer to left field that bounced off the second deck videoboard, causing portions of it to go dark. Lewis remained lights out -- literally -- at the plate, going 3 for 4 with the homer, two singles and an intentional walk.\n\nThe Twins and Rays meet for the finale of their three-game series at 12:10

Tampa Bay (36-39) improved to a Major League-best 26-11 in games decided by two runs or fewer.\n\nSantana led off the bottom of the ninth with a home run to right, and Minnesota put runners at first and second with no outs.\n\nThen came Miranda's three-run blast against Fairbanks (2-3), who earned the win in his first appearance since exiting Tuesday's game with a right-thumb contusion on his throwing hand. Miranda sent a slider into the left-center field bleachers after Byron Buxton doubled down the left-field line and Kyle Farmer walked.\n\nJax (3-3) took the loss for Minnesota, which finished a 10-game home stand 7-3 and dropped its second straight after a six-game winning streak.\n\nAt times, Tampa Bay handled starter Simeon Woods Richardson's fastball and slider, tallying four doubles against the No. 5 man in the Twins rotation. But Woods Richardson, who had started just one Major League game before this season, repeatedly worked out of trouble with six strikeouts and two earned runs on four hits in six innings.\n\n\"I don't do this very often, but that's a nine out of 10,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said before Thursday's game when asked to rate Woods Richardson's performance this season. \"Like, how can it how can it be that much better? He's pitched so competitively, almost every single start that he's been out there, and he really solidified our rotation in a time where we needed it.\"\n\nMaking his second start against the club with which he made his Major League debut in 2018, Rays starter Zack Littell struck out five batters and allowed two earned runs on five hits in five innings. Neither he nor Woods Richardson factored into the decision.\n\nMinnesota had acquired Littell, then a reliever, from the Yankees in a trade for pitcher Jaime Garc\u00eda. Littell left the Twins via free agency in 2020 and had stints with San Francisco, Texas and Boston before the Rays claimed him off waivers and made him a starter last May.\n\nLewis' 373-foot home run to left field made it 2-2 in the third. The Twins designated hitter's ninth homer in 15 games spared the Target Field infrastructure this time; Lewis' home run Wednesday night in a 3-2, 10-inning loss had damaged the left-field ribbon board, causing a chunk of it to go dark.\n\nIt was already repaired when fans began arriving Thursday morning.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nTwins: Starting right fielder Max Kepler left the game with neck spasms after sliding into first on a first-inning bunt attempt. ... Shortstop Carlos Correa and outfielder Willi Castro were held out of the starting lineup but both pinch hit Thursday.

Not even a long stoppage in the middle of the game.\n\nThough the Twins started off slow on Tuesday night at Target Field, they awakened after a lengthy rain delay, then completed the comeback with a 7-6 win over the Tampa Bay Rays. Carlos Santana played hero, pinch-hitting for Jose Miranda in the ninth inning and promptly hitting a single to center field to score Manny Margot from second base.\n\nThe dramatic finish helped the Twins extend their winning streak to six games as they continue to chase the Cleveland Guardians for supremacy in the AL Central.\n\nIt wasn't the cleanest of outings for Pablo Lopez before the rain delay, which spanned 1 hour, 23 minutes. He surrendered a three-run homer in the first inning, another run in the third and a solo homer in the fifth before the skies opened up. He was lifted from the game in favor of Jay Jackson when play resumed.\n\nGiven the way Lopez has carried the Twins at times over the past couple of seasons, it's only right that his teammates picked him up on a rare occasion that he wasn't at the peak of his powers.\n\nThe Twins responded thanks to some timely hitting by Willi Castro. He stepped into the batter's box in the fourth inning with the bases loaded and tripled to right, scoring Carlos Correa, Ryan Jeffers and Austin Martin. That cut the deficit to 4-3, and Trevor Larnach doubled to left field shortly thereafter to score Castro and tie the score at 4-4.\n\nThat score wouldn't hold, as the Rays got a solo home run from Brandon Lowe right before the rain delay and a solo home run from designated hitter Josh Lowe right after the rain delay.\n\nFortunately for the Twins, Max Kepler followed suit the next time he was at the plate, making it 6-5 with a solo home run of his own. Not long after that, Correa drew a walk and eventually came around to score on a sacrifice fly by Jeffers to tie the score at 6-6.\n\nAside from Jackson out of the bullpen, the Twins also got solid efforts from Jorge Alcala, Griffin Jax, and Jhoan Duran in relief.\n\nThat set the stage for Santana. He watched a couple of pitches whizz by him, then casually barreled up a ball to lift the Twins to a win.", "source": {"uri": "twincities.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twin Cities"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dane_mizutani@twincities.com", "name": "Dane Mizutani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Jackson_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jay Jackson (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_Jax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Griffin Jax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Jeffers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Jeffers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Larnach", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Larnach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Lowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Lowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kepler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Kepler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ervin_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ervin Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24171028728614.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663724", "eventUri": "eng-9663724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Carlos Santana's futile dive couldn't keep the ball from bouncing into foul ground as Arozarena made it home from second.\n\nJason Adam (4-1) worked a 1-2-3 ninth inning to earn the win and Phil Maton did the same in the 10th to earn his second save, retiring Carlos Correa on a flyout to left to strand the tying run at second. Jorge Alcala (1-2) was saddled with the loss.\n\nNeither starter was involved in the decision despite logging quality starts. Tampa Bay's Taj Bradley scattered seven hits and allowed two runs in six innings with two walks and three strikeouts. Minnesota's Joe Ryan permitted six hits and a run in six innings, walking one and striking out five.\n\nRyan was in line for the win before the Rays tied the score in the seventh. Yandy Diaz hit an infield single down the third base line that scored pinch runner Jose Caballero, who reached third on his American League-high 23rd steal and an error.\n\nTampa Bay initiated scoring in the top of the third. Ryan caught too much of the plate with a 2-1 fastball to Isaac Paredes. He lined it inside the left field foul pole for his team-high 11th homer of the year and his first in June.\n\nThat lead didn't last long. Minnesota tied the score in its half of the third.

Lewis hit his eighth homer of the year, rifling a 2-2 cutter an estimated 410 feet off the facing of the second deck in left.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Adam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Adam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Arozarena", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randy Arozarena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royce Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Error (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Maton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Maton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Larnach", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Larnach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infield_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infield hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_runner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinch runner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fidel Castro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663724", "eventUri": "eng-9663724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

They didn't realize the correlation between the homer and the outage.\n\n\"I had no idea it was from me, no,\" said Lewis, who has the most home runs in Twins history in a player's first 14 games of a season. \"It's funny, I feel it off the bat now, and I have a good idea that it\u00b4s probably gone. I\u00b4m just looking at my teammates to amp them up and get them going. I think they love it just as much as I do now, so just trying to get the boys going.\"\n\nThis one wasn't quite Roy Hobbs busting the light bulbs by homering in his last at-bat in the movie \"The Natural,\" but the videoboard-breaker was yet another highlight to add to the long list of them for the ebullient first overall pick in the 2017 draft.\n\nMinnesota Twins' Royce Lewis celebrates while running the bases after hitting a solo home run during the fifth inning of a baseball game against the Tampa Bay Rays, Wednesday, June 19, 2024, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)\n\nLewis, who went 3 for 4 with a walk and is batting .380 with a .439 on-base percentage and a .900 slugging percentage this season, has hit 29 homers with 74 RBIs in 90 career major league games including the playoffs.\n\nWith an exit velocity measured at 108.7 mph off a 2-2 cutter from Rays right-hander Taj Bradley, this one ricocheted off the ribbon board that fronts the second deck above left field. Seconds later, a long section of LED lights used to depict the rotating advertisements went dark. The red Budweiser logos that were up at the time wound up with a blank black splotch, as did the rest of the ads that followed.\n\n\"When he finds the barrel, you hear that kind of piercing snap,\" manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"He finds the barrel more often than most and when it leaves the bat, a lot of the time there\u00b4s not really a question. You feel pretty good about it as it\u00b4s leaving the bat. It was another good swing by him. He\u00b4s having a lot of very meaningful at-bats. He\u00b4s doing a lot of very, very positive things for us at the plate right now. We\u00b4ve seen that a lot from him already in the couple weeks he\u00b4s been playing, and I keep saying it: 'More to come.\u00b4 There\u00b4s no reason why there shouldn\u00b4t be more to come.\"\n\nLewis stopped an 0-for-7 skid with a single in the first inning.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t do that slump thing,\" he said, recalling a conversation earlier in the day with teammate Pablo L\u00f3pez. \"That\u00b4s not a real thing for me.\"\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royce Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Natural", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Natural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Error (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exit velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_L\u00f3pez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pablo L\u00f3pez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Baldelli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocco Baldelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/20/06/wire-86351957-1718860628-379_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663724", "eventUri": "eng-9663724", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 1541, "textEnd": 1548}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

In situations like this, you typically feel like the world is caving in and you are searching for any victory that you can find. The only victory I can think of right now is that I'm still up on the season. Maybe one other is that I'm determined to get my money back, and I refuse to give up. Moral victories don't line our pockets or allow us to buy any cool stuff, so I need to turn it around and I am confident that I will do so sooner rather than later. Sometimes you need to weather the storm, but I am hopeful I can get to smooth sailing in this game between the Rays and Twins.\n\nThis clearly isn't the best Rays team or season they've had, but they are fairly competitive for the season. If the offense could start to hit a little more consistently, they would probably be a team sitting above .500 rather than living below like they are right now. The team is currently only hitting .232 for the season and only has 285 runs for the year. That puts the team with fewer than four runs scored per game. That puts an immense amount of pressure on the pitching staff to be perfect and in a year without Tyler Glasnow (traded to the Dodgers in the offseason) and Shane McClanahan (injured), there isn't much opportunity for perfection. Although you can't blame the offense's struggle on one person, Randy Arozarena is certainly the one who will draw the most criticism. Arozarena does lead the team in home runs, but he is hitting just .179 for the season. If he can get hot, I'd expect the Rays to jump up the standings at least a little bit. Today, they have Zack Littell going for the Rays. Littell is 2-5 with a 4.24 ERA and a 1.38 WHIP. Those numbers aren't terrible, but they also aren't front of the staff numbers. No one is trying to say Littell is an Ace, either. He had a nice stretch of three straight quality starts, but he followed that with his worst outing of the season as he only lasted two innings against the Braves and allowed six earned runs. He has allowed seven home runs in his last six games. Twins hitters are just 6-for-26 against him with only one extra-base hit.\n\nThe Twins are above .500 and last season that was essentially all they needed to do in order to get into the playoffs and win the AL Central. This season, not quite as much. The Guardians and Royals are both playing very good baseball and realistic contenders for the division this season. Even the Tigers are fairly hot on the heels of the Twins. The White Sox are still in professional baseball, but I wouldn't say they actually play professional baseball. The Twins are playing great right now as well and putting together a very nice run as we rapidly approach the midway point of the season. The hitting has been surprisingly good this season with the club hitting .245 and in the top-10 of runs scored for the year. I feel like the offense has been an issue in the past few years, but they are taking nice strides this season. The pitching staff has taken a bit of a step back with a 4.24 ERA and a 1.21 WHIP. Today they have one of their better starters going with Simeon Woods Richardson taking the hill. For the season he is just 2-1 with a 3.29 ERA and a 1.15 WHIP. He is coming off of a somewhat rough start, going just four innings and allowing four earned runs. This was just the second time that he allowed four or more runs this season, so it is somewhat rare considering this will be his 12th start of the year. He has never faced the Rays and does a fairly decent job of limiting the damage the first time through the lineup.\n\nThis pitching matchup seems a bit more evenly matched than some of the numbers indicate. Woods Richardson has been a good pitcher, but Littell finds ways to keep most offenses from scoring a ridiculous amount. I think overall the game should be an under. I expect both of the pitchers to rebound from the previously poor outings they had. I'll take the under. I do lean toward the Twins winning this game as well.\n\nFor more sports betting information and plays, follow David on X/Twitter: @futureprez2024", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_troy@outkick.com", "name": "David Troy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_McClanahan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shane McClanahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Arozarena", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Randy Arozarena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Littell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zack Littell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/Simeon-Woods-Richardson-Minnesota-Twins-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663724", "eventUri": "eng-9663724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Tampa Bay (36-39) improved to a Major League-best 26-11 in games decided by two runs or fewer.\n\nIn the bottom of the extra inning, Siri caught pinch hitter Carlos Correa's fly-out to center field and then gunned down Royce Lewis at third for a double play. Closer Pete Fairbanks coaxed another center-field fly out from Santana to end the game.\n\nThe Rays and Twins (41-34) had spent most of a rainy afternoon deadlocked before Richie Palacios pinch-ran for Isaac Paredes, who had reached on a single. Palacios then stole second before coming home on pinch hitter Amed Rosario's left-field double to break a 2-2 tie.\n\nSiri and Yandy D\u00edaz added insurance home runs in the ninth inning off Jay Jackson to give Tampa Bay a seemingly commanding advantage.\n\nSantana led off the bottom of the ninth with a home run to right, and Minnesota put runners at first and second with no outs.\n\nThen came Miranda's three-run blast against Fairbanks (2-3), who earned the win in his first appearance since exiting Tuesday's game with a right-thumb contusion on his throwing hand. Miranda sent a slider into the left-center field bleachers after Byron Buxton doubled down the left-field line and Kyle Farmer walked.\n\nJax (3-3) took the loss for Minnesota, which finished a 10-game homestand 7-3 and dropped its second straight after a six-game winning streak.\n\nAt times, Tampa Bay handled starter Simeon Woods Richardson's fastball and slider, tallying four doubles against the No. 5 man in the Twins rotation. But Woods Richardson, who had started just one Major League game before this season, repeatedly worked out of trouble with six strikeouts and two earned runs on four hits in six innings.\n\n\"I don't do this very often, but that's a nine out of 10,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said before Thursday's game when asked to rate Woods Richardson's performance this season. \"Like, how can it how can it be that much better? He's pitched so competitively, almost every single start that he's been out there, and he really solidified our rotation in a time where we needed it.\"\n\nMaking his second start against the club with which he made his Major League debut in 2018, Rays starter Zack Littell struck out five batters and allowed two earned runs on five hits in five innings. Neither he nor Woods Richardson factored into the decision.\n\nMinnesota had acquired Littell, then a reliever, from the Yankees in a trade for pitcher Jaime Garc\u00eda. Littell left the Twins via free agency in 2020 and had stints with San Francisco, Texas and Boston before the Rays claimed him off waivers and made him a starter last May.\n\nLewis' 373-foot home run to left field made it 2-2 in the third. The Twins designated hitter's ninth homer in 15 games spared the Target Field infrastructure this time; Lewis' home run Wednesday night in a 3-2, 10-inning loss had damaged the left-field ribbon board, causing a chunk of it to go dark.\n\nIt was already repaired when fans began arriving Thursday morning.", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando

Turns out, Jose Miranda wasn't quite ready to go home.\n\nMiranda connected with a slider and sent it out to left field for a three-run home run, electrifying the Target Field crowd and helping the Twins hit the reset button after falling behind by four runs late in the game.\n\nBut while the Twins were able to complete three separate comebacks and force extra innings, their attempt at a fourth fell short in a 7-6, 10-inning loss to the Tampa Bay Rays on Thursday afternoon at Target Field.\n\n\"The last three days were pretty well played on both sides overall,\" manager Rocco Baldelli said. \" ... One play in each game really ends up deciding the outcome. Our guys played hard. We fought back again really valiantly.\"\n\nThe Rays (36-39) went ahead for the final time in the top of the 10th inning with Jonny DeLuca's single off of Griffin Jax bringing home the automatic runner. That helped dull some of the momentum that the Twins (41-34) had drummed up by pulling themselves out of a large, late deficit.\n\nAnd in the bottom of the 10th inning, the Twins went down quickly. Their own automatic runner, Royce Lewis, was thrown out after attempting to advance to third a Carlos Correa fly ball to center fielder Jose Siri.\n\n\"You need an unbelievable throw,\" Lewis said. \"When someone is going to their left from center field towards right field, I mean, I have nothing to say but to tip my cap.\"\n\nThe loss came after the Twins rallied back in both the second and third innings, as well.\n\nTheir second run of the game, which tied the score at the time, came on Lewis's ninth home run in 15 games this season as the third baseman continues his torrid start to the season.\n\n\"What he's doing right now is unreal,\" Miranda said. \"He's just from another world right now.\"\n\nBut the Twins never led, and things started to get away from them in the late innings.\n\nAmed Rosario broke open a 2-2 tie with a double off Steven Okert to bring home Richie Palacios in the eighth inning. The Twins were still within a run until the ninth inning, when Jay Jackson surrendered a pair of home runs, putting them down four.\n\nJackson was designated for assignment for the second time this season after the game and the Twins will make a corresponding move before their next series begins Friday in Oakland.\n\nCarlos Santana, appearing in his 1,999th career game, led off the ninth inning with a home run, and the Twins strung together a collection of good at-bats before Miranda's big blast sent the game to extras where the Twins fell for the second straight day.\n\n\"It's tough,\" Miranda said. \"Especially a game like that, we were down 6-2 last inning and we couldn't finish having the W. ... You've just got to come back tomorrow.\"\n\nMax Kepler left the game with neck spasms after trying to bunt for a hit and sliding headfirst into first base in the first inning. The right fielder said his neck flared up when he was on deck but he thought it was too late to ask to be subbed out, which is why he bunted.\n\nHe slid, he said, because \"the competitive side\" of him took over.\n\n\"It's a little stiff now when I look to my right, but the docs and trainers said it's just muscular and it should clear up with(in) a couple days,\" Kepler said.", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Target Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocco_Baldelli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocco Baldelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_Jax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Griffin Jax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Correa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Correa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royce Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_Palacios", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richie Palacios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Kepler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Kepler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amed_Rosario", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amed Rosario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Okert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Okert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bunt (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_for_assignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Designated for assignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Santana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Santana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple_Births", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Multiple Births", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/3e26095/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3594x2396+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fb5%2F34%2Fad83a19c4a99986bac9b04298405%2F2024-06-20t193658z-1554597291-mt1usatoday23587113-rtrmadp-3-mlb-tampa-bay-rays-at-minnesota-twins.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663724", "eventUri": "eng-9663724", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 456619632, "relevance": 2}

Tampa Bay (36-39) improved to a Major League Baseball-best 26-11 in games decided by two runs or fewer.\n\nIn the bottom of the extra inning, Siri caught pinch hitter Carlos Correa's fly out to center field and then gunned down Royce Lewis at third for a double play. Closer Pete Fairbanks coaxed another center-field fly out from Santana to end the game.\n\nThe Rays and Twins (41-34) had spent most of a rainy afternoon deadlocked before Richie Palacios came in to pinch-run for Isaac Paredes, who had reached on a single. Palacios then stole second before coming home on pinch hitter Amed Rosario's left-field double to break a 2-2 tie.\n\nSiri and Yandy D\u00edaz added insurance home runs in the ninth inning off Jay Jackson to give Tampa Bay a seemingly commanding advantage.\n\nSantana led off the bottom of the ninth with a home run to right field, and Minnesota put runners at first and second with no outs.\n\nThen came Miranda's three-run blast against Fairbanks (2-3), who earned the win in his first appearance since exiting Tuesday's game with a right-thumb contusion on his throwing hand. Miranda sent a slider into the left-center field bleachers after Byron Buxton doubled down the left-field line and Kyle Farmer walked.\n\nJax (3-3) took the loss for Minnesota, which finished a 10-game home stand 7-3 and dropped its second straight after a six-game winning streak.\n\nAt times, Tampa Bay handled starter Simeon Woods Richardson's fastball and slider, tallying four doubles against the No. 5 man in the Twins rotation. But Woods Richardson, who had started just one major-league game before this season, repeatedly worked out of trouble with six strikeouts and two earned runs on four hits in six innings.\n\n\"I don't do this very often, but that's a nine out of 10,\" Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said before Thursday's game when asked to rate Woods Richardson's performance this season. \"Like, how can it be that much better? He's pitched so competitively, almost every single start that he's been out there, and he really solidified our rotation in a time where we needed it.\"\n\nMaking his second start against the club with which he made his debut in the majors during 2018, Rays starter Zack Littell struck out five batters and allowed two earned runs on five hits in five innings. Neither he nor Woods Richardson factored into the decision.\n\nMinnesota had acquired Littell, then a reliever, from the Yankees in a trade for pitcher Jaime Garc\u00eda. Littell left the Twins via free agency in 2020 and had stints with the San Francisco Giants, Texas Rangers and Boston Red Sox before the Rays claimed him off waivers and made him a starter last May.\n\nLewis' 373-foot home run to left field made it 2-2 in the third.\n\nTwins: Starting right fielder Max Kepler left the game with neck spasms after sliding into first on a first-inning bunt attempt. ... Correa and outfielder Willi Castro were held out of the starting lineup, but both pinch hit Thursday. Baldelli had hoped to give both players the day off ahead of Minnesota's nine-game road trip to close the month of June.\n\nRays: Right-handed pitcher Ryan Pepiot (4-4, 4.57 ERA) is scheduled to open Tampa Bay's three-game road series at Pittsburgh on Friday. The Pirates have yet to name a starter.\n\nTwins: Minnesota heads west for a nine-game road trip to Oakland, Arizona and Seattle. Right-hander Chris Paddack (5-3, 5.25 ERA) is expected to start Friday against A's RHP Joey Estes (2-2, 5.97).", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News

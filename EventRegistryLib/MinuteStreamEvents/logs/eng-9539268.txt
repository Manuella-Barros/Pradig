I always thought she was so beautiful. She has a unique look. But when she returned to the Derby in 2004 she was in her tip top shape,' he further remembered.\n\nLarry explained, 'She was blowing me kisses, but I thought she was doing that for everyone. Being flirtatious for the camera. I never thought that she would want some guy like me from Kentucky when she could have any guys who wants.'\n\nTheir budding romance soon began in 2004, and the photographer later moved in with the model at her Los Angeles home. However, she then moved to the Bahamas when she was pregnant with their daughter.\n\nAt the time, she was filtering through a legal battle for $30 million from her late husband and billionaire, J. Howard Marshall.\n\nThe two notably tied the knot in 1994 when he was 89, and she was only 26. However, just 14 months after their nuptials, he passed away.\n\n'We were living together and doing baby planning. We were picking out names for our baby. Despite what anyone says, Anna knew I was the father,' Larry expressed to DailyMail.com.\n\n'They took her to the Bahamas because she was in a lawsuit for all that money, and they thought that I was going to try and take it from her, so they saw me as a threat and Anna believed it.'\n\n'It was a game I had to play and go through the motions. But we stayed in contact until the time when she passed away,' Larry further continued.\n\nAfter welcoming Dannielynn in the Bahamas on September 7, 2006, her other child and only son, Daniel Wayne Smith, tragically died just days later on September 10 while visiting his mother and half-sister in the hospital due to a drug overdose.\n\nAbbie Cornish will play Smith in the upcoming movie Trust Me, I'm a Doctor. The film is based on a memoir of the same name by Anna Nicole's pain medication doctor Sandeep Kapoor, played by Kal Penn; Smith seen in 2005 in Los Angeles\n\nThe following year, when Dannielynn was only five-months-old, Smith passed away due to an accidental drug overdose.\n\nAfter her shocking death and following a custody battle, Larry was ruled as Dannielynn's biological father due to a DNA test.\n\nNot long after his daughter was born, Anna's lawyer, Howard K. Stern, had been assumed as the father, and the pair married during a ceremony in the Bahamas.\n\nBut after the DNA test proved Birkhead as the father, the birth certificate was changed and Dannielynn began living with him in the state of Kentucky, where they both still currently reside.\n\nCornish will play Smith in the upcoming movie Trust Me, I'm a Doctor. The film is based on a memoir of the same name by Anna Nicole's pain medication doctor Sandeep Kapoor, played by Kal Penn.\n\nAfter Anna Nicole died of an overdose, Sandeep was implicated in her wrongful death trial, but he was ultimately acquitted of all six counts against him.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dannielynn_Birkhead_paternity_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dannielynn Birkhead paternity case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Nicole_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anna Nicole Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Nicole", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anna Nicole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianfranco_Ferr\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gianfranco Ferr\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Janet Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black and white"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbie_Cornish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abbie Cornish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowler_hat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowler hat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug overdose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eve (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Photographer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_K._Stern", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Howard K.

(Smith died of a drug overdose in February 2007 at the age of 39, just five months after Dannielynn was born.)\n\n\"Sometimes you feel like a bodyguard, sometimes you feel like a chauffeur,\" Larry joked to Us Weekly in 2020 about being a single father. \"It depends on what the day is.

The outfit she chose from the \"All for You\" singer is a Gianfranco Ferre dress that is \"knee-length in the front and floor-length in the back and features zippers all around,\" per Julien's.\n\nBirkhead, who's attended the Kentucky Derby with his daughter since she was a toddler, has previously shared photos and videos of him hanging out with Dannielynn. Read on to learn more about some of their fun outings togheter.\n\nIn January, Birkhead posted a fun video of Dannielynn driving him around on a Disney attraction.\n\n\"Dannielynn trying to show me her 'driving skills' at ... Autotopia,\" he captioned the video. \"After a year of telling her to study for her driver's test and then her just being too lazy and 'busy' while at the same time telling me that she 'doesn't want to drive,' she decided to show me what she's got at Disney.\"\n\nIn the video shared by Birkhead, Dannielynn laughs as they careen around a racetrack. \"Keep it in the middle!\" the dad tells the teen.\n\n\"You don't understand -- it's going on its own!\" she exclaims. \"Oh my god, you're going to get pulled over ...\" he responds. \"My insurance is going to go crazy!\"\n\nBirkhead explained in his caption: \"She said she thought she had what it takes to pass her test, because she has been 'playing Mario Kart for years.' As you can see here, she needs a little help. Despite her claims of a 'riggedy' car, and not being able to find the brake, she said she's 'ready.'\"\n\nHe added, \"I told her when she can pass a quiz at home, then I would take her to get driver's lessons, because it makes me too nervous. Surely, you parents out there understand that! In her defense, the car was in need of some power steering fluid.\"\n\nAnna Nicole Smith (whose real name was Vickie Lynn Hogan) was a former exotic dancer turned model, most famous for her \"GUESS\" campaign and her controversial marriage to oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall II, who was 63 years her senior. Marshall's 1995 death sparked a battle over his fortune between Smith and his family.\n\nIn 2006, Smith gave birth to Dannielynn, shortly before her 20-year-old son Daniel died from ingesting methadone and antidepressants.

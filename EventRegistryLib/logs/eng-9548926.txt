Tuchel's potential appointment at United is bolstered by his achievements at Chelsea, including a Champions League final win against Manchester City in 2021. Tuchel's mixed season at Bayern does raise questions, but his success at Chelsea and willingness toward the United job are compelling.\n\nManchester United's search for a new manager appears to be hotting up with managerial targets being cited throughout the past week thanks to Erik ten Hag's misdemeanours in the past few months - and Thomas Tuchel is thought to \"want the job\" if he is approached by the Red Devils.\n\nA 4-0 drubbing to Crystal Palace on Monday only added to Ten Hag's woes, with the Dutchman suffering a run of just two wins in 10 Premier League games in recent weeks and having crashed out of the Carabao Cup and Champions League in the early stages, his only saving grace has been the FA Cup, where his side will face local rivals Manchester City in the final at the end of the month.\n\nThere continues to be more and more discourse surrounding a potential exit, which has seen the likes of Roberto De Zerbi linked in recent months. But one manager who could be in with a view of the hot seat is Thomas Tuchel - and with the current Bayern Munich boss departing at the end of the season, David Ornstein has claimed that Tuchel, who has been described as an 'unbelievable' manager, would seek a move to Old Trafford if Ten Hag left.\n\nThomas Tuchel: Manchester United Latest The German would be a good option for the Red Devils\n\nSpeaking on the Back Pages podcast on Wednesday morning, Ornstein claimed that Tuchel would be interested in the Red Devils job despite arguably their worst season in the Premier League era - with United as a brand failing to decline despite their dip in form. He said:\n\n\"When you're looking at these candidates, or potential candidates, our understanding is that Thomas Tuchel does want that job if there's a vacancy.\n\n\"For example, there will be others who are talked about - the likes of Graham Potter, Gareth Southgate and plenty more besides. I don't know of the shortlist that has apparently been drawn up.\n\n\"But the appeal of Manchester United to coaches and managers across the world is not going to go away because they've had a dip.\"\n\nTuchel's Chelsea Exploits Could Be of Use Tuchel won the Champions League with the Blues\n\nTuchel hasn't had the best season of his career with Bayer Leverkusen beating him on all fronts on the domestic scene, though he could still win a Champions League trophy should he overcome Real Madrid in the semi-final second leg on Wednesday evening and former club Borussia Dortmund in the final at the start of June.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Thomas Tuchel won 60 of his 100 games in charge of Chelsea in all competitions\n\nHis exploits with Chelsea, however, will resonate with Old Trafford chiefs the most if he is to take the vacancy at the Theatre of Dreams. Tuchel took over from Frank Lampard in January 2021 after a poor start to the season by the Blues legend, and having dragged them to the FA Cup and Champions League finals, he won the latter against the odds with a 1-0 win over Manchester City to cement his place in Chelsea history after just five months.\n\nTwo strong years at the helm saw Tuchel qualify in the top four both times, and he was unfortunate to lose all three of his domestic cup finals in a spell that could quite easily have seen him take four trophies in 18 months before being sacked. That run in itself would be enough to convince United fans that he is the man for the job, though this season's poor campaign at Bayern does shroud some doubt over whether he is the right choice at present.\n\nRelated Tuchel Wants to Replace Ten Hag at Man Utd After 'Contact' Sky Sports Germany reporter Florian Plettenberg says the Manchester United and Chelsea jobs both appeal to Thomas Tuchel.\n\nStatistics courtesy of Transfermarkt.

Outgoing Bayern Munich manager Tuchel has been linked with a move to Old Trafford to replace Erik ten Hag. Tuchel is reportedly keen to join United if the vacancy is available.\n\nManchester United expect talks with current Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel to progress as soon as this week with a view to the German taking over from Erik ten Hag at the end of the season, according to talkSPORT's Anil Kandola.\n\nTen Hag's departure from United is looking more likely at the conclusion of his second season in charge, with United set for their worst finish in Premier League history.\n\nTuchel, a Champions League winner with fellow Premier League club Chelsea, will step down as Bayern Munich boss in the summer which has put clubs from across Europe on red alert.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Ten Hag will keep his place in the hotseat at Old Trafford, but if the Dutchman was to leave Man Utd, Tuchel has been tipped as a potential suitor alongside the likes of Gareth Southgate, Graham Potter and Roberto De Zerbi.\n\nContact 'Will Progress' Between Man Utd and Tuchel\n\nTalkSPORT's Kandola revealed that negotiations with Tuchel and United are set to accelerate before the end of the season.\n\nHe wrote on social media:\n\n\"It's my understanding that contact between Manchester United and Thomas Tuchel will progress later this week, before Bayern's game against Wolfsburg.\n\n\"On a personal note, I'd be pleased to see Tuchel join United.\n\n\"A proven, no-nonsense winner. Would be good to see him at Old Trafford.\"\n\nTuchel Has 'Unfinished Business' In Premier League The former Chelsea boss would welcome a Premier League return\n\nTuchel was sacked by Chelsea early in the Todd Boehly era and was replaced by former Brighton boss Graham Potter. According to sports broadcaster Ben Jacobs, the reason for the German's dismissal is because he was \"not deemed a strategic fit\", but the stats show he was competing with the elite during his time at Stamford Bridge.\n\nOnly Manchester City (152) and Liverpool (136) picked up more points in the Premier League than Tuchel (122). Following Frank Lampard's sacking in 2021, Tuchel secured a top-four finish and reigned supreme in Europe, delivering the club's second Champions League trophy.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic : At the time of his departure, Thomas Tuchel had a 55.6% Premier League win percentage at Chelsea, the fourth highest in Blues' history among managers to have taken charge of at least 50 matches.\n\nDespite the results on the pitch, Tuchel was abruptly dismissed under Boehly to make way for long-term target Potter. But with the former Borussia Dortmund and Paris Saint-Germain boss set to leave Bayern, he is tempted by another crack at the English top-flight with Man Utd.\n\nJacobs gave an update on Wednesday and wrote on social media: \"Tuchel would welcome an approach if Erik ten Hag departs. He feels he has unfinished business in the EPL and remains upset at his Chelsea exit. Tuchel's sacking was down to not being deemed a strategic fit. Man Utd's new sporting model would likely suit his style and personality.\"\n\nStats: Tuchel vs Ten Hag in their respective divisions this season\n\nTuchel\n\nTen Hag\n\nMatches\n\n32\n\n35\n\nWins\n\n22\n\n16\n\nDraws\n\n3\n\n7\n\nLosses\n\n6\n\n13\n\nPoints\n\n69\n\n54\n\nPoints per match\n\n2.09\n\n1.58\n\nStats courtesy of TransferMarkt and FotMob, correct as of 08/05/2024\n\nRelated Thomas Tuchel 'Wants' to Replace Ten Hag at Man Utd Manchester United appear increasingly likely to appoint a new manager once the season ends and that could be Thomas Tuchel", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graham Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Boehly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Boehly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_De_Zerbi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roberto De Zerbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VfL_Wolfsburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "VfL Wolfsburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Lampard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Champion_Clubs'_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Champion Clubs' Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Darts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Darts/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/the-innovative-training-methods-thomas-tuchel-would-bring-to-man-utd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548926", "eventUri": "eng-9548926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5921568627450979, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

United have been in contact with the German manager recently, according to Sky Sports Germany. The pressure continues to grow on Erik ten Hag following the 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday.\n\nThomas Tuchel has been touted to make a Premier League return in the summer, with Sky Germany's Florian Plettenberg reporting that Chelsea and Manchester United present \"two appealing destinations\" for the German manager, with United making contact already.\n\nAs Bayern Munich's run of 11 straight years as Bundesliga Champions was brought to an end by Bayer Leverkusen's maiden title, Tuchel's Die Roten negotiations looked to stagnate with United most likely to hire the cap-wearing coach.\n\nManchester United Job Tempting for Tuchel\n\nPlettenberg reported via X on Monday that Tuchel was initially ready to carry on as Bayern boss and that talks were held. However, presumably faltering with domestic failure, the former Chelsea boss, who also sees Paris Saint-Germain and Borussia Dortmund on his resume, is now linked to a return to England's top-flight.\n\nManchester United have reportedly kept in contact with Tuchel - who Chelsea star Ben Chilwell labelled an \"unbelievable manager\" - following previous speculation - and with Monday night's 4-0 drubbing to Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, Erik ten Hag's reign has been put under even more scrutiny.\n\nThe Manchester Evening News reports that INEOS' Jim Ratcliffe has not been totally convinced by Ten Hag, and that he has opted to refrain from speaking publicly about the Dutchman. Tuchel's part in mutual \"loose contact\" shows that he is potentially interested in taking the job - and the media sphere has even begun to speculate about who he could take to Old Trafford as part of his project.\n\nUnited aren't the only project that has piqued the manager's interest, as old club Chelsea also seem \"appealing\", according to Plettenberg.\n\nCan United learn from Tuchel's past?\n\nWhile a return to the Premier League with Manchester United looks an interesting prospect for Tuchel, it's not lost on the Red Devils' new owner, Jim Ratcliffe, how the current Bayern boss can be difficult to work with.\n\nThat said, while reports suggest that INEOS are aware of Thomas Tuchel's history of falling out with club chiefs in previous roles, Ratcliffe has made his respect for the once Chelsea coach clear - as Christian Falk reported of mutual respect:\n\n\"Manchester United is still one of the top targets for Thomas Tuchel. He wants to return to the Premier League. He likes how things work there and what it means to be a coach there - it's very different to how things work in Germany,\" the BILD journalist wrote in his exclusive Fact Files column with CaughtOffside.\n\n\"The new owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, has a lot of respect for Thomas Tuchel, and Tuchel is still interested in the United job, so this could be a big topic if Erik ten Hag is sacked and as soon as Bayern Munich's involvement in the Champions League ends.\"\n\nRelated Jason Wilcox Not Impressed With Man Utd Defeat to Palace Manchester United's new Technical Director looked unhappy during the club's 4-0 defeat to Crystal Palace on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Ratcliffe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Ratcliffe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Evening_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Evening News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_League_First_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football League First Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Chilwell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Chilwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Stress", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Stress", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/mixcollage-29-jan-2024-11-20-am-9933.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548926", "eventUri": "eng-9548926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

As Bayern Munich departure looms, speculation grows.\n\nAs the footballing world braces itself for the inevitable summer shuffle of managerial appointments, one name has resurfaced in the Premier League rumor mill: Thomas Tuchel. The German tactician, currently at the helm of Bayern Munich, has dropped a hint suggesting a possible return to the Premier League, sparking speculation about his next destination.\n\nTuchel's tenure at Bayern Munich is nearing its end, with the manager set to depart after the season. While Bayern supporters have expressed their desire for him to stay, Tuchel has made it clear that he is looking for new challenges beyond the confines of Allianz Arena. Amid Manchester United's struggles under Erik ten Hag, Tuchel's name has emerged as a potential replacement, fueling the managerial speculation swirling around Old Trafford.\n\nIn a recent interview with TNT Sports, Tuchel addressed the speculation surrounding his future, hinting at his fondness for the Premier League: \"I'd rather not answer, but it is no secret that I loved it at Chelsea. I loved it in England and I loved it in the Premier League for sure, it was a very, very special time and I remember it very well.\"\n\nThe Likely Appointment at Manchester United\n\nDespite Bayern Munich's attempts to retain Tuchel's services, his likelihood of staying at the club seems slim. Tuchel acknowledged this, stating, \"It's very, very, very unlikely that it's at Bayern [next season], I have to say, because we have an agreement, there is at the moment no reason to doubt this agreement.\"\n\nTuchel's impending departure has left Bayern in a managerial quandary, with several high-profile candidates turning down the opportunity to succeed him. As Tuchel prepares to become a free agent this summer, Manchester United, amidst their underwhelming performances under Ten Hag, could emerge as an appealing destination for the accomplished manager.\n\nTuchel's track record, including his triumph in the Champions League with Chelsea, undoubtedly makes him an enticing prospect for the Red Devils. With the allure of managing in the Premier League again, Tuchel could be a significant consideration for United's hierarchy if Ten Hag faces the sack.\n\nThe potential appointment of Tuchel would represent a statement of intent from Manchester United, signaling their ambition to return to the summit of English and European football. Known for his tactical acumen and ability to galvanize squads, Tuchel could provide the spark needed to reignite United's title aspirations.\n\nHowever, amidst the managerial speculation, Tuchel remains focused on Bayern Munich's immediate objectives. With a crucial Champions League showdown against Real Madrid on the horizon, Tuchel's attention is firmly fixed on navigating his current side through the challenges ahead.\n\nAs the managerial carousel spins, all eyes are on Thomas Tuchel and Manchester United. Will the German maestro return to the Premier League, potentially filling the void at Old Trafford? Only time will tell as the footballing world eagerly awaits the next chapter in this unfolding saga.\n\nAmidst the managerial speculation, Tuchel's Bayern side faces a daunting task in overcoming Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals. With personal and professional stakes at play, Tuchel finds himself at the center of attention, with his decisions carrying significant ramifications for Bayern Munich and potential suitors like Manchester United.\n\nAs the footballing landscape evolves, the allure of the Premier League and the challenge of revitalizing a sleeping giant like Manchester United may prove irresistible to Thomas Tuchel. Whether he ultimately decides to leap remains to be seen. Still, one thing is certain: the prospect of Tuchel prowling the Old Trafford touchline is enough to set pulses racing among United faithful and neutrals alike.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fahad_hamid@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fahad Hamid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Thomas-Tuchel-teases-fans-on-potential-appointment.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548926", "eventUri": "eng-9548926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

their dominance of the Bundesliga has ended with Bayer Leverkusen winning the title this season.\n\nThat means Tuchel is leaving this summer but he does still have a chance to add to his legacy.\n\nTuchel takes his Bayern side into battle with Real Madrid on Wednesday night as a spot in the Champions League final is up for grabs.\n\nThe tie is finely-poised at 2-2 from the first leg and Tuchel could now reach a third Champions League final in the last five seasons.\n\nTuchel guided Paris Saint-Germain into the 2020 final and then repeated the trick with Chelsea in 2021.\n\nAfter losing that first final, Tuchel won it with Chelsea and now has a chance to go to a third Champions League final with a third different side.\n\nIneos will be watching the Real v Bayern clash with real interest and it may well be Tuchel's European pedigree which is making him so appealing.", "source": {"uri": "unitedinfocus.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "United In Focus"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olly_dawes@unitedinfocus.com", "name": "Olly Dawes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ineos", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ineos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_UEFA_Champions_League_final", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 UEFA Champions League final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauricio_Pochettino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mauricio Pochettino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn1.unitedinfocus.com/uploads/14/2023/05/GettyImages-1242262456-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548926", "eventUri": "eng-9548926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

'Because we have an agreement, there is at the moment no reason to doubt this agreement.\n\n'We took this position, the initiative came from the club, and so it is and I'm fine with it.\n\n'I don't need it for the extra percentage of competitiveness because I'm always up for a win, I'm always thinking how to improve the squad or how to improve myself in coaching.\n\nBayern Munich travel to Madrid on level footing with their European rivals on Wednesday night\n\nThe Champions League represents Tuchel's last chance for silverware (pictured with Real Madrid head coach Carlo Ancelotti)\n\n'We go all in.

They face Real Madrid in their Champions League semi-final second leg on Wednesday night, with the tie finely poised at 2-2 from the first leg in Bavaria.\n\nAhead of the match, Tuchel was asked about his future and reports linking him with the job at United.\n\nThe former Chelsea manager is among the favourites to replace under pressure manager Erik ten Hag, along with England boss Gareth Southgate, Brighton head coach Roberto De Zerbi and another former Blues manager Graham Potter.\n\nWhen asked about the Old Trafford links, Tuchel told TNT Sports: \"I'd rather not answer but it is no secret that I loved it at Chelsea.\n\n\"I loved it in England and I loved it in the Premier League for sure, it was a very, very special time and I remember it very well.\"\n\nHowever, Tuchel also refused to completely rule out remaining at Bayern.\n\nWhen asked where his next season would be, he added: \"It's very, very, very unlikely that it's at Bayern, I have to say, because we have an agreement, there is at the moment no reason to doubt this agreement. We took this position, the initiative came from the club, and so it is and I'm fine with it.\n\n\"I don't need it for the extra percentage of competitiveness because I'm always up for a win, I'm always thinking how to improve the squad or how to improve myself in coaching.\n\n\"We go all in. Does it have an influence on where I am next season? Maybe not, maybe I'm on holiday no matter what, let's see, let's see.\"\n\nTuchel also denied that Bayern's failure to win the Bundesliga title this season had made them \"hungrier\" for success in the Champions League.\n\n\"Unfortunately, it is our last chance to win a title but I don't think that makes us more hungry, this competition is a beautiful competition, it is the most beautiful, the most difficult,\" he added.\n\n\"Once you are in the semi-final and you arrive in the second leg you have a job, so the things are very clear, you are one step ahead.\n\n\"I think both teams go for it, all in. Both teams are focused. We have to be focused and fully switched on.

It has not worked out at Bayern Munich this season, but you only have to look at Carlo Ancelotti and Unai Emery to recognise how top coaches recover from setbacks.\"\n\nLiverpool.com says: Liverpool already looks as though it has its man in Arne Slot, but Tuchel was perhaps a name that should have been more in the running. He's had success at his previous clubs, including winning the Champions League with Chelsea, and he's had experience of following a highly influential manager, having taken over from Klopp at Mainz and Borussia Dortmund.\n\nThe fact that he's keen on a return to the Premier League might have made bringing him to Anfield a relatively simple task as well.

Bayern Munich head coach Thomas Tuchel is reportedly the favourite the replace Erik ten Hag as Manchester United manager this summer, but there are also said to be two other names on the club's shortlist.\n\nThe 20-time English champions have allegedly made the decision to sack Ten Hag once the 2023-24 campaign has concluded due to the team's struggles during the current season.\n\nAccording to inews, Tuchel, who is leaving Bayern this summer, is regarded as the favourite, with the German said to be open to the idea of taking charge of the Red Devils.\n\nHowever, the report claims that Sporting Lisbon's Ruben Amorim is also being considered, while Graham Potter remains an option for the club.\n\nAmorim, at one stage, appeared destined to move to Liverpool as Jurgen Klopp's replacement, but Arne Slot is now preparing to leave Feyenoord to take over the Merseyside giants.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nRuben Amorim, Graham Potter 'both in the frame'\n\nPotter, 48, has been without a managerial position since leaving Chelsea in April 2023, and he is said to he admired by Man United's new minority shareholder Sir Jim Ratcliffe and his team at INEOS.\n\nHowever, while Amorim and Potter are options, it is believed that Tuchel is firmly at the head of the queue.\n\nTuchel previously managed in England between January 2021 and September 2022, taking charge of 100 matches for Chelsea, boasting a record of 60 wins, 24 draws and 16 defeats.\n\nThe German won the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup during his time at Stamford Bridge before leaving in September 2022, and he was then appointed Bayern manager in March 2023.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nThomas Tuchel 'viewed as favourite to replace Erik ten Hag'\n\nThe 50-year-old won the Bundesliga title last season, but Bayer Leverkusen have been confirmed as German champions for the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nTuchel can still deliver the Champions League title to the Munich giants, though, with the team currently in Spain for the second leg of their semi-final with Real Madrid.\n\nBayern are believed to be interested in appointing Ten Hag as their new manager this summer, so the Dutchman and Tuchel could potentially swap clubs at the end of the campaign.\n\nMan United will finish their Premier League season with matches against Arsenal, Newcastle United and Brighton & Hove Albion, before facing Manchester City in the FA Cup final at the end of May.\n\nThere are also expected to be a number of player exits this summer, with Raphael Varane, Jonny Evans, Casemiro and Christian Eriksen allegedly likely to be the first four to depart.\n\nID:543123:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect5712:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"},

Tuchel made questionable substitutions that cost Bayern the game, raising doubts about his decision-making. Erik Ten Hag is experiencing a similarly dismal campaign at Old Trafford, with United's poor form and lack of silverware adding pressure on the Dutchman.\n\nThomas Tuchel has been one of the many names to be linked with the Manchester United job with Erik ten Hag's position at Old Trafford looking increasingly untenable by the day - but after some bizarre substitutions in Bayern Munich's Champions League semi-final loss vs Real Madrid, many have questioned whether he has blown his audition to become the Red Devils gaffer.\n\nIt has been well documented that the German is set to leave Bayern at the end of the season after ending their 12-year stronghold of the Bundesliga title, with Xabi Alonso embarking on an unbeaten season with Bayer Leverkusen to upset the apple cart and leave the Bavarian club high and dry in their search for continued success. That has been seen as a categoric failure by the Bayern board, and whilst Tuchel isn't confirmed as being set to leave, the late loss to Real Madrid will likely tip him towards the exit door.\n\nThe Germans had performed superbly throughout the tie and having gone 1-0 up on the night, they were mere minutes from going through before Joselu's late brace turned the game on its head to leave them stunned. But Tuchel's substitutions were bizarre and speaking to the Back Pages podcast, Martin Hardy of The Times has suggested that Tuchel may have blown his chance to become United boss thanks to his poor in-game management.\n\nHardy: Tuchel Subs a \"Sliding Doors Moment\" Bayern were on the back foot after some substitution blunders by Tuchel\n\nSpeaking after one of the most exciting Champions League nights in recent memory, Hardy couldn't believe Tuchel's decisions and claimed that it could be a sliding doors moment for his future managerial chances. He said:\n\n\"There's a chance this game is going to head to a penalty shootout, and you want the ice-cold penalty shootout king that is Harry Kane to be in and amongst them - and he took them both off.\n\n\"You thought, 'you've just given everything away here to a team that is noted for coming on late'. As it happens, I think we played what, 15 or 16 minutes of injury time.

The journalist says that Tuchel is keen to return to the Premier League when he leaves Bayern Munich this summer. Gareth Southgate has also emerged as a key contender to replace Erik ten Hag if he is sacked by INEOS.\n\nDespite Bayern Munich's inspired efforts in the Champions League this season, Thomas Tuchel is still expected to leave the Allianz Arena this summer and views the potentially vacant Manchester United job as a viable option as the German eyes a return to England, according to Fabrizio Romano.\n\nAlphonso Davies' stunning effort put Bayern in control at the Bernabeu on Wednesday night as the Bundesliga side took the lead in their Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid, but a magnificent late turnaround with two goals from substitute Joselu broke Bayern hearts as Madrid sealed their spot in the final for the 18th time.\n\nBayern's exit all but ends the club's disappointing season, having lost the league title to Bayer Leverkusen and crashed out of the German Cup to third-division side Saarbrucken. It was announced back in February that Tuchel - who Paul Ince labelled as \"elite\" - would step down as Bayern boss at the end of the season, something that has not changed since.\n\nEnglish clubs have reportedly begun to circle the decorated coach following the news of his availability, and football journalist Romano has given an update on the latest.\n\nTuchel 'Really Open' To England Return He led Chelsea to Champions League success during his time at the Blues\n\nFollowing Todd Boehly's Chelsea takeover, Tuchel was not given long before he was axed to make way for long-term target Graham Potter during a difficult spell for the club. At the time of his departure, Tuchel had one of the best win percentages ranked alongside Chelsea managers gone by and had also delivered the club's second Champions League title.\n\nHis departure felt somewhat premature and, according to Romano, the German feels he has unfinished business in the Premier League.\n\nIn his Daily Briefing on Thursday, Romano wrote:\n\n\"There is no change on Thomas Tuchel as he's expected to leave Bayern.\n\n\"We're seeing him linked with clubs in England, but again there's nothing concrete or advanced at this point.\n\n\"Still, for sure Tuchel would be more than happy to coach Man United even if they're without elite European football - he would be really open to returning to England in general, he loved it there. So, it depends on the clubs, but he would be really open to that possibility of managing again in the Premier League.\"\n\nGareth Southgate Also On Man United's List The England manager has emerged as one of the club's top targets\n\nThere is no guarantee that Erik ten Hag's time at the club is over, but his Old Trafford departure looks increasingly likely with United heading for their worst finish in Premier League history. It very much feels like Ten Hag has been on trial towards the end of the current season - and although he has led the club to back-to-back FA Cup finals and can still clinch silverware this year - overall, things have not gone well for the Dutchman.\n\nNew minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe seems determined for a fresh start, with a managerial change likely to be in the offing. As well as monitoring Tuchel's situation in Germany, the club have reportedly opened talks to appoint the current England manager ahead of the 2024/25 campaign.\n\nBut the news that Southgate could be

VAR, however, was not exactly the source of contention in the latter stages of the game. Instead, human error marred the massive match. The assistant official and match referee on the pitch both made mistakes in potentially disallowing an equalizing goal from Matthijs de Ligt.\n\nAfter the controversy, Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel fumed at the wrong decisions by the referees. The defeat means that the coach is now expected to depart the German club without a trophy. It was revealed back in February that Tuchel would leave the team after the current campaign. Despite the deep Champions League run, the situation is unlikely to change.\n\nTuchel's main problem was failing to lead Bayern to a Bundesliga title, which is unacceptable for the club's brass. Not only did his squad struggle on the pitch, but the coach also fell out with several players, as well as key executives at the team. The combination of these issues all directly led to his upcoming departure from Bavaria.\n\nTuchel is undoubtedly a quality coach. After all, he has collected significant silverware at all four clubs he has been at since 2015. This includes lifting the Champions League trophy with Chelsea in 2021 before Todd Boehly and company blew up the squad.\n\nDespite the success on the pitch, the German manager undoubtedly causes headaches practically everywhere he goes. Tuchel previously clashed with Borussia Dortmund's backroom staff, including chief scout Sven Mislintat in 2017. He then rejected a chance to sign with Bayern a year later to instead join Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nJust like his time with Dortmund, the coach once again had a fractured relationship with PSG's hierarchy. This was mostly due to Tuchel's public criticism of the club's transfer targets and policies. The issues then continued on to Chelsea as well. Although he lifted the European title, Tuchel unsurprisingly clashed with Blues brass throughout his time at the club.\n\nIt was even reported that Boehly labeled Tuchel a \"nightmare\" to handle before firing the coach in September of 2022. The German disagreed with Chelsea management regarding transfers and even had public spats with several first-team stars. This list included Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner, and Hakim Ziyech. All three players have since left the west London team.\n\nDespite his obvious issues, Tuchel will likely find a new job fairly quickly. If it was solely up to the German, he would make a return to the Premier League. The coach was asked about his future ahead of the match on Wednesday. While he initially attempted to avoid the question, Tuchel did admit his affinity for the English top flight.\n\n\"This is a tricky road where you lead me. I'd rather not answer,\" Tuchel told TNT Sports. \"But it is no secret that I loved it at Chelsea, I loved it in England, and I loved it in the Premier League for sure. It was a very, very special time in England and I remember it very well.\"\n\nOne team in particular that could very well soon target Tuchel is Manchester United. The club is currently experiencing their worst season in modern Premier League history under manager Erik ten Hag. As a result, club brass is expected to consider sacking the Dutchman following the current campaign.\n\nIf Ten Hag departs, Tuchel should be a favorite to land the prestigious position. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, United's new co-owner, must consider the pros and cons of dealing with a combative figure such as Tuchel. While he has shown a clear ability to win trophies, will the headaches be worth it? The British billionaire is almost surely already pondering this question.\n\nThe potential lack of a standout favorite for the job could work in Tuchel's favor. Whatever Ratcliffe and company decide, it seems as if changes, managerially and on the pitch, must happen at the club.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World

We took this position, the initiative came from the club, and so it is and I'm fine with it.\"\n\nWhen asked about rumours linking him back to England, the 50-year-old revealed his strong feelings for English football and the Premier League.\n\n\"I'd rather not answer but it is no secret that I loved it at Chelsea, I loved it in England and I loved it in the Premier League for sure, it was a very, very special time and I remember it very well.\"\n\nThese comments will only add fuel to the fire that the German wants to succeed Ten Hag and take over the reins at Old Trafford in the likely event INEOS pull the plug on the Dutchman's reign.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesperson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peoples Person | MUFC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_browne@thepeoplesperson.com", "name": "Alex Browne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Nou", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camp Nou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major_League_Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Major League Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.thepeoplesperson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/chelsea-v-liverpool-carabao-cup-final-min.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548926", "eventUri": "eng-9548926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The Red Devils currently lie in eighth position in the top flight and are facing an uphill battle to qualify for Europe, with games against Arsenal, Newcastle United and Brighton next on the agenda.\n\nUnsurprisingly, links to potential Ten Hag successors have intensified since the battering at Selhurst Park. A recent report covered by The Peoples Person relayed that Tuchel is a frontrunner to assume the hot seat once the campaign concludes.\n\nHe's on INEOS' list alongside the likes of Gareth Southgate, Ruben Amorim and Graham Potter.\n\nIt was previously stated that a section of United players would love to play for Tuchel and despite the top brass harbouring some concerns over his abrasive nature, his winning record and tactical acumen make him a standout candidate.\n\nAhead of Bayern Munich's second-leg Champions League semi-final clash against Real Madrid in Spain, Tuchel added fuel to the fire when he admitted he would be very open to making a return to England. He of course won the Champions League with Chelsea before he was sacked in controversial circumstances by new owner of the Blues Todd Boehly.\n\nAccording to talkSPORT's Anil Kandola (via GIVEMESPORT), United are indeed very interested in Tuchel and plan to accelerate talks with his camp as soon as this week.\n\nKandola explains, \"It's my understanding that contact between Manchester United and Thomas Tuchel will progress later this week, before Bayern's game against Wolfsburg.\"\n\n\"On a personal note, I'd be pleased to see Tuchel join United.\"\n\n\"A proven, no-nonsense winner. Would be good to see him at Old Trafford.\"\n\nThe reliable Ben Jacobs wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that Tuchel would welcome an approach from United if they decide to part ways with Ten Hag.\n\nTuchel believes he has \"unfinished business\" in the Premier League. He is also of the opinion that United's new sporting model would likely \"suit his style and personality.\"\n\nUnited return to action this Sunday when they host Arsenal at the Theatre of Dreams.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesperson.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peoples Person | MUFC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derick_kinoti@thepeoplesperson.com", "name": "Derick Kinoti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graham Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selhurst_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selhurst Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Boehly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Boehly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VfL_Wolfsburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "VfL Wolfsburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.thepeoplesperson.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/thomas-tuchel-fbl-eng-pr-norwich-chelsea-min.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548926", "eventUri": "eng-9548926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Now we will try to win the third title together. Let's try to make it happen,\" he added.\n\nThat seemed like Amorim committing his future to Sporting but iNews claim that those comments should be treated with caution.\n\nA Portuguese source allegedly believes that Amorim is trying to smooth over his relationship with angry Sporting fans after he travelled for talks with West Ham United.\n\nUnited moving for Amorim may be viewed as too big for him to turn down, but his comments allow for an extended stay if no offer arrives.\n\nAmorim has just clinched a second league title as Sporting boss and his reputation as one of the top young managers in the game is certainly exciting.\n\nThe 39-year-old seems to be behind Tuchel in the Ineos plans but is worth keeping an eye on, just in case he can actually be lured away from Sporting

He could still also get them to the Champion League final.\n\nTuchel, in my opinion, was prematurely sacked by Chelsea but that illustrated another problem that was nothing to do with his football.\n\nThere is no doubt that there have been difficulties in relationships with those above him at the clubs where he has coached.\n\nI think he would be a really interesting choice at Manchester United but co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe and the club's new structure would have to accept he may challenge them if he is not happy. Do they want that or do they want more stability, perhaps even sticking with Erik ten Hag?

The focus after the game was on Tuchel's decision to take off Harry Kane with Bayern narrowly leading 3-2 on aggregate, only to see Madrid score twice in quick succession at the death to reach the final.\n\nTuchel is leaving Bayern at the end of the season and is reportedly in the frame to replace Ten Hag as manager, and it has been claimed that contact has been made with the current incumbent seemingly certain to be sacked.\n\nRio Ferdinand spoke to Tuchel before the game, joking that he spoke to him about the United job. He told TNT Sports: \"I just said good luck to him, he's so relaxed and he's such a calm character.\n\nOn the topic of United, Ferdinand added: \"That was the final bit of the talk! Where are you going?! ... I think he's still got enough in the tank. No matter what happens today, he'll still have some big offers.\"\n\nAfter the game, however, pundits and United fans were less than impressed. Ex-Bayern and United midfielder Owen Hargreaves said: \"I'll tell you what was unexpected, Harry Kane going off the pitch. That's one of the biggest subs I've ever seen in a game of football of that magnitude.\n\n\"To take off a guy that's scored 44 goals, who is the most durable player pretty much anywhere ... You cannot take him off. There's five minutes left in the game, there's ten minutes of extra-time, 15 minutes. I said to Scholesy straight away, they're going to score.\n\n\"That's one of the biggest calls. I love Thomas Tuchel. I don't know why they made that call ... Bayern had it in their hands and they let it go. The mistake from Neuer obviously but everybody's going to be talking about the subs, you cannot take Harry Kane off.\"\n\nPaul Scholes added: \"I thought Tuchel's substitutions were strange. Kane was strange. Even if they get one goal, there's still extra-time, penalties to come as well, you know how strong he is.\"\n\nFellow onlookers and United fans were in agreement over what was quickly dubbed a \"disasterclass\" from Tuchel.\n\nJournalist Peter Hall joked: \"Understand Tuchel is now below Roy Keane and Phil Neville on Manchester United's managerial shortlist after those horrendous substitutions.\"\n\nA United fan added: \"Thomas Tuchel doing his best Manchester United 23/24 impression by conceding 2 in quick succession. \"This guy has passed the audition.\"\n\nAnother post read: \"I'd say Tuchel has passed the United audition perfectly. Hire him.\"\n\nMatthew Stranger added: Thomas Tuchel just passed his audition for the United job with flying colours.\"\n\nFinally, one post read: \"This was the perfect audition for Tuchel to Man United, he has all the qualities, bottling a lead, taking out effective players thinking he has won, this is elite TenHagBall.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Hargreaves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Owen Hargreaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scholes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Scholes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Keane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roy Keane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Neville"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/b8b071921a1a04ae39f098ff49c5f9dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548926", "eventUri": "eng-9548926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Did they ...\n\na) hurl verbal abuse his way for his decision to substitute Harry Kane five minutes from normal time? b) throw missiles at him for his failure to complete what has normally been the formality of Bayern winning a Bundesliga title? c) turn their backs on him after his team had somehow snatched defeat from the jaws of a victory that would have taken them to a Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund? d) sarcastically and gratefully wave goodbye to a manager whose time at the club has long been up? e) give him a rapturous ovation, bellow his name, salute him as a hero and love it when he returns their adulation?\n\nWell, it was not a), b), c) or d).\n\nOne-eyed English observers might pillory the Bayern manager for withdrawing Kane but that is probably a reflection on us more than it is on Tuchel. On the list of things that cost Bayern a place in the Champions League final, Kane being hooked comes somewhere near the bottom.\n\nManuel Neuer's mistake comes out on top, the officials' cock-up when Matthijs de Ligt thought he had scored a 103rd minute equaliser comes a close second. But Kane being replaced? Really?\n\nThe England captain had done ok but that is about it. He got the assist for Alphonso Davies' goal but it is fair to say the Canadian had a fair bit to do after Kane's pass had reached him.\n\nWere you impressed by Tuchel despite Bayern's defeat? Have your say in the comments section\n\nHarry Kane was substituted with Bayern leading 1-0\n\nNo, Bayern followers will not buy into the idea that their side's demise in Madrid was the result of Tuchel's shortcomings. And the sort of relationship Tuchel can enjoy with a fanbase, his charisma, his personality, is why he WOULD be a suitable Manchester United manager.\n\nIn the Bernabeu, Tuchel did not fail an audition for the United job, assuming, of course, it becomes available. He took a relatively limited Bayern squad to within a Neuer cock-up of the final of the Champions League, a competition he has already won.\n\nOn that journey, he disposed of an English team that might still win the Premier League. After a controversial loss, he had the right blend of indignation at a decision that went against Bayern, and dignity in defeat. He represented an iconic club well. There would be many concerns for United fans if Tuchel was to replace Erik ten Hag.\n\nFor a start, how much input - or, to give it the proper name, interference - would Tuchel stomach from Sir Jim, Sir Dave and the rest of the new football operations crew? Also, what does it say about a manager when he is looking for his fifth big job in nine years?\n\nYes, there are reasons why Tuchel might not be a good fit if the new United football operations crew did decide to dispense with Erik ten Hag. But subbing off Harry Kane is not one of them ... and there are more reasons why he would be a good fit.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

There are whispers they have something up their sleeve for next season but so far their search for a new manager points to a club that has lost their way.\n\nThere have been enquiries over Erik ten Hag, although he is set to lead United to the FA Cup at the end of the domestic season, while Julen Lopetegui has also been on their radar but he is down the line with West Ham United as they move swiftly to replace David Moyes at the end of the campaign.\n\nRalf Rangnick also spoke to Bayern but decided to stick with the Austria national team, and was moved to make a statement confirming as such. \"I want to clearly stress that this is not a rejection of Bayern Munich but rather a decision for my team and our common goals,\" the former United interim manager said. Continuing the Old Trafford theme, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was reported by Sky Germany to be an interim option for Bayern.\n\nXabi Alonso was a target but decided to stay at Leverkusen after taking the title off Bayern, which could mark an end to the best of the Bundesliga being picked off by the Bavarians. That trend goes back to Michael Ballack through to Robert Lewandowski and today's squad including Serge Gnabry plus others.\n\nZinedine Zidane masterminding three consecutive Champions League trophies at Real Madrid means he inevitably gets linked to the biggest jobs, while a role of this magnitude has raised the possibility of going back to managers who know the job already: Hansi Flick or Julian Nagelsmann. The latter has since committed his future to the German national team. There has even been a petition from fans for Tuchel to stay.\n\n\"FC Bayern decided to dismiss Thomas Tuchel in the summer after the defeat against VFL Bochum. What an atrocious decision!\" read the opening statement of the petition, signed by 12,000 fans. Tuchel, however, was unmoved. \"Even though this topic is good for me when they [the fans] wish you to stay, it's not something that is a priority,\" he said.\n\n\"It isn't allowed to be a priority. Whether it's pleasant or unpleasant, I don't allow myself to be influenced by it.\"\n\nFor whoever they eventually appoint, Bayern can appear the impossible job at times. Being flat-track bullies of the Bundesliga seems to be the minimum requirement, with honorary president Uli Hoeness causing a storm earlier this season when he insisted Tuchel did not improve players. Tuchel said he was deeply offended by the comments.\n\n\"He doesn't think he can improve a [Alphonso] Davies, [Aleksandar] Pavlovic or [Jamal] Musiala. If it doesn't work, you should buy someone else. I think you should work hard on them and give them confidence\" said Hoeness.\n\nBayern have face the great Carlo Ancelotti in the Champions League semi-final second leg, which is a reminder of what they had immediately after Guardiola left. Ancelotti was sacked in 2017 as \"the performance of our team since the start of the season did not meet the expectations we put on them,\" according to chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge.\n\nHis career since suggests Bayern have not been getting it right when it comes to appointing and keeping their managers.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

No other English club is the focus of quite so much attention and the media landscape is dominated by United, in part because of the high number of successful Old Trafford greats who now do punditry or co-commentary,\n\nUntil this season Bayern had won every Bundesliga title since 2013 but despite their dominance the noise around the club is unrelenting. Bayern's list of grandees inside the club and the number of legends passing comment on the outside makes it a demanding place to work, as Thomas Tuchel has found out, winding down his days in Bavaria by engaging in a war of words with honourary president Uli Hoeness.\n\nALSO READ: How United exile Sancho celebrated as dressing room footage emerges\n\nALSO READ: Ten Hag's argument about United's biggest weakness has been exposed\n\nIn Manchester, Erik ten Hag has been stung by the criticism of late, biting back at pundits after the 1-1 draw with Burnley when he reminded some former players that they went through a rebuilding phase during the Sir Alex Ferguson era as well. Tuchel could yet deliver the perfect response to his own snipers by guiding Bayern to the Champions League final and Ten Hag will hope the FA Cup final offers him some respite.\n\nBayern's European campaign started in the Allianz Arena against United in September with a thrilling 4-3 win, a scoreline that would become familiar to Ten Hag's team this season. It was the day before that game that feels particularly illuminating now, however.\n\nAnyone who has been in a Tuchel press conference will be aware of what an exceptional communicator he can be. It is an environment in which he is far more comfortable than Ten Hag and at a time when the first signs of pressure were starting to grow around the Dutchman, it was his opposite number who so eloquently outlined the challenge that comes with managing a club like United.\n\n\"I felt with Manchester United there was always a lot of noise, a lot of pundits are ex-players from Manchester United, you have this legacy from Sir Alex Ferguson which creates a lot of pressure, a lot of expectation around Manchester United,\" said Tuchel.\n\n\"It tells you you work at a big club, big expectation, big success. All of us here in Bayern and my colleagues at Manchester United want to achieve the same things. I would not say it's an advantage for us, it's common that little things become bigger than at other clubs or the talking about it is noisy. I think within, I can only assume they coach in an environment where players grow and reach their top level. That's what we're trying to do - instill rules and a winning culture.\n\n\"It's evident to see if I watch Manchester United play. The results maybe don't speak the same language but the team is full of quality and the club has a winning culture.\"\n\nTen Hag would almost certainly agree with that and it is an answer that suggests Tuchel knows exactly what it takes to manage United. He has experienced similar in Munich and having managed Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea as well, his CV contains plenty of elite clubs with significant noise around them.\n\nAny concerns at United would focus on the German's combustible character. His time at those clubs has often seen him fall out with senior management and with Ineos looking to build a collaborative football structure, Tuchel would clearly be a gamble.\n\nAt Borussia Dortmund, PSG, Chelsea and Bayern Munich he has never stayed at a club for more than 127 matches (PSG). His time at Bayern will end after just 15 months and just over 60 games in charge. That doesn't suggest longevity and if things go awry he could easily fall out with senior figures at United and those pundits he identified as creating noise around the club.\n\nBut if Ineos do opt for change in the dugout this summer, of all the candidates mentioned Tuchel has the most glittering CV and the relevant experience of managing a club of this size. He proved that back in September.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyrone_marshall@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Tyrone Marshall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uli_Hoene\u00df", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uli Hoene\u00df"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Trafford", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Trafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bavaria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bavaria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_ten_Hag", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik ten Hag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnley_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burnley F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Korfball/Clubs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article29130498.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1695372301.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548926", "eventUri": "eng-9548926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The Italian manager has been one of Tuchel's most frequent opponents. He has faced only five coaches more than the Real Madrid boss.\n\nTuchel holds a favourable record against his fellow former Chelsea manager; four wins, three draws and three defeats.\n\nRead More Thomas Tuchel 'is on Man United's shortlist' if Sir Jim Ratcliffe decides to replace Erik ten Hag - with the German set to leave Bayern Munich in the summer despite fan protests\n\nThe German boss' points-per-game of 1.50 is impressive considering the number of times he has gone up against Ancelotti. By comparison, Tuchel has managed only three wins against both Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola in 19 and 12 attempts respectively.\n\nOne of the most outstanding achievements of his career to date is his perfect record in semi-finals. Tuchel has reached the final four in seven different competitions during his career with Borussia Dortmund, PSG and Chelsea and he is yet to fail to advance to the final.\n\nIn fact, the 50-year-old has not experienced defeat in those 11 semi-final matches. But as Tuchel found out in 2022, when his Chelsea side were inexplicably beaten 3-1 in the quarter-final second-leg of the competition the Spanish capital - and as Ancelotti so confidently told reporters - 'this is Real Madrid.'\n\nTo a lesser extent, 'this is Ancelotti.' The Italian reached another milestone in the competition this season, becoming the first boss to manage 200 games. That figure is more than a 100 more than Klopp, more than 50 more than Jose Mourinho and 12 clear of Sir Alex Ferguson.\n\nThe former AC Milan and Juventus midfielder has won 114 of those encounters, another record. His side are also unbeaten in their 11 matches in the Champions League this season, winning eight and drawing three.\n\nTuchel suffered a Champions League quarter-final exit while Chelsea manager at the hands of Ancelotti and Madrid in 2022\n\nThe Italian boss went on to lift the trophy for a record fourth time after a 1-0 victory over Liverpool\n\nTuchel become a Champions League winner with Chelsea in 2021. His side beat Zinedine Zidane's Madrid in the semi-final\n\nBernabeu factor\n\nAncelotti admitted that Bayern were the better team in the first-leg but Madrid's knack of grinding out results provided the latest example of their Michael Myers-like ability in the competition. They cannot be killed.\n\n'We have this squad,' Ancelotti continued in his Tuesday press conference. 'I'm confident in the fans who will help us.\n\n'We think we've got it better, but Tuchel will think he does too.\n\n'These are similar clubs, they have great history and a lot of success in the Champions League. We respect them. They did better than us in the first leg.'\n\nAncelotti's reference to the Bernabeu crowd is an important one. Most famously showcased during their unbelievable run to the aforementioned 2022 final, crazy things happen on Champions League nights in the home of the Spanish giants.\n\nWhat is more worrying for Bayern is that Madrid may not need a crazy night when routine will do. Los Blancos are unbeaten at home in all competitions this season. They have failed to win only four of 22 matches on home soil.\n\nBayern are without a win in their last two away games in the Champions League.\n\nMadrid clinched the LaLiga title last weekend and maintained their incredible home record with a 3-0 victory over Cadiz\n\nBayern suffered yet another defeat in the Bundesliga when they were bested by Stuttgart on Saturday\n\nKey players\n\nLast week in Germany, Vinicius Jr was the star man for the 14-time winners, scoring a brace which ensured the visitors head into this week's clash as favourites. The Brazilian has now been involved in 31 Champions League goals since the start of Madrid's triumphant 2021-22 campaign.\n\nHis second goal drew him level with Jude Bellingham as the club's top scorer this season before the Englishman pulled ahead with an effort in Madrid's 3-0 win over Cadiz on Saturday.\n\nBellingham and Vinicius are each enjoying remarkable campaigns, with the duo directly involved in 64 goals this season; 32 apiece. Fellow frontman Rodrygo's numbers aren't too shabby either.\n\nRead More Bayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel reveals unlikely secret to Harry Kane's incredible goalscoring success in Germany as he challenges the striker to thrive against Real Madrid in Champions League semi-final\n\nHe has notched 17 goals in all competitions, including five in the Champions League, and registered nine assists. The trio will be key for Ancelotti on Wednesday, as will the returning the Dani Carvajal who was suspended for the first-leg.\n\nThe Madrid boss confirmed that Andriy Lunin will continue in goal despite Thibaut Courtois returning from injury and keeping a clean sheet as Madrid clinched their LaLiga title.\n\n'The plan for a player coming back from injury does not change because of one game,' said Ancelotti. 'Courtois is doing well but he needs time to get back to his best self -- he had an ideal game.'\n\nAs Ancelotti's defensive injury woes clear, Tuchel has been faced with an untimely spate. Bayern's weekend defeat by Stuttgart came with the added price of a serious ending ankle injury to Raphael Guerreiro and a knock to Eric Dier, which has made him doubtful for the game.\n\nThough, at least Matthijs de Ligt is close to full fitness for the visitors and would be a welcome inclusion in their squad.\n\nBayern's two goals last week came in a short blitz, first Leroy Sane powered a drive past Lunin before Kane kept his cool from the spot. The England skipper appears to be on a personal mission to end jokes of his empty trophy cabinet.\n\nNone can accuse him of not pulling his weight. Whether the likes of Sane, Serge Gnabry and Jamal Musiala can perform will likely determine the outcome of the game.\n\nTuchel revealed that he told his players to embrace their 'inner child' ahead of the mouth-watering clash and he admitted the tie will likely be decided by the finest of margins.\n\nThomas Tuchel revealed that he told his players to embrace their 'inner child' on Wednesday night\n\nDefender Matthijs de Ligt (left) is nearing full fitness, while in-form Jamal Musiala was a constant pest for Madrid's defence in the first leg\n\nRight back Dani Carvajal is set to return to the staring XI after missing last week's clash due to suspension\n\n'It is important to connect with your own inner child.' He told reporters on Tuesday. 'When we were little we played these games in the garden.\n\n'So now we are here and that's our chance to make it true. I think both teams have to endure defending and suffering when their opponents have the ball.\n\n'It is extremely difficult to steal the ball from Real Madrid.

Despite talk of a \"mutual decision\" Tuchel at the time said he would have preferred to stay in the role.\n\nWhile Tuchel's stock has since risen after taking Bayern to within minutes of a Champions League final, several candidates have already knocked back a chance to replace him as coach.\n\nAlonso, one-time mentor Julian Nagelsmann and former Manchester United boss Ralf Rangnick have all reportedly declined Bayern's interest.\n\nThe last-minute elimination, headlined by referee frustrations and an uncharacteristic error by captain and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, means a first trophyless season since 2012.\n\nA season without silverware is always an unthinkable outcome in Munich. But with Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final and Leverkusen on course for a treble, Bayern have plenty to ponder.\n\nSpeaking at a gala dinner at a gourmet Madrid restaurant hours after the elimination, Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen spoke to players and club officials, including Tuchel and honourary president Uli Hoeness.\n\nDreesen acknowledged the \"very painful defeat\" but said the 2025 Champions League \"home final is our big goal now!\"\n\nThe former banker's speech, intended to cut through the disappointment in the room, was greeted with sporadic applause.\n\nHoeness, who has officially stepped down from club duties but remains Bayern's principal powerbroker, criticised Tuchel just a fortnight ago for his inability to develop junior players.\n\n\"He doesn't think you can improve (Alphonso) Davies, (Aleksander) Pavlovic or (Jamal) Musiala.\n\n\"He thinks if it doesn't work, you should just buy another one. I think you should work with them and give them confidence.\"\n\nThat all three played a starring role on Wednesday -- with Davies scoring Bayern's only goal and Munich local Pavlovic anchoring defensive midfield -- only serves to highlight Hoeness' misguided criticism.\n\nTuchel said Hoeness had \"hurt his honour as a coach\" but for Bayern the statements not only eroded any chance of holding onto Tuchel, but turned potential other targets away from the role.\n\nTuchel had previously left the door ajar to staying at Bayern beyond the season, but said on Wednesday night \"it's no secret that I loved my time in the Premier League with Chelsea and in England.\"\n\nBayern sporting director Max Eberl, in the job since March, faces several challenges on the pitch.\n\nAlonso's decision to knock back Bayern as well as reported interest from Liverpool and Real means Leverkusen will again be a real threat next season.\n\nDortmund may be fifth in the league this season but could go into the next campaign as Champions League winners.\n\nSeveral of Bayern's biggest stars, including Leon Goretzka, Kingsley Coman and Serge Gnabry, are under performing, with their output not matching their weighty pay packets.\n\nDefenders Dayot Upamecano and Min-jae Kim, who cost a combined 92.5 million euros ($100 million), have largely ridden the bench in recent months, with Tottenham outcast Eric Dier preferred to partner Matthijs de Ligt at centre-back.\n\nThe club's better performers are also on the wrong side of 30. Neuer, who impressed despite his mistake, is 38 and Thomas Mueller turns 35 this year.\n\nHarry Kane, undoubtedly Bayern's star this season with 44 goals in 45 games, will turn 31 in summer.",

Failure to do so would then significantly ramp up the pressure on Pochettino.\n\nLinks to Tuchel are unlikely to die down this summer as the 50-year-old considers his next step in the game. Commenting publicly on what he expects to happen this summer regarding his future, Tuchel remarked: \"It's very, very, very unlikely that it's at Bayern, I have to say, because we have an agreement, there is at the moment no reason to doubt this agreement. We took this position, the initiative came from the club, and so it is and I'm fine with it.\n\n\"I don't need it for the extra percentage of competitiveness because I'm always up for a win, I'm always thinking how to improve the squad or how to improve myself in coaching.

You need to ask the club, whether the club wants me to keep going or not.\n\n\"If I have one more year on my contract here and no one says anything, then I suppose that I am going to be here.

Despite talk of a \"mutual decision\" Tuchel at the time said he would have preferred to stay in the role.\n\nWhile Tuchel's stock has since risen after taking Bayern to within minutes of a Champions League final, several candidates have already knocked back a chance to replace him as coach.\n\nAlonso, one-time mentor Julian Nagelsmann and former Manchester United boss Ralf Rangnick have all reportedly declined Bayern's interest.\n\nThe last-minute elimination, headlined by referee frustrations and an uncharacteristic error by captain and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, means a first trophyless season since 2012.\n\nA season without silverware is always an unthinkable outcome in Munich. But with Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final and Leverkusen on course for a treble, Bayern have plenty to ponder.\n\n'A very painful defeat'\n\nSpeaking at a gala dinner at a gourmet Madrid restaurant hours after the elimination, Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen spoke to players and club officials, including Tuchel and honourary president Uli Hoeness.\n\nDreesen acknowledged the \"very painful defeat\" but said the 2025 Champions League \"home final is our big goal now!\"\n\nThe former banker's speech, intended to cut through the disappointment in the room, was greeted with sporadic applause.\n\nHoeness, who has officially stepped down from club duties but remains Bayern's principal powerbroker, criticised Tuchel just a fortnight ago for his inability to develop junior players.\n\n\"He doesn't think you can improve (Alphonso) Davies, (Aleksander) Pavlovic or (Jamal) Musiala.\n\n\"He thinks if it doesn't work, you should just buy another one. I think you should work with them and give them confidence.\"\n\nThat all three played a starring role on Wednesday -- with Davies scoring Bayern's only goal and Munich local Pavlovic anchoring defensive midfield -- only serves to highlight Hoeness' misguided criticism.\n\n'I loved my time in England'\n\nTuchel said Hoeness had \"hurt his honour as a coach\" but for Bayern the statements not only eroded any chance of holding onto Tuchel, but turned potential other targets away from the role.\n\nTuchel had previously left the door ajar to staying at Bayern beyond the season, but said on Wednesday night \"it's no secret that I loved my time in the Premier League with Chelsea and in England.\"\n\nBayern sporting director Max Eberl, in the job since March, faces several challenges on the pitch.\n\nAlonso's decision to knock back Bayern as well as reported interest from Liverpool and Real means Leverkusen will again be a real threat next season.\n\nDortmund may be fifth in the league this season but could go into the next campaign as Champions League winners.\n\nSeveral of Bayern's biggest stars, including Leon Goretzka, Kingsley Coman and Serge Gnabry, are under performing, with their output not matching their weighty pay packets.\n\nDefenders Dayot Upamecano and Min-jae Kim, who cost a combined 92.5 million euros ($100 million), have largely ridden the bench in recent months, with Tottenham outcast Eric Dier preferred to partner Matthijs de Ligt at centre-back.\n\nThe club's better performers are also on the wrong side of 30. Neuer, who impressed despite his mistake, is 38 and Thomas Mueller turns 35 this year.\n\nHarry Kane, undoubtedly Bayern's star this season with 44 goals in 45 games, will turn 31 in summer.\n\nThe combined challenges means Bayern, trophyless and without a manager, face the biggest challenge to their hegemony in a generation.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Despite talk of a \"mutual decision\" Tuchel at the time said he would have preferred to stay in the role.\n\nWhile Tuchel's stock has since risen after taking Bayern to within minutes of a Champions League final, several candidates have already knocked back a chance to replace him as coach.\n\nAlonso, one-time mentor Julian Nagelsmann and former Manchester United boss Ralf Rangnick have all reportedly declined Bayern's interest.\n\nThe last-minute elimination, headlined by referee frustrations and an uncharacteristic error by captain and goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, means a first trophyless season since 2012.\n\nA season without silverware is always an unthinkable outcome in Munich. But with Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final and Leverkusen on course for a treble, Bayern have plenty to ponder.\n\nSpeaking at a gala dinner at a gourmet Madrid restaurant hours after the elimination, Bayern CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen spoke to players and club officials, including Tuchel and honourary president Uli Hoeness.\n\nDreesen acknowledged the \"very painful defeat\" but said the 2025 Champions League \"home final is our big goal now!\"\n\nThe former banker's speech, intended to cut through the disappointment in the room, was greeted with sporadic applause.\n\nHoeness, who has officially stepped down from club duties but remains Bayern's principal powerbroker, criticised Tuchel just a fortnight ago for his inability to develop junior players.\n\n\"He doesn't think you can improve (Alphonso) Davies, (Aleksander) Pavlovic or (Jamal) Musiala.\n\n\"He thinks if it doesn't work, you should just buy another one. I think you should work with them and give them confidence.\"\n\nThat all three played a starring role on Wednesday -- with Davies scoring Bayern's only goal and Munich local Pavlovic anchoring defensive midfield -- only serves to highlight Hoeness' misguided criticism.\n\nTuchel said Hoeness had \"hurt his honour as a coach\" but for Bayern the statements not only eroded any chance of holding onto Tuchel, but turned potential other targets away from the role.\n\nTuchel had previously left the door ajar to staying at Bayern beyond the season, but said on Wednesday night \"It's no secret that I loved my time in the Premier League with Chelsea in England.\"\n\nBayern sporting director Max Eberl, in the job since March, faces several challenges on the pitch\n\nAlonso's decision to knock back Bayern as well as reported interest from Liverpool and Real means Leverkusen will again be a real threat next season.\n\nDortmund may be fifth in the league this season but could go into the next campaign as Champions League winners.\n\nSeveral of Bayern's biggest stars, including Leon Goretzka, Kingsley Coman and Serge Gnabry, are under performing, with their output not matching their weighty pay packets.\n\nDefenders Dayot Upamecano and Min-jae Kim, who cost a combined 92.5 million euros ($100 million), have largely ridden the bench in recent months, with Tottenham outcast Eric Dier preferred to partner Matthijs de Ligt at centre-back.\n\nThe club's better performers are also on the wrong side of 30. Neuer, who impressed despite his mistake, is 38 and Thomas Mueller turns 35 this year.\n\nHarry Kane, undoubtedly Bayern's star this season with 44 goals in 45 games, will turn 31 in summer.\n\nThe combined challenges means Bayern, trophyless and without a manager, face the biggest challenge to their hegemony in a generation.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news",

replacement for Thomas Tuchel, with the German set to leave Allianz Arena at the end of the 2023-24 campaign.\n\nA recent report claimed that Ten Hag was in the frame to replace Tuchel, with the Dutchman said to be admired by a number of senior figures at the German club.\n\nHowever, according to German journalist Christian Falk, Ten Hag is no longer viewed as a candidate to become Bayern's next manager.\n\nFalk claims that discussions had taken place with Bayern's director of sport Max Eberl, but the talks will not progress any further, with the European giants deciding against a move for the 54-year-old.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nBayern 'no longer interested in appointing Erik ten Hag'\n\nTen Hag was in charge of Bayern's second team between 2013 and 2015, and a return to the club was seemingly a possibility this summer, with his future at Manchester United uncertain.\n\nThe Dutchman is expected to remain in charge of the 20-time English champions for their final four matches of the campaign against Arsenal, Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and Manchester City.\n\nHowever, it has been claimed that Ten Hag will be sacked after the FA Cup final on May 25.\n\nBayern have also been linked with Brighton head coach Roberto De Zerbi, but the German outfit have allegedly decided against paying the \u00a312m release clause in his contract.\n\nXabi Alonso had also been viewed as a leading target, but the Spaniard has agreed to remain in charge of Bayer Leverkusen for at least one more season.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nHansi Flick 'seen as favourite to replace Thomas Tuchel'\n\nHansi Flick is now regarded as the favourite to replace Tuchel at the helm this summer, with the German expected to take charge of Bayern for the second time.\n\nThe 59-year-old previously managed the Bundesliga giants between 2019 and 2021, winning seven trophies in total, including two league titles, one German Cup and the Champions League.\n\nFlick has been without a job since leaving Germany last year, and he had been linked with the Barcelona job before it was confirmed that Xavi would be remaining as head coach.\n\nZinedine Zidane is also an outsider for the position, with the Frenchman, who has been without a position since leaving Real Madrid in 2021, believed to be keen to return to management.\n\nID:543152:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop

Despite the infamous \"FC Hollywood\" moniker, the job on S\u00e4bener Stra\u00dfe used to be one coaches would jump at.\n\nThis, however, is no longer the case. With the season slowly but surely drawing to a conclusion and the Munich outfit still desperately scrambling to convince someone to replace Tuchel, it begs the question: why does nobody want to manage Bayern?\n\nOne of the simplest reasons why Bayern are struggling to find a new coach is quite simply because of their high standards. The Bavarians demand a lot from their managers and only want someone who is proven at a high level - or at least someone who has shown that he can coach a team to play attractive football.\n\nThis, naturally, massively narrows down the possible options and makes finding the right man a huge challenge. If you are successful as a coach, chances are you are under contract somewhere.\n\nIndeed, most of Bayern's top options in this ongoing search have been people who are already employed. Priority target Xabi Alonso has a Bayer Leverkusen contract until 2026, just like Austria boss Ralf Rangnick and Germany coach Julian Nagelsmann, all of whom have rejected the Bavarians in favour of continuing their current projects.\n\nRoberto de Zerbi at Brighton and Unai Emery at Aston Villa, two more coaches greatly admired by club chiefs Max Eberl and Christoph Freund, are also under contract and so is Erik ten Hag, who has recently been touted as a potential option, having previously coached Bayern's reserves under Guardiola.\n\nThough Ten Hag likely won't survive beyond this season at Man Utd, the Dutchman is fully focused on trying to save his job and won't entertain any talks right now. Bayern, however, are desperate to sort out their coaching problem before the end of the campaign.\n\nFC Hollywood\n\nAnother reason why everyone is seemingly rejecting Bayern is the fact that the job has become unattractive. While the \"FC Hollywood\" nickname has been in place for three decades, things have recently been taken to a worrying new level after a brief period of relative stability.\n\nThough the regime at Bayern is a new one, the sacking of Julian Nagelsmann by Oliver Kahn and Hasan Salihamidzic last year is still fresh in the minds of coaches, not least of the man himself, which is one of the reasons why he snubbed them.\n\nNagelsmann, one of Europe's brightest up-and-coming tacticians, had been hired to lead the project for the next decade but was unceremoniously fired after Bayern slipped below Dortmund in the Bundesliga title race despite the fact that his side looked set to go deep in the Champions League.\n\nThe fact that Bayern were prepared to pull the trigger on Nagelsmann after less than two years in charge sent a message - and not a good one. It showed that no matter how highly regarded you are, you have next to no job security. The Tuchel situation also illustrates this.\n\nTuchel hasn't officially been sacked but it is clear that he has been pushed out of the club. Kicking Tuchel out is certainly not unwarranted given domestic results this season, but it is strange after backing him more than perhaps any other manager of theirs has been backed in recent seasons.\n\nBayern shattered their own and the Bundesliga's transfer record to sign Harry Kane for \u20ac100 million. They also spent an additional \u20ac50m on Kim Min-jae and signed one of Tuchel's favourite players in Raphael Guerreiro, one of his former Dortmund signings. To then cut ties with him six months into his first full season in charge seems another ill-judged decision.\n\nBayern job not attractive anymore\n\nDue to the rise of the Premier League, the job at Bayern is no longer one of the absolute best-paid gigs in football. A promising coach can head to pretty much any Premier League side and earn about as much as they could in Munich and chances are they would be under less scrutiny too.\n\nBayern are under intense media pressure, but it's not only the media that likes to talk about the Bavarians. Honorary president Uli Hoene\u00df also feels inclined to frequently give his thoughts on current affairs and this is rarely a good thing.\n\nHis recent comments publically slamming Tuchel ahead of the crucial Champions League fixtures against Real Madrid were another PR disaster for Bayern. Why would someone like Unai Emery, Ralf Rangnick or Roberto de Zerbi, adored in their current roles, trade exciting projects for this?\n\nREAD MORE: Exclusive - Xabi Alonso 'has everything' to be world's best manager\n\nThe same can be said for Xabi Alonso. Bayer Leverkusen are one of the Bundesliga's most affluent sides even if they can't quite match Bayern's revenues. Alonso has been backed in the market, he is loved by everyone - even neutrals - and probably earns a competitive salary. It is unsurprising that he would rather stay at Bayer than go to Bayern.\n\nIn many ways, Bayern have been the architects of their own downfall. Ill-advised, knee-jerk decisions, constant drama and the fact that sides like Leverkusen and mid-table Premier League clubs are catching up with them all make the job in Munich an unattractive one.",

Maybe he wanted height for corners, I don't know.\n\n\"You cannot take him off. There's five minutes left in the game, there's ten minutes of extra-time, 15 minutes. I said to Scholesy straight away, they're going to score.\n\n\"That's one of the biggest calls. I love Thomas Tuchel. I don't know why they made that call. Kim came on ten minutes before that and they were quite comfy.\n\n\"They went from a back four to a back three. Bayern had it in their hands and they let it go. The mistake from Neuer obviously but everybody's going to be talking about the subs, you cannot take Harry Kane off.\"\n\nUnited legend Scholes then added: \"It ended up a game of substitutions. Good ones for Real Madrid. Joselu with the two goals, brilliant. Wins his team the game. Neuer makes a huge mistake which he'll be disappointed with.\n\n\"I thought Tuchel's substitutions were strange. Kane was strange. Even if they get one goal, there's still extra-time, penalties to come as well, you know how strong he is.\n\n\"Kim was the stranger one. I thought they looked quite comfortable in the game up until that point. They go to three at the back. Kim coming off last week was a disaster for him and again he looked a little bit all over the place.\"\n\nAnd, amid the recent speculation linking him with Old Trafford, it did not take long for fans to start sticking the boot in online.\n\nOne joked: \"Thomas Tuchel doing his best Manchester United 23/24 impression by conceding 2 in quick succession.\n\n\"This guy has passed the audition.\"\n\nAlong with a laughing emoji, another post read: \"Manchester united fans watching This Tuchel disaster class & there are linked to him.\"\n\nA third commented: \"Tuchel has completely thrown away that game with his poor subs.\n\n\"Quite typical for Utd fans to get gassed in the moment and lose the plot. He is far from what this club needs moving forward.\"\n\nWhile a fourth added: \"Tuchel taking off Kane and Musiala only to lose his lead within minutes is so banter-ish that he can only be heading to

He's exactly what United don't need\n\nThomas Tuchel's emergence as a candidate under consideration by Manchester United is so Manchester United. So old Manchester United. Remember that club, without a compass, unmoored, uncentred, repeatedly attaching itself to the next guru off the rank?\n\nThe belief that the answer to the myriad problems at Old Trafford lies in the genius of one man was the very idea Sir Jim Ratcliffe's revolution was supposed to lay to rest. The future is predicated, he told us, upon a model based on a clear vision of what the club wants to be, a style of play, a structure to support that, and a leadership group, including the coach, aligned to deliver it. This is not a coach-led orientation, but a top-down vision in which the manager is just one cog in the machine.\n\nThe reports seeping out of Old Trafford paint a dispiriting picture of disintegrating trust. Whatever influence Erik ten Hag exerted in his first season at United is no longer his to wield. He has lost his voice in a dressing room deaf to his entreaties. He remains in his post, it would seem, because the alternative is worse.\n\nWith only three league games left, there is insufficient time to patch together the broken parts in time to affect a transformation that would give United any chance of securing some kind of European representation next season, let alone beating Manchester City in the FA Cup final. At least with Ten Hag still in his post there is a reason for the players to unite, if only to rally against him.\n\nIt is in this withered context that Tuchel's name appears in the list of replacements, carried forth mostly by association. Tuchel has occupied some powerful posts, the two biggest clubs in Germany, Borussia Dortmund and, for a few more days at least, Bayern Munich, Qatari bauble Paris Saint-Germain and American investment vehicle Chelsea.\n\nHe has forged a reputation as a first-rate technician, but one with a low threshold for political interference from above, one not slow to challenge reluctant players or those softened by excess. If the latter has been one of Ten Hag's issues then how is Tuchel an upgrade? As control has been lost at Old Trafford, Ten Hag has taken aim at the press and former players in the media space, echoing Tuchel's experience at every one of his former clubs.\n\nAt Dortmund, Tuchel was at war with chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke. The final straw was Tuchel's response to the reluctance of some players to take the field against Monaco a day after the team bus was attacked by an explosive device en route to the Westfalenstadion. Watzke sympathised with players who thought a 24-hour postponement was insufficient, and was incredulous at reports that some players, disappointed at having to play so soon, left Tuchel's office in tears the morning after they attack.\n\nAt PSG Tuchel was at odds with sporting director Leonardo over the club's approach to recruitment, which could be interpreted only as criticism of the galactico policy favoured by the Qatari ownership. Only one winner there. At Chelsea he was fired by owner Todd Boehly, who claimed they had different visions for the club. This after he had won the Champions League five months after replacing Frank Lampard.\n\nIn his first months at Stamford Bridge the greater need was Chelsea's. The club gave him carte blanche to impose discipline and method on a squad that had lost its way. The transformation was immediate and ultimately led to victory over Manchester City in the Champions League final. Whilst this underlined his qualities as a coach, it also demonstrated the volatile nature of cup competitions that often reward disruptors in a way league competitions do not.\n\nHe could not be blamed for Russia's attack on Ukraine that ultimately did for the club's former Russian owner Roman Abramovich. Nevertheless, an unwillingness to bend, or to adapt to a rapidly shifting power-dynamic are not selling points for an organisation undergoing the kind of radical transformation experienced at United.\n\nTo win the league a degree of harmony is required. Tuchel does not do harmony, unless he is the author of it. Though he remains in his role at the Allianz Arena until the end of the season, Tuchel was formally binned by Bayern Munich in February, just 11 months after his shot-gun move to replace the sacked Julian Nagelsmann.\n\nThe problems were familiar. A failure to connect with established figures in the squad, who did not buy into a style thought too cautious, and a fractious relationship with influenial figures on the board, particularly former players,Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, proved insurmountable.\n\nuchel might justifiably claim that, Harry Kane apart, the club did not bring in the players he had identified during the summer. However, taking on the hierarchy is hardly a virtue that commends him to New Trafford, an institution seeking alignment across the whole management structure.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk",

Plus, thoughts on Tottenham and VAR.\n\nTommy T for Man Utd? No thanks\n\nIs Thomas Tuchel any good? Is he a successful manager? Is he what Man United may need?\n\nA look at his resume would shout yes. He is considered one of the finer coaches of the modern era, known for his tactical nous. Three league titles, one Champions League victory, 1 CL final loss and 7 other career cup wins, as well as a UEFA coach of the year award all signal to a premier manager.\n\nBut on closer inspection, there always seems to be something wrong. Hired by a certain Ralf Rangnick as a youth coach at Stuttgart, he won the U19 Bundesliga, before leaving after a personality clash - something that would become a running theme. He then took over Augsburg II, and coached a certain player-come-coach in Julian Nagelsmann. This then brought him to Mainz, where he would secure a mid-table finish, and then into Europe the following year. After the next season went poorly, he asked to resign.\n\nHis next leap was to replace the unknown Jurgen Klopp at Dortmund. He would finish second in his first year, and win a cup in his second, before leaving three days later having a strained relationship with the board, being described as a \"difficult person\".\n\nHis success there caught the eyes of PSG, with whom he would go on to win his first league title. He would also lose the final 3 league games of the season, and be defeated on penalties vs Rennes in the cup final. His following season went much better; achieving a domestic treble, and a loss in the CL final to Bayern, 1-0. He would last until December later that year before being fired - again - with his attitude in question - again. With Director Leanardo stating \"Tuchel [must] respect the people above [him]\", and labelled the comments as damaging for the club.\n\nThis then brought him to Chelsea the following January. In Roberto Di Matteo style, he would take them to the CL final, and win 1-0 vs Man City. He also met them a few days prior, in the FA Cup final, but were defeated 1-0. He then won the UEFA Super Cup, and World Club Cup final the next season, before going on to lose the LC final to LFC, and then later losing the FA Cup final to the same side 3 months later.\n\nUnder new ownership, Tuchel went on to spend a record 250M that coming summer following Roman's removal. He would then be sacked - again - that coming September. Boehly reportedly described Tuchel as a \"nightmare\" to deal with on recruitment to a Premier League executive. Tuchel had also fallen out with and isolated several first team players.\n\nForever falling successfully forwards, he would land the head coach role at Bayern Munich in March the following year - replacing a familiar Julian Nagelsmann. He would fortunately win the league title due to Dortmund failing to win on the final day of the season. They then heavily invested in his signings(100M Harry Kane), and were one game from yet another CL final. In the league however, they have been atrocious. Currently 15 points behind the league leader & Champions Leverkusen. This, their first title loss in 11 years. Very surprisingly, the leadership at Bayern informed him he will be gone at the end of the season - in mid-season - and despite few options to replace him, he is not considered to stay on.\n\nYet again, his attitude towards players is questioned, as were his pragmatic style of play. His relationship with the directors was poor, and transfer issues remain once more. He himself admitted he is \"not the only problem\".\n\nSo would this work for Man United? I reckon absolutely not. He seems like the German Jose Mourinho. Pragmatic, difficult, a constant complainer, yet, with pedigree in winning trophies and reaching finals. A man who wants transfer control, yet ignores his many duds (95M Lukaku). At United, his style of play would eventually be criticized, players would be ostracized, and he would leave under another very familiar cloud of disrespect. The media would be all over him the minute things did not work out, and he has thus far shown he couldn't handle this. Yes, he may win a trophy, but it would take massive investment and patience, and almost certainly end in no more than 3 years.\n\nSo, no thanks Thomas Tuchel. If the United board were wise, they would agree with the same. It would be another short term move, one that will end almost the same as Jose's did, but most likely with less silverware, but just as much misery. Once that's been branded, it's off to Roma to loan in Lukaku.\n\nCalvino (Has there ever been a manager to fall forward so successfully? He's like the Choupo-Moting of managers.)\n\nMORE ON MAN UTD'S MANAGER SEARCH FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Tuchel still favourite for Man Utd job after inevitable Ten Hag sack despite CL cock-up\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Exclusive: Meulensteen expects Man Utd to sack Ten Hag as he picks 'two reasons' to sell players\n\n...So, bring on a defender of dubious quality to see out the last 10 minutes of a game that was already going to plan, substitute your most creative and dangerous players in the last couple of minutes and promptly concede twice when it is too late to do anything about it.\n\nRight out of the Erik Ten Hag playbook, that one.\n\nAlphonso Davies definitely passed his audition, but I'm not sure that Tommy did ...\n\nET King (MUFC)\n\nSack the players, not the manager\n\nAs a Man United Fan, It has been an awful season for fans watching us losing matches at home to all teams like it is business As USUAL. Haven't these players any pride or sense of belonging?. Where do they get the gall to insubordinate the Manager? In the corporate sector for people who earn much less that these players, performance appraisals are aligned to output. Period. NOT who likes you!!!!\n\nWhy pay a salary to a man who has \"0\" output or commitment like Rashford or Martial? Why are we so desperate to suffer fools for these players?\n\nAs for sacking Ten Hag, I think that will be the most stupid decision United will make. We change managers like underwear YET the players remain behind to earn their top weekly wages even when they deliver -0.\n\nI believe these players need to be read the riot act and that their pay must be aligned with their work ethic & output. As for now, they are operating on weekly blank cheques at the expense of the club.\n\nJohn Gitonga\n\nBlaming the Glazers\n\nHello to all you reactionary reds on here, I thought I would write in with my thoughts on what is going on at United. I'm not sure if anyone watched the Jim Ratcliffe program where he did a sort of undercover boss thing at OT?\n\nWell he basically went around seeing what an absolute shit show we currently are, food left all over the place, people not knowing what to do, stuff just left to rot etc, what I'm getting at is that this all rests squarely on the Glazers heads, they don't care about United one bit, they don't care that everything is collapsing because they are still syphoning off millions from the club.\n\nNow if you are at work and your boss doesn't give a flying f*ck about anything why should you bust a gut for them, the same can be said for the players at United, they see the Glazers not giving a shit about anything as long as they get their pound of flesh and they think, why should I bust a gut every week on the pitch if they don't care?\n\nIt all starts at the top and until will get those parasites out then nothing will change and players like Rashford, Sancho, Anthony etc will carry on thinking they can just turn up take the money and bugger off because that's exactly what their bosses do. The sooner Ratcliffe takes full control the better.\n\nPaul Murphy, Manchester\n\nA sensible mail from across Manchester\n\nJust some thoughts from a long-term local City fan on the Manchester United issue.\n\nManchester United are one of the biggest clubs in the world, incredibly well funded and a glamorous team to play for. They have the ability to pay top whack and top wages to secure some of the best talents in the world. They are a danger to our ongoing success in the medium and long term.\n\nThe only time that United have worried me as challengers in the post Ferguson era was under Mourinho. Mourinho quickly identified the various squad and social issues at the club, and ultimately the board decided to go with the players rather than the manager - players that they later sold for the exact issues that Mourinho identified.\n\nI am not one of those fans who enjoys the schadenfreude aspect of their local rivals being rubbish. Firstly, it's better for the economy in my\n\narea if United are playing high profile matches and bringing in tourists. Having Manchester become the home of two (or even several) top clubs challenging for top honours would be good for Manchester as a whole as is the investment that people like Shiekh Mansour brought to the area and Radcliffe seems to be planning around Old Trafford.\n\nMore importantly though, seeing your mates and family members depressed and frustrated and hopeless about such an important aspect of their life isn't really fun after the initial \"bantz\".\n\nWhen City were midtable as I grew up or in the mid to late 90s were bouncing around, football wasn't particularly fun because United used to beat us twice a year and we were so far apart. Where's the fun in beating a clearly inferior side?\n\nBoth sets of fans used to reminisce of the 60s/70s where City had Lee, Bell, Summerbee et al and United had Best, Law, Charlton because we used to go toe to toe with champagne football (and then in the case of Best and Summerbee, champagne piss ups together too!). 2011/12 season confirmed how much more satisfying this was with a last minute winner in the league to snatch the title away from United. It's much more fun as a City fan to see the best United team possible, with all their power and glory, and then still beat them. No excuses or anywhere to hide there like they have now.\n\nDue to this, I'd like ETH to go. I don't believe he has the pedigree or the talent to build a truly competitive squad or the in game management decisions against the elite coaches. He came in with a philosophy of play that he has consistently abandoned and he has had numerous discipline issues within the squad that later became public, often from people not known for discipline issues in their career. I think he's a good coach but not a great one.\n\nPerhaps I'm a nostalgic boomer but when I think of Manchester United, I think of clubs such as Real Madrid. They are an English equivalent and their standards should be similar. No matter how bad the ownership, the squad issues, or any other presence, I don't accept that 2 cup finals and an ECL finish is \"decent enough\" for ETH to keep his job at that club.\n\nHe would be hounded out at Real Madrid or Bayern Munich or Juventus or any of the super elite clubs. I'm not sure why Manchester United are different? How can they accept these falls in standards?\n\nRemembering a one-off 40 year old decision around Ferguson and Mark Robins while ignoring the other thousands of times that managers have been kept on for future promise seems foolish. Or to spin that same logic around, is the presumption that given the same length of time at United as Ferguson, then ETH would achieve the same or similar? Because if not then the \"keep him because Fergie needed time\" doesn't work as an argument.\n\nIn my own career, I've always tried to live by the philosophy that you can't sack people for making a mistake or two mistakes or ten mistakes. You sack them because you believe that they make mistakes in the future and those mistakes will cost you money or reputation.\n\nEvery year Manchester United are not in the Champions League knockout stages is a year where somebody is costing them both money and reputation. There is a new executive team in place who seem like talented people given their CV. Not quite sure if there's too many cooks in that United kitchen now between the Glazers, INEOS, Berrada, Ashworth and the rest but if they can decide properly who is in charge then they've got a good chance.\n\nI don't see how ETH can fit into this. The talk around him is toxic and he has to share blame for the failures along with any others.\n\nThe question always falls to \"if not ETH then who?\". This seems like a poor question. There are numerous managers out there who would love to work for Manchester United and all share a similar philosophy of play that ETH abandoned so could use that part of the squad effectively without the baggage of ETH.\n\nChange seems the only reasonable option. Even with an FA Cup win, it would be wasting another season and papering over the cracks.\n\nPaul, Manchester\n\nTottenham need players who don't sh*t the bed\n\nTottenham's season, which is far from defined as of yet, has been a bit of a sh*t sandwich.\n\nThe common word is that we started far better than anyone could have expected, players, coaches, board and certainly the fans. Did this start, and the good will around the club alter expectations? I think it certainly played into the trap of 'what if's' but no right-minded person had any thoughts at that time of anything other than pressing for top four, which, in essence, is exactly what happened.\n\nThe fact that we've benefitted from other clubs being batshit mental for much of the season shouldn't detract from the fact that Spurs weren't remotely considered for top five - and we really ought to be doing enough in two of our final three matches to make that certain (f*** beating City!). So the season should be considered a success.\n\nThe frustration comes from knowing that much of the negative felt self-imposed. A tweak to tactics in the final few minutes away at Wolves makes it nine wins from twelve but instead turned into two defeats on the spin. But every team has these. Ours just feel frustratingly frequent.\n\nNow is the time (yawn, again) when Levy and his scouting department have to give Ange the goods. I can't be arsed to name all the players who should/could leave, there are many, or those I'd like to see join - mostly because I don't know enough of European football anymore (that said, domestically, Eze is a joyful player but Palace could well do good things next season) but I will say that we've got the nucleus of a good team which needs supplementing with some players who aren't wimps, and don't sh*t the bed when the opposition decide to have a go.\n\nI wrote in a while back saying similar but that we'll probably finish seventh, I don't think that is possible anymore, or is highly unlikely, so thank you United and, despite the upturn, Chelsea for making us look way more competent that we have been.\n\nDan Mallerman\n\nREAD: Angeball can only succeed if Spurs go all in this summer - but has Postecoglou done enough?\n\nSlots of reasons to be optimistic\n\nHas anyone used the phrase \"The Slot Machine\" yet?\n\nIf not can I claim it here?\n\nIt's pretty much what I'm basing my optimism for the next few years on at Liverpool.\n\nThat and Arne sounds like Arnie (The Terminator) can I claim that one too?\n\nDon't flag and support VAR\n\nCan every fan, player, pundit, and commentator that's ever complained about delayed offside flags and disingenuously brought up how \"one of these days someone's gonna get injured\" kindly shut the f**k up, now? People CLEARLY care more about game-changing goals, and rightly so.\n\nI've supported delayed flags since VAR has been a thing and so should everybody else. By the way, I didn't want Bayern to progress, so this isn't coming from a team bias perspective. Annoyingly, I still see immediate flags get whistled in the Premier League when the replay shows it was the wrong decision, or at the very least the linesman was guessing.\n\nOh, and just let me say, last night showed precisely why VAR IS a good thing for the game. But, please, let's have more mails and opinion pieces on why it's the tools and not the workman who is ruining the game. Kmt.\n\nSimon, Norf London Gooner", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Next year, we come back,\" the official said and added: \"We will do all to come back this time too and reach the final that in 2025 takes place in our arena in Munich.\"\n\nFollowing a title-less season like in 2012 Bayern in 2024 finds itself in the same situation. After the 2012 setback, the 2013 victory in the German final against the BVB followed aside from 11 consecutive national title wins.\n\nIn the dark hours in Madrid, Bayern gathered licking their wounds but reminded of the clubs' claim to always come back. Like in 2012, deep analysis is to follow coming along with transfer actions; not to speak of having to find a new coach.\n\nReports speak of former German national and former Bayern coach Hansi Flick as the newest target.\n\nBayern is facing a fundamental squad change after a poor season aside from the need to clarify its leaderboard's areas of competence.\n\nThe painful exit in Madrid was only the tip of the iceberg of a season full of difficulties.\n\nThe Polish top referee Szymon Marciniak admitted his and his assistant's fatal mistake in extra time when calling for off-side without checking the situation.\n\nInstead of a possible 2-2 equalizer, the Spanish giant continued its impressive journey into the 2024 final on June 1 at Wembley against Borussia Dortmund.\n\nBayern coach Thomas Tuchel spoke of \"a clear violation of the rules.\" Board member sports, Max Eberl, reported about Marciniak's apology aside from several players such as Matthijs de Ligt and Thomas Muller.\n\nTuchel said: \"We accept that apology as fair sportsmen, but at a level like this the game must be continued and checked after the situation is finished.\"\n\nBayern at first must solve its coaching problem after a curious series of call-offs from several-eyed candidates. As Tuchel is departing after this season, it's on Eberl, sporting director Christoph Freund and the new coach to take care of that.\n\nDrawing the right conclusions about a failed season is the Bavarians' most pressing issue, despite the disappointment the side took back on its shoulders on its way back from Madrid to Munich. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan-Christian_Dreesen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jan-Christian Dreesen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_M\u00fcller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas M\u00fcller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansi_Flick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hansi Flick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymon_Marciniak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Szymon Marciniak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Eberl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Eberl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bavaria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bavaria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548926", "eventUri": "eng-9548926", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 13}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1670, "textEnd": 1676}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

The front four all said they had to go.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_lipton@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Martin Lipton",

The SWPL Cup winners are through to the SWF Scottish Cup final have the opportunity to lift every major honour this term. This result damaged their prospects of doing so.\n\nThe war of words between opposition managers Potter and Sadiku in the build-up to the encounter added a little bit of extra spice to proceedings.\n\nThe former had complained about the amount of time it had taken Celtic to do their pre-match huddle in their cup semi-final last month and claimed her girls had showed their superior fitness towards the end of that tie. The latter, not surprisingly, took a dim view of those remarks.\n\nNo quarter was given by either side on the field once referee Stewart Luke got proceedings underway. But this was an Old Firm derby which was distinctly lacking in the bile and bitterness of its male equivalent.\n\nA bumper crowd turned up at a fixture which was being screened live by Sky Sports. Fans wearing blue mixed with supporters decked out in green and white in the stands without a hint of trouble. Together, they generated a party, not a toxic, atmosphere. No sectarian songs were given an airing.\n\nRangers' followers were far happier than their Celtic counterparts with what they witnessed during the opening 45 minutes. The home team dominated the early exchanges and the visitors struggled to get out of their own half.\n\nDefender Eilidh Austin struck the crossbar with a powerful shot from fully 30 yards out and striker Kirsty Howat also forced a save from goalkeeper Kelsey Daugherty with another long-range attempt.\n\nBut it was Celtic who had the best scoring opportunity of the first-half against the run of play after Murphy Agnew chipped over the heads of the Rangers defence and sent Natasha Flint through on goal. Her team mate fired just wide of the right post.\n\nThat chance seemed to rouse Kelly Clark and her team mates to life. They started the second-half far more brightly and Victoria Esson did well to hold a deflected Flint attempt.\n\nEsson then tipped a goal-bound Flint effort after the striker had been supplied in the opposition area by Lucy Ashworth-Clifford.\n\nPotter threw on Kathy Hill and Brogan Hay for Austin and Rowe respectively in a bid to get her side back into the game.\n\nShe made a triple substitution in the closing stages - Sarah Ewens replaced Rio Hardy, Rachel McLaughlan took over from Tessel Middag and Jane Ross allowed Howat to go off. McAulay struck the crossbar at the end of regulation time.\n\nBut it was not to be Rangers' day and it was the Celtic players and supporters who celebrated at the end of the 90 minutes.\n\nCeltic have to play Partick Thistle, Hearts and Hibernian while Rangers still have to face defending champions Glasgow City away as well as Hibs and Thistle. There is still a lot of football to be played by both teams before anything is decided.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rangers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PFA_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PFA Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Women's_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Women's Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Rowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Rowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jo Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby_della_Madonnina", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Derby della Madonnina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Govan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Govan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Govan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natasha_Flint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natasha Flint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sectarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sectarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Community_Shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FA Community Shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelsey_Daugherty", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kelsey Daugherty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirsty_Howat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirsty Howat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Esson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victoria Esson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brogan_Hay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brogan Hay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessel_Middag", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tessel Middag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Ross_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jane Ross (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicky_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicky Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partick_Thistle_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Partick Thistle F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Midlothian_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heart of Midlothian F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernian_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hibernian F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Shinty", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Shinty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18048701/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544141", "eventUri": "eng-9544141", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

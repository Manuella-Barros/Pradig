But the goal didn't count because the referee blew the whistle for the offside without letting the play be completed.\n\n\"The linesman said to me, 'I'm sorry, I made a mistake,'\" De Ligt said after the 2-1 loss in which Madrid's stoppage-time winner by Joselu came after a VAR intervention that overturned an initial offside call. In that occasion, though, the other linesman allowed the play to continue.\n\n\"The rule says that if it's not clear offside ... you have to keep playing.\" De Ligt said. \"And if you go in the last minute and you whistle like this, I think this is a big mistake. If it's offside or not, I don't know, VAR can check it, but if you don't check it, how can you see it? This is a shame.\"\n\nThe VAR also came into play in the 71st to disallow a Madrid goal because of a foul by defender Nacho Fern\u00e1ndez on Joshua Kimmich. Joselu had equalized in the 88th after a blunder by goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.\n\nThe victory sent Madrid into a final against Borussia Dortmund on June 1 in London.\n\nMadrid coach Carlo Ancelotti said his defenders stopped after the whistle was blown before the De Ligt goal.\n\n\"The last play is clear, the referee blows the whistle and we stop,\" he said. \"This referee is very good, he refereed in a World Cup final. They complain about this and we complain about the goal by Nacho that was disallowed. Kimmich threw himself to the ground.\"\n\nThe match referee was Szymon Marciniak, who officiated the 2022 World Cup final between Argentina and France in Qatar.\n\nBayern coach Thomas Tuchel said it was a \"disastrous decision from the linesman and from the referee.\"\n\n\"It feels almost like a betrayal in the end because of that decision,\" he said. \"The linesman said sorry. That does not help.\n\n\"To raise the flag in a decision like this, in a close decision in the last minute, and the referee as well... The referee does not have to whistle,\" Tuchel added. \"He sees that we win the second ball, he sees that we get the shot away. To whistle is a very very bad decision.

The assistant referee flagged for offside in the buildup to rule out the goal, and while replays appeared to show the decision was incorrect, it was not reviewed by VAR.\n\nThe Sporting News explains exactly what happened and why the goal was chalked off, and not reviewed by the offside technology.\n\nMORE: When is the Champions League final between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund?\n\nWith Real Madrid up 2-1 and the match deep into nine minutes of stoppage time, Bayern Munich threw everything forward hoping for a last-gasp equaliser to send the match to extra-time.\n\nA ball from deep was delivered by Bayern Munich towards the top of the penalty area, where Noussair Mazraoui battled for the ball with a defender. With the ball bobbling around, Bayern substitute Thomas Muller pounced, nodding it laterally to defender Matthijs de Ligt who was playing up as a striker as a desperation play from manager Thomas Tuchel.\n\nUSA: Watch the controversial disallowed goal by Matthijs de Ligt with analysis from broadcaster CBS\n\nDe Ligt managed to turn his defender and get on the ball, and rifled a shot past a confused Andriy Lunin who stood still almost as if he had stopped playing. That's because he had indeed stopped playing, because the whistle had blown prior to De Ligt's shot.\n\nThe official had blown his whistle, reacting to the assistant referee who had raised his flag for an offside offence on Mazraoui in the buildup. However, replays in the immediate aftermath showed that Mazraoui was quite tight with Real Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger, and may have actually been onside -- De Ligt was leaning just off, but he did not receive the ball from deep, Mazraoui did, and he was just behind Rudiger.\n\nNo worry, we have semi-automated offside technology to correct the decision, which came into play earlier in the match, seeing a Vinicius Jr goal count after initially being disallowed. Except, it wasn't...why?\n\nMORE: Recap the thrilling Champions League semifinal between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich\n\nWith the incident happening at the very end of the match between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, broadcasters didn't have ample time to inform fans about what happened, and thus viewers will have been left confused about why the Matthijs de Ligt goal wasn't given after being initially ruled out for offside.\n\nIn fact, the incident wasn't even reviewed by VAR, because technically, it never happened. Because the referee blew his whistle before the end of the play, the shot cannot be reviewed by VAR as he stopped play before the shot occurred. That is why Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin was standing still as De Ligt put the ball in the net, because he had reacted to the whistle.\n\nThus, the play was not reviewable by VAR. Ever since the introduction of VAR, assistant referees have been instructed to leave their flag down for an extra few beats to allow play to continue, such that if their decision is incorrect, they do not stop a promising attack with the wrong call.\n\nHowever, that instruction was not heeded here by either the assistant referee or the head official. Instead, the AR raised his flag immediately, and the head official blew his whistle in response, ending play early. While the decision would normally have been reviewable had the official not stopped play early, because he blew the play dead, it could not be reviewed.\n\nIt was a sharp departure from a refereeing mantra that has been in place for years, ever since VAR was introduced. While television broadcasters repeatedly complain about officials letting play continue, in their mind, too long before blowing dead for offside, this exact situation is what they are hoping to prevent by doing so.\n\nMORE: Who will win the 2024 Champions League final? Experts make their early predictions and picks\n\nThe all-Polish officiating crew for Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich at the Bernabeu was headlined by lead official Szymon Marciniak, who is one of the most experienced referees in not just Europe, but in the world.\n\nMarciniak is the two-time defending winner of the \"World's Best Referee\" award by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the organisation which is held largely responsible for keeping global football's official records and other historical markers.\n\nThanks to his nearly immaculate reputation, Marciniak has been handed two of football officiating's most prestigious assignments. He was the official for the 2023 Champions League final between Manchester City and Inter Milan, and he officiated the 2022 FIFA World Cup final between Argentina and France.\n\nAll this to say that Szymon Marciniak is as experienced as they come, but still committed a grave error. While Polish assistant Tomasz Listkiewicz raised his flag early, that does not stop play on its own. Even if the flag goes up, is down to Marciniak to allow play to continue or blow his whistle, and in this situation he made the clearly incorrect decision.\n\nBayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel was understandably beside himself at the end of the match, feeling that his club was robbed of a spot in the Champions League final.\n\nBoth Tuchel and Matthijs de Ligt confirmed that the assistant referee personally admitted his mistake and apologised to both, but that was not enough to calm the fuming Bayern boss.\n\n\"The assistant referee apologised to me,\" Tuchel said, before claiming, \"what happened is a disaster and I cannot accept it.\"\n\nDe Ligt echoed that sentiment, saying, ''It is a shame, the assistant referee told me he made a mistake.''", "source": {"uri":

Bayern Munich were beaten 2-1 after a late Joselu brace saved the 14-time winners following Alphonso Davies' stunning opener. Thomas Tuchel was left frustrated by the linesman's error, which prevented his side the opportunity to equalise in the dying moments.\n\nMatthijs de Ligt has claimed the linesman admitted to making a mistake in the final moments of Bayern Munich's 2-1 Champions League semi-final defeat against Real Madrid. The two sides were level after an entertaining 2-2 draw in Germany in the first leg.\n\nThe visitors even took a shock lead in the second-half after surviving Los Blancos' onslaught as Alphonso Davies tore down the left flank before cutting inside and firing a rocket into the far corner of the net with his weaker right foot. The Canadian has been linked with a move to the Bernabeu in the summer transfer window, but he stunned the home crowd with the wonderful goal, which looked to have secured a place in the final.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Real Madrid haven't been defeated in a European final in over 40 years, with Aberdeen being the last side to beat the Spaniards in 1983.\n\nHowever, as is often the case with Real Madrid in European competition, there would be a twist in the tale. Newcastle United and Stoke City flop, Joselu, was the unlikely hero as the Spanish forward netted a brace in the 88th and 91st minutes of the game to knock Thomas Tuchel's side out.\n\nRelated Real Madrid 2-1 Bayern Munich: Player Ratings and Match Highlights The side from Spain enjoyed a late double from Joselu to book a spot in the Champions League final once again.\n\nA controversial late decision by the linesman saw the flag raised and the whistle blown just seconds before Bayern Munich put the ball in the net for a second time. VAR is often relied upon to make tight offside calls, but on this occasion, the assistant referee took matters into his own hands. View the controversial moment below:\n\nDe Ligt Claims the Linesman Apologised The defender had the ball in the net\n\nReplays showed that the player in question looked to be in an onside position and, due to how fine the margins were, the decision likely should have been left up to the semi-automated offside technology to ensure accuracy.\n\nOne man that was disappointed with the decision to stop play from unfolding was De Ligt. The Dutch defender was the man who eventually put the ball in the back of the net, only to be denied by the linesman's flag. De Ligt cut a frustrated figure as he explained his version of events to beIN Sports:\n\n\"I think we made rules in football, and the rules say if it's not a clear offside - which it wasn't - you have to keep playing. If you whistle like this in the last minute, I think this is a big mistake.\"\n\nDe Ligt also went on to say: \"The linesman said to me 'I'm sorry, I made a mistake.' I'm not the type of person to blame the loss on the referee so Madrid deserve to win because they won 2-1. But I think if it's a rule, it's a rule.\" View the clip below:\n\nThomas Tuchel Rues Linesman's Error The departing manager also claimed an apology was issued\n\nTuchel, who will leave Bayern Munich at the end of the 2023/24 season, was left disgruntled by the decision to not allow play to carry on, branding it: \"Disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee. It felt almost like a betrayal in the end.\"\n\nThe German had little time for any explanation that may be given for the incident as he also said in his post-match interview with TNT Sports: \"It was against the rules. It was a really really bad decision.\" View the Bayern Munich manager's comments:\n\nRelated 10 favourites to replace Thomas Tuchel at Bayern Munich The former Chelsea boss has confirmed that he will leave the Bundesliga giants at the end of the season.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberdeen_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aberdeen F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stoke City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeIN_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BeIN Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-08-may-2024-10-52-pm-9374-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

AP\n\nLate on in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, the German giants went for the equaliser. Just moments before, Joselu had turned the tie upside down with two goals in three minutes with Real Madrid leading the second leg 2-1 and 4-3 on aggregate .\n\nDesperate for an equaliser of their own and to force extra time, and maybe penalties, Bayern committed bodies forward. Joshua Kimmich put in a long pass which was headed centrally by Thomas Mueller for defender Matthijs de Ligt to score in the 12th minute of stoppage time.\n\nThe goal was ruled out for offside after the linesman had raised his flag earlier in the move before the ball went in the net, thus ruling out a VAR review.\n\nAn animated Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel protested down the sideline following the decision. After the match, he told broadcaster DAZN the decision was \"a disaster, an absolute disaster\".\n\n\"We have to let the action play out until the end. That's the rule, especially since it's so close to the goal, and it's so limited.\n\n\"The first error is made by the linesman, the second comes from the referee,\" Tuchel said.\n\nThe 50-year-old coach told broadcaster TNT the decision \"felt like a betrayal\".\n\nSpeaking at the press conference, Tuchel said the referee apologised but added: \"It doesn't help to say sorry.\n\n\"Everyone has to go to their limit, everyone has to suffer, everyone has to play without making mistakes. So the referee has to be at that level too.\n\n\"It just doesn't help to make excuses after the fact.\n\n\"You are on the field for this reason, because you are the best there is. And we have the right to expect that until the end.\"\n\nDe Ligt, who had the goal disallowed, agreed with his manager, calling the decision decisive.\n\n\"The rule says that if it's not clear offside &mldr; you have to keep playing.\u00e2\u20ac De Ligt said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And if you go in the last minute and you whistle like this, I think this is a big mistake.

Replays show the decision was the incorrect one, with Bayern denied the opportunity to progress in extra-time. Bayern manager Thomas Tuchel was fuming after the match, branding the decision \"disastrous\".\n\nReal Madrid showed why they are the kings of the Champions League again on Wednesday night as they produced a stunning late comeback against Bayern Munich to reach another final. A brace from former Stoke forward Joselu turned the game on its head after Alphonso Davies' earlier goal.\n\nMadrid's victory was not without controversy, though, after Bayern were denied an injury-time equaliser by the linesman's flag. Matthijs de Ligt thought he had made it 2-2 when he swept the ball home from Thomas Muller's header but the referee had already blown his whistle for an offside against the former Ajax defender.\n\nDe Ligt, though, was not involved in that stage of the build-up play and should not have been flagged offside. Instead, it was De Ligt's teammate Noussair Mazrouai who challenged for the ball, and footage from beIN SPORTS appears to show that Mazrouai himself was not offside.\n\nVideo Clears Up Offside Debate Mazrouai was onside\n\nThe incident was a huge talking point on the night, with post-match reaction dominated by the disallowed goal rather than Joselu's remarkable brace. De Ligt himself revealed after the match that the linesman responsible for the error had apologised to him.\n\n\"If it's offside, it's offside,\" De Ligt told beIN SPORTS. \"But I think we made rules in football and the rules are that if it's not a clear offside - which it wasn't because I don't see it yet, if it's offside or not - you have to keep playing.\n\n\"If you go in the last minutes and you whistle like this, I think it's a big mistake. If it's offside or not you can check it, but if you don't check it, how can you see it? The second goal (for Madrid), Rudiger is almost offside. If he whistles, OK, but now there's a difference and this is a shame.\n\n\"The linesman said to me, 'I'm sorry, I made a mistake.' I can't buy anything for that. I'm not the type of person who wants to blame a loss or win on the referee but it means you have to win because you win 2-1. I think if it's a rule, it's a rule.\"\n\nTuchel Brands Decision \"Disastrous\" \"The linesman said sorry but that does not help\"\n\nBayern manager Thomas Tuchel, meanwhile, blasted the officials, branding the decision \"disastrous\". He said: \"The linesman said sorry but that does not help. There are two mistakes. The first big mistake is from the linesman. He raised his flag straight away; to raise your flag in a situation like this, you have to be very, very sure it's offside.\n\n\"To have the guts, the balls, to raise the flag like this is a huge, huge call, and it is the wrong call. We got the shot away within five seconds [of the flag] and the referee has the chance not to whistle, but he whistles. It is against every rule.\"\n\nTuchel added: \"We accept that we lost, it is what it is, but it should not have happened. It would not have happened at the other end. It is tough to swallow. I am really angry. If \u00adanyone did not deserve that it's Manuel (Neuer, who made a mistake for Joselu's equaliser).\"\n\nRelated Carlo Ancelotti's Response to Bayern's Referee Complaints The Italian chief brushed aside Bayern Munich's complaints, while also suggesting that Real Madrid were on the wrong side of a controversial call.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeIN_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BeIN Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stoke City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_M\u00fcller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas M\u00fcller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-09-may-2024-08-05-am-2908.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

At that stage -- in the 13th minute of added time -- Madrid were 2-1 up on the night and ahead 4-3 on aggregate following last week's 2-2 draw in Munich.\n\nDe Ligt and Bayern head coach Thomas Tuchel said in separate post-match interviews that Listkiewicz had apologised for the incident. Tuchel said it was a \"disastrous\" decision which \"feels almost like a betrayal\".\n\nHere, The Athletic breaks down the controversial end to the match.\n\nThe ball is played up towards Bayern's Nouassir Mazraoui and De Ligt as the German side chase a late equaliser in the 13th minute of added time.\n\nListkiewicz then flags for an offside as Mazraoui and De Ligt challenge for the ball against Madrid's Ferland Mendy.\n\nReplays show the decision was very close.\n\nAfter Marciniak blows the whistle, Thomas Muller latches on to the loose ball, heads it towards De Ligt who turns and volleys it into the net.\n\nMadrid's players looked to have stopped playing after hearing the whistle but Bayern players and staff were furious, berating the officials before play resumed.\n\nBayern had taken the lead in the 68th minute of the game after Alphonso Davies -- who came on in the first half for the injured Serge Gnabry -- collected a long ball from Harry Kane, cut inside and whipped a shot on his weaker right foot past Andriy Lunin.\n\nIt was another substitute who made the difference for Madrid, with Joselu equalising in the 88th minute and then scoring the winner in the 91st.\n\nThe simple answer is because the assistant referee, Listkiewicz, believed there to be an offside.\n\nHowever, since Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology was introduced in 2016, offsides have been routinely checked after the fact.\n\nIt has become common for assistants to refrain from signalling for an offside, even if it appears obvious in real time, if play is likely to lead to a goal. If one is then scored or the play dies out, often the assistant will then raise their flag to signal an offside.\n\nThe VAR then checks the offside and either confirms the assistant's decision or reverses it. The VAR also checks for any offsides after every goal, so if an offside is missed by the assistant, a goal can still be ruled out after the fact.\n\nThe Champions League also uses semi-automated offside technology, which uses video cameras to monitor around 30 joints on each player's body.\n\nBut, as the whistle had already been blown the play was dead before De Ligt 'scored', the decision could not be reviewed by the VAR.\n\nUEFA has not responded to The Athletic's request for comment on the incident.\n\nBayern players and staff were furious after the decision was made. Tuchel was seen arguing with Listkiewicz while Muller exchanged heated words with Marciniak.\n\n\"Almost there,\" Tuchel told TNT Sports after the game. \"Very unusual mistake of the very best player (Manuel Neuer) for the equaliser. Then we conceded in a very narrow decision in stoppage time.\n\n\"Then we scored one. A disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee. It feels almost like a betrayal in the end because of that decision. It was a huge fight, we left everything on the pitch and we were almost there. Now we have to say congratulations to Real Madrid.\n\n\"The linesman said, 'Sorry' but that does not help. At this level, to raise the flag in a close position like this in the last minute. The referee as well, he does not have to whistle. He sees that we have the second ball, he sees that we get the shot away.\n\n\"To whistle is a very, very bad decision. It's against the rules. It's a bad decision from both of them and it's a disaster. It's tough to swallow but there it is.\"\n\nSpeaking to beIN Sports, De Ligt added: \"The linesman said to me, 'I'm sorry, I made a mistake'. In the end, I'm not the type of person to blame a loss on a referee. But if it's a rule it's a rule.\"\n\nAs UEFA explained in January 2023 following a course for European assistant referees in Rome: \"When the VAR system is in place for a match, assistant referees are being advised not to raise the flag if in doubt about a potential offside situation.\"\n\nUEFA's chief refereeing officer Roberto Rosetti added: \"We need the assistant referees to show their traditional abilities from the past. Accuracy, precision in offside evaluation. But timing is now an essential element of the job - they must know when to raise the flag.\n\n\"If they raise the flag at the wrong moment, problems can arise as far as the final decision is concerned. We've worked hard on the 'flag delay' concept at the course.\"\n\nThe win means Madrid will face Borussia Dortmund in next month's final at Wembley Stadium, after the German side beat Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 at the Parc des Princes in Tuesday's semi-final second leg to secure a 2-0 aggregate victory.\n\nThat game comes on Saturday, June 1 with kick-off at 8pm BST (3pm ET/12pm PT).",

It was a huge call, which was the wrong call. It is against every rule. That would not have happened on the other side. It feels like a betrayal.\"\n\nTo say that Thomas Tuchel was beyond livid with the controversial offside decision during the second leg of Bayern Munich's game against Real Madrid on May 8 would be an understatement.\n\nThe Bavarian giants thought they had scored what would have forced the already dramatic tie to extra time, but the linesman's flag and referee's whistle brought those hopes to a grinding halt.\n\nFor context, the German side were on the cusp of knocking out the record champions after a sublime Alphonso Davies gaol in the 68th minute. However, former Stoke City player, Joselu, came off the bench to score twice in quick succession - the first from a Manuel Neuer mistake - to send Carlo Ancelotti's side through to Wembley.\n\nDeep into stoppage time, Matthijs de Ligt found the back of the net, but the goal couldn't stand or even be referred to the Video Assistant Referee because referee, Szymon Marciniak, had blown the whistle before the Dutch defender had even touched the ball. Fury then followed from Bayern players and those in the team's technical area.\n\nThe German contingent wanted to understand why the referee did not allow that phase of play to end before raising the flag, as it has become the norm. In new rules introduced in the 2021/2022 season, it was agreed that the linesman will intentionally delay raising his flag if he thinks it's an offside.\n\n\"When an immediate goalscoring opportunity is likely to occur, the assistant referee will keep their flag down if they think there is an offside until the passage of play is completed. Once a goal is scored or the chance is gone, the assistant will raise the flag to indicate the initial offence,\" the Premier League website explains.\n\nThe decision will then be referred to the VAR for a final decision to be made.\n\nIn this situation, when Thomas Muller headed down the ball for De Ligt, the linesman was supposed to see how things panned out before raising his flag. Once Marciniak saw the flag, he blew the whistle and Real Madrid players stopped playing even as the ball struck the back of the net.\n\nThe decision couldn't be referred to the VAR because the whistle had already gone, rendering everything as De Ligt played the ball 'inadmissible'.\n\nThere is no telling whether the referee's offside decision was correct, but Bayern deserved the benefit of the doubt. The linesman, as confirmed by Tuchel and De Ligt, did apologise for his mistake, but it was a tad too late.\n\nThierry Henry, who was on pundit duties for CBS, took issue with the centre referee and summarised it perfectly.\n\n\"My view isn't with the linesman. My issue is with the referee. He is the chief. Why do you blow your whistle when you have something [the VAR] that can tell you whether it is offside or not?\"\n\nSports Brief has also reported that Carlo Ancelotti fired back at Thomas Tuchel over the controversial offside decision.\n\nThe veteran Italian manager masterminded another Champions League comeback, but the tie ended in contentious fashion.\n\nHe picked out Real Madrid's goal, which was disallowed for a Nacho Fernandez foul on Joshua Kimmich, as an example.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbrief.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "sportsbrief.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stoke City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymon_Marciniak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Szymon Marciniak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Neuer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nacho (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Kimmich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Kimmich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_M\u00fcller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas M\u00fcller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thierry Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.sportsbrief.com/images/1200x675/a17f8f081e928ace.jpeg?v=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 365, "textEnd": 370}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

'Then we conceded in a very narrow decision, the second one in stoppage time. Then we scored one.\n\n'They have a disastrous decision from the linesman and from the referee. It feels almost like a betrayal in the end because of that decision. It was a huge fight, we left everything on the pitch, we were almost there. Now we have to say congratulations to Real Madrid.\n\n'The linesman said sorry, but that does not help on that kind of level. To raise the flag in a decision like this, a close decision in the last minute. And the referee as well, the referee does not have to whistle. He sees that we win the second ball, he sees that we get a shot away. To whistle is a very, very bad decision.\n\n'It's against the rules and it's a bad decision from both of them. It's a disaster. Tough to swallow but that's the way it is.'\n\nBayern defender Matthijs de Ligt echoed his manager's thoughts, slamming the 'big mistake' from the officials.\n\n\"If it's offside, it's offside. But we made rules in football, if it's not a clear offside, which it wasn't because I haven't seen yet if it was offside or not, you have to keep playing,' said the Dutchman.\n\n'If you go in the last minute, whistle like this, I think this is a big, big mistake. This is a shame. The linesman said to me, \"I'm sorry, I made a mistake.\"\n\n'In the end I'm not the type of person who wants to blame a win or a lose on the referee. Madrid deserves to win because they win 2-1.

Los Blancos scored twice late on to reach a record extending 18th UEFA Champions League final.\n\nIn a rousing semifinal second leg at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday (May 8), both sides had scoring opportunities before Alphonso Davies' brilliant curler gave Bayern the lead midway through the second half.\n\nMoments later, Nacho's equaliser was cancelled out due to foul on Joshua Kimmich in the build-up, which Ancelotti says was a 'dive' from the player. Nevertheless, Los Blancos perservered, capitalising on a rare error from the excellent Manuel Neuer to score an 88th-minute equaliser through substitute Joselu.\n\nThere was more drama in store, though. In the first minute of stoppage time, Antonio Rudiger squared to an unmarked Joselu at the far post for Los Blancos' winner, but De Ligt thought he bagged the equaliser.\n\nHowever, the referee called early for offside, and play stopped, with Ancelotti admitting that the Bayern defender might not have been offside. The Italian, though, added that his team stopped playing, as the referee had called offside before the ball had gone in\n\n\"Bayern complaining about the offside? OK, then we complain about the cancelled goal of Nacho. Kimmich dived,\" he said (as per Bayern & Germany via Madrid Xtra).\n\nAbout De Ligt's offside call, the Real Madrid boss added:\n\n\"The offside episode is simple to explain. Maybe it wasn't offside, but the referee whistled (before the goal), and we stopped playing. That's it.\"\n\nReal Madrid eventually hung on to book a final date with Borussia Dortmund on June 1 at the Wembley as Bayern Munich wonder what might have been.\n\n\"There was a disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee\" - Bayern Munich boss on offside call against Real Madrid\n\nBayern Munich boss Thomas Tuchel understandably had a different take on De Ligt's goal wrongly ruled out for suspected offside against Real Madrid.\n\nThe outgoing Bayern tactician bemoaned the 'disastrous' decision from the on-field officials. Had play continued, VAR would have allowed the goal to stand, but that wasn't the case, as the linesman prematurely called offside, which incensed Tuchel.\n\n\"There was a disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee,\" he told TNT Sports (via BBC). \"It feels like a betrayal in the end. The linesman says sorry. but that does not help. To raise the flag in a moment like this ... The referee sees we get the second ball, and we get the shot. It's hard to swallow, but that's the way it is.\"\n\nDespite referee Szymon Marciniak and the linesman apologising to Bayern for the wrong call, an aggrieved Tuchel added:\n\n\"Everyone has to go to their limit, everyone has to suffer, everyone has to play without making mistakes. So the referee has to be at that level too.\n\n\"It just doesn't help to make excuses after the fact. You are on the field for this reason, because you are the best there is.

The assistant referee flagged for offside in the buildup to rule out the goal, and while replays appeared to show the decision was incorrect, it was not reviewed by VAR.\n\nThe Sporting News explains exactly what happened and why the goal was chalked off, and not reviewed by the offside technology.\n\nMORE: When is the Champions League final between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund?\n\nWith Real Madrid up 2-1 and the match deep into nine minutes of stoppage time, Bayern Munich threw everything forward hoping for a last-gasp equaliser to send the match to extra-time.\n\nA ball from deep was delivered by Bayern Munich towards the top of the penalty area, where Noussair Mazraoui battled for the ball with a defender. With the ball bobbling around, Bayern substitute Thomas Muller pounced, nodding it laterally to defender Matthijs de Ligt who was playing up as a striker as a desperation play from manager Thomas Tuchel.\n\nDe Ligt managed to turn his defender and get on the ball, and rifled a shot past a confused Andriy Lunin who stood still almost as if he had stopped playing. That's because he had indeed stopped playing, because the whistle had blown prior to De Ligt's shot.\n\nThe official had blown his whistle, reacting to the assistant referee who had raised his flag for an offside offence on Mazraoui in the buildup. However, replays in the immediate aftermath showed that Mazraoui was quite tight with Real Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger, and may have actually been onside -- De Ligt was leaning just off, but he did not receive the ball from deep, Mazraoui did, and he was just behind Rudiger.\n\nNo worry, we have semi-automated offside technology to correct the decision, which came into play earlier in the match, seeing a Vinicius Jr goal count after initially being disallowed. Except, it wasn't...why?\n\nMORE: Recap the thrilling Champions League semifinal between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich\n\nWith the incident happening at the very end of the match between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, broadcasters didn't have ample time to inform fans about what happened, and thus viewers will have been left confused about why the Matthijs de Ligt goal wasn't given after being initially ruled out for offside.\n\nIn fact, the incident wasn't even reviewed by VAR, because technically, it never happened. Because the referee blew his whistle before the end of the play, the shot cannot be reviewed by VAR as he stopped play before the shot occurred. That is why Real Madrid goalkeeper Andriy Lunin was standing still as De Ligt put the ball in the net, because he had reacted to the whistle.\n\nThus, the play was not reviewable by VAR. Ever since the introduction of VAR, assistant referees have been instructed to leave their flag down for an extra few beats to allow play to continue, such that if their decision is incorrect, they do not stop a promising attack with the wrong call.\n\nHowever, that instruction was not heeded here by either the assistant referee or the head official.

The Germans were leading 1-0 in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final until the 88th minute, when substitute Joselu struck twice in three minutes. With Bayern behind 2-1 in the 13th minute of stoppage time, Matthijs de Ligt felt he had equalised, but the assistant referee's flag had already been raised for offside. Real defenders came to a halt before De Ligt blasted into the net, and television replays revealed that the original ruling may not have been offside and would have required review by a visual assistance referee [VAR].\n\n\"I think it's pretty clear and there is no doubt that is against the rules of modern football,\" Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel said. \"A disaster. An absolute disaster. With Real's second goal, they let the play continue. The clear rule is that the scene must continue. The first mistake was made by the linesman, the second by the referee,\" he said. Bayern seized the lead with Alphonso Davies' shot midway through the second half, but Real rallied with two late goals from Joselu to secure the final berth. De Ligt claimed the linesman apologised to him after the game.\n\n\"Very difficult. Of course as sportspeople we accept it,\" said Tuchel. \"But it is a semi-final, it's not for two such violations of the rule. Everyone has to be at their limit. The referees have to be there as well. That is what we expect. So the apology does not really help.\" Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer spilled the ball into Joselu's path for the equaliser in the 88th minute, but Tuchel refused to criticise his keeper, who had been superb up to that moment.\n\n\"Ninety-nine out of 100 times he makes it. It is just very, very bitter.

If it's offside or not, I don't know, VAR can check it, but if you don't check it, how can you see it?

Due to the whistle already being blown, VAR could not intervene.\n\nDuring an interview with DAZN, as per BILD, Tuchel was visibly seen fighting back the tears as he hit out at a 'complete violation of the rules'.\n\nThomas Tuchel fought back the tears in a new blast at officials after Bayern Munich were denied a potential late equaliser during their Champions League defeat to Real Madrid\n\nMatthijs de Ligt was denied a late equaliser after it was adjudged there was an offside in the build-up, with the linesman flagging early\n\nBayern Munich were left to rue the controversial decision which otherwise could have seen the game to extra time at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday night\n\nPodcast All episodes PODCAST: Listen to the latest episode of 'It's All Kicking Off!'

It's an absolute disaster.'\n\nHe added: 'Imagine if Real Madrid let them keep running when they score their second goal. It would have been the same, the ball goes to Toni and the whistle is blown. The situation must be played out to the end. That's the rule. Especially when she's so close to the gate.

He doesn't have to whistle, he can just wait and see.\n\n'That's what happened with the second goal.

Everyone is so angry about the second decision because it probably would have counted as a goal.'\n\nTuchel, speaking to TNT Sports, revealed the assistant referee had apologised to him for flagging early in a move that could have cost his team the game.\n\nNoussair Mazraoui (right) thought he had scored a dramatic equaliser in the 103rd minute\n\nBayern players and staff were furious with the decision for the referee to blow the whistle early\n\nTuchel was visibly emotional during his post match interview with DAZN on Wednesday night\n\nHe said: 'We were almost there and a very unusual mistake of the best player (Manuel Neuer) for the equaliser, then we conceded in a very narrow decision in stoppage time.\n\n'Then we scored one and it was a disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee, so it feels almost like a betrayal in the end because of that decision.\n\n'The linesman said sorry. That does not help at that kind of level, to raise the flag in a decision like this, in a close decision in the last minute. The referee as well, he does not have to whistle, he sees that we win the second ball, he sees that we get the shot away. To whistle is a very, very bad decision.\n\n'It is against the rules and it is a bad decision from both of them. It is a disaster, tough to swallow, but it is the way it is.'\n\nMatthijs de Ligt had led the Bayern protests on the pitch, and echoed his manager's comments post-match in that he too had received an apology from the officials.\n\nBayern will now go trophyless for the season for the first time in over a decade.\n\nBayern Munich will finish the season trophyless, while Tuchel will leave the club this summer\n\n'We all know the rules if the offside is not clear then we have to play on,' said the Dutch defender. 'It's a disgrace that it happened against us and not for us at the other end when Joselu was almost offside and the game was allowed to continue.\n\n'A decision like that in the last minute is a mistake It's always easy to talk about the referee after the game but this time it's merited.'\n\nIt has already been confirmed that Tuchel will leave Bayern Munich at the end of the season.\n\nReal Madrid meanwhile will go on to face Bayern's Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund in next month's final at Wembley.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noussair_Mazraoui", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noussair Mazraoui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymon_Marciniak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Szymon Marciniak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoke_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stoke City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bild", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_R\u00fcdiger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antonio R\u00fcdiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Neuer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/09/08/84647997-0-image-m-19_1715238481278.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

He said of the decision by the assistant to raise the flag early: \"I think it is pretty clear - and it can't be any other opinion - that it's against every rule in modern football, what happened.\n\n\"The first big mistake is from the linesman. He raised the flag in a situation like this where you can never, never be sure it's offside. To have the guts to raise the flag is a huge, huge call and it's the wrong call. The referee has the chance not to whistle when we win the second ball and get a shot away within five seconds. He takes the decision to whistle and it's against every rule.\n\nAsked later about De Ligt's post-match suggestion that there had been an apology from the officials, Tuchel became increasingly angry in his post-match press conference. He said: \"We accept the apology. But it's a semi-final. It's not the moment to apologise. It's not the time to make two mistakes that are so important. Everyone is suffering and living on the edge. The referees need to be at the level and it is worthless to apologise. We want the best referees and if he is not able to offer 100 per cent then apologies are worthless.\"\n\nSpeaking to TNT Sports, Tuchel said: \"We are almost through, it's almost there and there was a very unusual mistake from our best player [Manuel Neuer] for the equaliser then we conceded the second one in stoppage time.\n\n\"Then we scored one and there was a disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee. It feels like a betrayal in the end. There was a huge fight. We left everything on the pitch and we were almost there. Now we say congratulations to Real Madrid.\n\n\"The linesman says sorry but that does not help. To raise the flag in a moment like this... The referee sees we get the second ball and we get the shot - it's a very, very bad decision. It's against the rules. It's a disaster. It's hard to swallow but that's the way it is.\"\n\nDe Ligt suggested that the assistant had admitted a mistake was made. The Bayern defender said: \"If it is offside, it is offside, but I think we have rules in football and the rules say if it is not clear then you have to keep playing. And if you go in the last minute and whistle like this - I think it was a big mistake\".\n\nTuchel said that he had no choice but to substitute Harry Kane and Jamal Musiala who were both struggling with injuries and fitness concerns. The England captain has a back issue, Tuchel said.\n\nReal manager Carlo Ancelotti told TNT Sports: \"We believed. Joselu did a fantastic job. He is a fantastic striker. We did really well and had a lot of energy at the end of the game. I'm going to enjoy it of course from now until the final. We have fantastic days with our supporters to celebrate the league. It will be fantastic. Unbelievable [attitude of players].

But since the referee had stopped the game with his whistle following the linesman's decision, VAR was unable to intervene and the goal was not allowed to stand.\n\nFormer Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes would suggest that the sideline official had raised his flag too early. \"I'm not sure it's offside. For the linesman to put his flag up... he's too hasty. He's got to wait,\" Scholes would suggest on TNT Sports.\n\nWhat did the linesman say?\n\nAfter the game, De Ligt conceded that Poland's Szymon Marciniak, the linesman who deemed his run for the stoppage time goal as offside, had apologized to him after the game.\n\n\"The linesman said to me I'm sorry, I made a mistake, I can't buy anything for that. I'm not the type of person who wants to blame a loss or win on the referee but it means you have to win because you win 2-1. I think if it's a rule, it's a rule,\" De Ligt told beIN Sports.\n\nThe Bayern centre-back added, \"I don't want to say that Real Madrid always has the referees with them but that made the difference today.\"\n\nBayern manager Tuchel also lashed out on the decision. \"The linesman said sorry but that does not help,\" the German said. \"He raised his flag straight away; to raise your flag in a situation like this, you have to be very, very sure it's offside. To have the guts, the balls, to raise the flag like this is a huge, huge call, and it is the wrong call. We got the shot away within five seconds [of the flag] and the referee has the chance not to whistle, but he whistles. It is against every rule.\"\n\nWhat is the rule?\n\nAs UEFA explained last year following a course for European assistant referees in Rome: \"When the VAR system is in place for a match, assistant referees are being advised not to raise the flag if in doubt about a potential offside situation.\"\n\nMadrid's rebuttal\n\nReal Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti wasn't reticent in giving it back to his former club.\n\n\"If they can complain about that we can complain about the goal Nacho had disallowed....because Joshua Kimmich had dived,\" he said, referring to a referral by the video assistant

Matthijs de Ligt produced a smart finish, but the linesman's flag had already gone up with the referee whistling.\n\nAs a result the Real keeper didn't attempt to save the effort, but replays showed the decision was a marginal one. Usual protocol now, with VAR in place, is for linesmen to keep their flags down unless the offside is clear, so as to allow VAR to intervene if necessary.\n\nBut the decision to quickly flag for offside meant the officials couldn't go back and check with replays suggesting Bayern's players were onside and the goal should've been given, leading to mass protests on the touchline.\n\nScholes said on TNT Sports: \"I think the linesman puts his flag up too early to be honest. His flag goes up straight away. It is close, we know the defender heads it, even the one in behind De Ligt, I'm not sure he's offside. The linesman is too hasty, he's got to wait, they're the rules! I do think the keeper stop, it is a great finish, would he have saved it anyway?\"\n\nAlphonso Davies had opened the scoring on the night, putting Bayern 1-0 up in Madrid and 3-2 ahead of aggregate. Joselu then scored twice, first in the 89th minute and then again moments later to send the Bernabeu into raptures and set up a Champions League final with Borussia Dortmund.\n\nIt means Thomas Tuchel will depart the German club this summer without winning a trophy this season, but he and his players were left seething at the call.\n\nBayern Munich squandered their lead late on to go out of the Champions League\n\nAfter the game he said \"it was a very, very bad decision\" and \"against the rules\". The ex-Chelsea coach went on to say: \"There was a disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee. It feels like a betrayal in the end. The linesman says sorry but that does not help. To raise the flag in a moment like this... The referee sees we get the second ball and we get the shot. It's hard to swallow but that's the way it is.\"\n\nTuchel also confirmed referee Szymon Marciniak had apologised but that it \"does not help\" with his team out of Europe. \"Everyone has to go to their limit, everyone has to suffer, everyone has to play without making mistakes. So the referee has to be at that level too,\" he added.\n\n\"It just doesn't help to make excuses after the fact. You are on the field for this reason, because you are the best there is. And we have the right to expect that until the end.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Something that has happened time after time, which is inexplicable, has happened again,\" Ancelotti said, referring to the number of late comebacks Madrid has produced in the Champions League in recent seasons.\n\n\"A set of fans who drive us, a stadium that supports us, a stunning atmosphere and a group of players who believe. It's magical.\"\n\nMadrid's first goal came courtesy of a costly error from Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The German had been impressive all game but spilled a simple shot to present Joselu with a chance to score the equalizer in the 88th minute.\n\nThe goal sparked something special inside the newly refurbished Bernab\u00e9u, and it was an atmosphere that pushed Madrid to find the winner in the 91st minute.\n\nFans inside the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u erupted as Real Madrid won the dramatic match. David Ramos/Getty Images\n\nIt was Joselu again who put the ball in the back of the net, but the goal was initially ruled out for offside.\n\nThe stadium held its breath as the video assistant referee (VAR) checked the decision and then erupted when it was decided that neither Antonio R\u00fcdiger, who provided the assist, nor Joselu was offside.\n\nStaff and players flooded off the Madrid bench to celebrate in front of the frenzied crowd, as Bayern players looked crestfallen having seen their hopes of reaching the final slip away in a matter of minutes.\n\nBut, incredibly, the drama wasn't finished yet.\n\nControversial offside flag decision\n\nIn search of an equalizer, Bayern Munich's Matthijs de Ligt did get the ball in the back of Madrid's net in the 13th minute of added time.\n\nHowever, the referee had stopped play just seconds before the defender's shot whistled into the bottom corner, after spotting the linesman had raised his flag.\n\nThis time, VAR could not be used to check the incredibly tight decision because the referee had blown his whistle.\n\nUsually, in such situations, the officials are supposed to let the attacking phase continue before deciding on any offside.\n\nDe Ligt told beIN Sports after the match that the linesman told him, \"I'm sorry, I made a mistake,\" but said that was of little comfort to the side.\n\n\"If it's offside, it's offside, but I think we made rules in football and the rules say if it's not a clear offside, which it wasn't ... you have to keep playing,\" he said postmatch. \"And if you go in the last minute and whistle like this, yeah, I think this is a big, big, big mistake. If it's offside or not, I don't know, you can check it. But if you don't check it, how can you see it?\"\n\nBayern manager Thomas Tuchel also said the linesman apologized for raising his flag too early, but the German said such an apology \"does not help\" and criticized the referee for blowing the whistle too early.\n\n\"It almost feels like a betrayal because of that decision,\" Tuchel told TNT Sports after the match.\n\n\"It's a very, very bad decision. It's against the rules [...] it's tough to swallow, but it's the way it is.\"\n\nWhile Tuchel and de Ligt were unhappy with the officials, they both accepted the defeat and congratulated Madrid for making yet another final.\n\nBayern manager Thomas Tuchel was furious at the officials after the game. S. Mellar/FC Bayern/Getty Images\n\nThe manager, though, came in for criticism himself for his decision to take Harry Kane off in the 85th minute.\n\nIn addition to his attacking threats, the English striker has somewhat perfected the art of running down the clock and his physical presence was needed in the final minutes of the game.\n\nTuchel, though, told critics that Kane was unable to give anymore in the match.\n\nFrom fan to hero\n\nAfter the full-time whistle, Madrid celebrated in style as it crowned Joselu the club's new hero.\n\nThe striker had initially struggled after his loan move from second division Espanyol to the Spanish giant but has now written his name in the club's storied history.\n\nFollowing his match-winning exploits, pictures of the striker in Paris supporting Madrid at the 2022 Champions League final spread on social media - two years later and the 34-year-old inspired his team to the pinnacle of European soccer.\n\n\"My dreams aren't as beautiful as what happened today. As a forward, you dream of scoring goals, and if they're like tonight's, then even better,\" Joselu said after the match.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors":

for silverware, and Tuchel made the surprise decision to replace the former Tottenham forward in the 85th minute with Bayern leading.\n\nWhile Tuchel was not asked specifically about Kane being taken

Thomas M\u00fcller kept the ball alive in Madrid's box, and De Ligt shot low past Andriy Lunin.\n\nWhen the ball was played forward, De Ligt was offside but did not seem to touch it in the first phase of play. Mazraoui, who did, was immediately flagged offside and a free-kick was given seconds before De Ligt's finish.\n\nIt was not easy to judge from video replays whether Mazraoui was offside or not, but as soon as the linesman raised the flag for offside, the referee stopped the game, preventing VAR from checking the decision, as would normally have been the case.\n\n\"A disaster. An absolute disaster. With Real's second goal, they let the play continue. The clear rule is that the scene must continue. The first mistake was made by the linesman, the second by the referee,\" Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel said after the match.\n\nALSO READ: Far from a Galactico, Joselu produces a galactic night for Real Madrid in the Champions League\n\n\"Very difficult. Of course, as sportspeople we accept it,\" said Tuchel. \"But it is a semifinal, it's not for two such violations of the rule. Everyone has to be at their limit. The referees have to be there as well.\"\n\n\"That is what we expect. So the apology does not really help.\"\n\nDe Ligt said in a post-match interview that the linesman had apologised to him for the hasty decision and not allowing the game to continue.\n\nLatest on SportstarNBA: Jalen Brunson shakes off injury, sends Knicks past Pacers ReutersExplained: Why was Bayern Munich's late goal ruled out against Real Madrid in UCL 2023-24 semifinal?

Now we have to congratulate Real Madrid,\" he said at the first event.\n\n\"The linesman apologised... the umpire didn't need to allow it: he sees we won the second ball, he sees we took a long shot,\" he added. \"It's a very bad decision to blow the whistle. It's against the rules and it's a bad decision for both of us. It's a disaster, it's hard to accept, but that's the way things are.\"\n\nAfter the game, he said the referee had not given Bayern the same chance as Madrid, pointing to Joselu's winning goal, which was called for offside after being scored and later awarded by the referee (VAR).\n\n\"I think we all know the rules. If it's not clear offside, you have to keep playing! That's the rule! I'm a bit embarrassed about it. Joselu's goal was almost offside, and they keep going\" . Playing, why not with us?\" de Ligt said.\n\nMadrid coach Carlo Ancelotti dismissed Bayern's complaints in his post-match press conference. He pointed out that his side had canceled out Nacho Fernandez's equalizer due to Joshua Kimmich being pushed on, which Ancelotti said \"jumped\".\n\n\"The play is very clear, the linesman raised his flag, the referee blew the whistle and we stopped,\" Ancelotti said. \"If they complain about that, we can complain about Nacho's disallowed goal because Kimmich jumped and they both pushed each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "amicohoops.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Amico Hoops"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arzu_daniel@amicohoops.net", "name": "Arzu Daniel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nacho (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Kimmich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Kimmich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0508%2Fr1330353_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The two teams have met time and time again in the biggest club competition in the world.\n\nOn Wednesday, the two teams met in an epic battle at the Santiago Bernabeu with Real Madrid progressing to their 18th Champions League final.\n\nUnfortunately, in what was a chaotic final 20 minutes of the game which saw two goals being scored, two goals being disallowed and many fights breaking out, the brilliance of the two teams was overshadowed by controversy with Bayern defender, Matthijs De Ligt even claiming that the assistant referee apologised for the late call which saw the referee blow the whistle on an offside decision seconds before the Dutch center back scored what would have been the equalizer.\n\nFollowing the emotional encounter, many players and both coaches had a lot to say about what just transpired on the pitch.\n\n\"The linesman said to me, 'I'm sorry, I made a mistake', The rule says that if it's not clear offside, you have to keep playing and if you go in the last minute and you whistle like this, I think this is a big mistake. If it's offside or not, I don't know, VAR can check it, but if you don't check it, how can you see it? This is a shame,\" said a dejected Matthijs De Ligt.\n\n\"Very difficult. This is a semifinal, it's not the moment for apologies. Really not. It's not the moment for two huge violations of rules and then an apology. We all have to go to our limits, all have to suffer, all have to play without mistakes. The referees at this level also have to do that.

Maybe it wasn't offside, but the referee whistled (before the goal) and we stopped playing. That's it. Bayern complaining about the offside? OK, then we complain about the canceled goal of Nacho.

It looked as though Konrad Laimer had taken the tie to extra-time by scoring with practically the last kick of the game, but the goal was ruled out for offside by the linesman.\n\nReplays showed that the decision was tight and the incident wasn't checked by VAR given that the offside flag had been raised early.\n\nAn irate Tuchel branded the incident a \"betrayal\" in his post-match interview with TNT Sports, with the outgoing Bayern Munich chief also revealing that the officials had already apologised.\n\nHe raged: \"We are almost through, it's almost there and there was a very unusual mistake from our best player for the equaliser then we conceded the second one in stoppage time.\n\n\"Then we scored one and there was a disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee.

first time since the 2011-2012 season after missing out on the Bundesliga title to Bayer Leverkusen and being knocked out of the German Cup by lower league opposition.\n\nIt could have been so different for Bayern, and it looked like it was going to be an all German final against Borussia Dortmund after Alphonso Davies gave Tuchel's side the lead with a brilliant strike.\n\nHowever a rare mistake from Manuel Neuer allowed Joselu to score the equaliser in the 88th minute and the Spaniard popped up again in the 91st minute as he tapped home Antonio Rudiger's cross.\n\nBayern thought they had sent the game into extra time when Matthijs de Ligt fired Thomas Muller's knockdown into the back of the net, but the referee had already blown for offside.\n\nReplays suggested it was a tight call, but VAR were unable to intervene as the referee had blown his whistle in play which stopped the move from developing.\n\nBayern players were visibly furious with the decision and after the game Tuchel revealed the linesman had apologised.\n\n\"It was a disastrous decision from the linesman, and from the referee\", the German told TNT Sports.\n\n\"It feels almost like a betrayal in the end,

Then we scored one and they have a disastrous decision from the linesman and from the referee.\n\n\"So, it feels almost like a betrayal in the end because of that decision. It was a huge fight, we left everything on the pitch and we were almost there. Now we have to say congratulations to Real Madrid.\n\n\"The linesman said sorry, but that does not help. At that kind of level, to raise the flag in a decision like this, a close decision, in the last minute and the referee as well.\n\n\"The referee does not have to whistle. He sees that we win the second ball, he sees that we get a shot away and to whistle is a very, very bad decision.\n\n\"And it is against the rules and it is a bad decision from both of them. It is a disaster. Tough to swallow, but that is the way it is.\"\n\nAn intriguing subplot was Kane up against compatriot Jude Bellingham, who produced an all-action display and helped set up a Wembley showdown with old club Borussia Dortmund on June 1.\n\nIt was a different story for Kane after this loss extended his wait for silverware, and Tuchel made the surprise decision to replace the former Tottenham forward in the 85th minute with Bayern leading.\n\nWhile Tuchel was not asked specifically about Kane being taken off, he said: \"Part of the story is we start with a front four and all four players need to go out because of injuries and cramps.", "source": {"uri": "thetelegraphandargus.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Telegraph and Argus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A violation of the rules. This scene must be played out to the end. That's the rule. The linesman made the mistake, and the referee made the second mistake.

The Germans surged forward after two quick Real Madrid goals had turned the tie on its head, but De Ligt saw the offside flag go up moments before his smart finish.\n\nThe referee whistled and that ruled out the chance for VAR to intervene with replays showing the two Bayern players in question appeared to be onside.

Then we scored one and they have a disastrous decision from the linesman and from the referee.\n\n\"So, it feels almost like a betrayal in the end because of that decision. It was a huge fight, we left everything on the pitch and we were almost there. Now we have to say congratulations to Real Madrid.\n\n\"The linesman said sorry, but that does not help. At that kind of level, to raise the flag in a decision like this, a close decision, in the last minute and the referee as well.\n\n\"The referee does not have to whistle. He sees that we win the second ball, he sees that we get a shot away and to whistle is a very, very bad decision.\n\n\"And it is against the rules and it is a bad decision from both of them. It is a disaster. Tough to swallow, but that is the way it is.\"\n\nAn intriguing subplot was Kane up against compatriot Jude Bellingham, who produced an all-action display and helped set up a Wembley showdown with old club Borussia Dortmund on June 1.\n\nUNIQUE TO F365: Mediawatch | Mailbox | Winners & Losers | Bespoke Prem tables\n\nIt was a different story for Kane after this loss extended his wait for silverware, and Tuchel made the surprise decision to replace the former Tottenham forward in the 85th minute with Bayern leading.\n\nTuchel defended his decision after the game, claiming: \"He couldn't keep going. He played with back pain and he couldn't keep going, his back froze up.\n\n\"Part of the story is we start with a front four and all four players need to go out because of injuries and cramps.",

Trailing 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu, Bayern thought they had salvaged a lifeline when Matthijs de Ligt found the back of the net with a late equaliser. However, celebration turned to disbelief as the goal was disallowed due to a contentious offside call.\n\nThe controversy stemmed from a ball played into the Bayern box, where Leroy Sane seemed poised to pounce. Real Madrid's Ferland Mendy outjumped Sane to head the ball away, but the linesman swiftly raised his flag, flagging Sane offside. Before the ball even nestled into the net, the referee blew his whistle, halting play and denying Bayern their crucial equaliser.\n\nSocial media erupts with Bayern Munich fans\n\nFootball fans took to social media to express their outrage over the controversial decision. Many argued that the offside call was questionable at best and called for VAR intervention. The consensus among fans was that Bayern had been robbed of a legitimate chance to equalise, with some labelling the decision a catastrophe for football.\n\nThe @thefutballboy_1 wrote on social media: \"In all honesty, this is not offside, and even if it was, it's a close close call, and the rules say \"Players must keep playing until the attack is over, then check VAR\". Bayern got robbed!\"\n\n@HLTCO said: \"It's absolutely bonkers that they've blown up and not allowed VAR to determine whether or not that was offside.\"\n\n\"Linesmen and refs let players run through on goal for ages even if it's clearly offside, potentially causing injury,\" @lawrence_bury said. \"The one time in ages I have seen an instant whistle blow is tonight, at the highest level. Why? It's a catastrophe to football how bad the game is being managed.\"\n\n\"I refuse to believe that this is offside lmao,\" @CFC_Iann said. \"De ligt is offside but he doesn't even touch the ball, the linesman f*cked up the game.\"\n\n@Thomasjrennie wrote: \"Hold on. He's onside there isn't he? That's a balls up there from the linesman. When you think about all the times they play on when you KNOW someone is offside.\"\n\nBayern coach Thomas Tuchel was visibly incensed by the decision and didn't hold back his frustration. He received a yellow card for his vociferous protests aimed at the linesman. Speaking after the match, Tuchel labelled the incident an \"absolute disaster\" and criticised the officials for violating the rules by prematurely halting play.\n\nTuchel told DAZN: \"It's an absolute disaster. This scene must be played out to the end. That's the rule. The linesman made the mistake, and the referee made the second mistake. It's a violation of the rules.\"\n\nMatthijs de Ligt, the player at the centre of the offside controversy, shed light on the aftermath of the incident. He revealed that the linesman had apologised to him for the erroneous call, admitting his mistake. \"I don't want to say that Real Madrid always has the referees with them but that made the difference today.\" He added to Bein Sports: \"The linesman told me: 'Sorry, I made a mistake'.\" De Ligt's comments added fuel to the fire, with many questioning the impartiality of the officials.\n\nWhat lies ahead for Bayern Munich and Real Madrid\n\nWhile Bayern Munich's season ended in disappointment, Real Madrid marched on to the Champions League final. They are set to face Borussia Dortmund in a bid to clinch their 15th European title. However, the controversial decision against Bayern will undoubtedly linger in the minds of fans and players alike, casting a shadow over an otherwise thrilling encounter.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferland_Mendy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferland Mendy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeIN_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BeIN Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bayern-Munich-news-Matthijs-de-Ligt-suffers-disastrous-injury.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Real Madrid came back from a 1-0 deficit to win the clash by 4-3 on aggregate, thanks to Joselu's brace in the dying moments of the match and secure their spot in what will be their 18th UCL final. However, the match was stamped by yet another controversial refereeing call, when De Ligt's stoppage time strike was falsely ruled offside, without even a proper VAR check. Since the final whistle of the high-value clash on Wednesday, the football world is yet again in argument about whether the proceedings were too harsh on the German giants.\n\nHaving drawn 2-2 against Carlo Ancelotti-managed Madrid in the first leg at the Allianz arena, Bayern saw themselves get a lead in the second leg due to a 68th minute strike from Alphonse Daives. However, Real Madrid's phenomenal clutch-ability in the competition, saw themselves secure their ticket to the Final at Wembley against Borussia Dortmund. But, De Ligt's ruled out goal has been a constant talking point amongst football pundits, on whether the match should have indeed headed into extra-time.\n\nSpeaking to beIN sports, De Ligt revealed how the linesman apologised and admitted to making an error with the offside call.\n\n\"The linesman said to me, 'I'm sorry, I made a mistake,' I can't buy anything for that. I'm not the type of person who wants to blame a loss or win on the referee, but it means you have to win because you win 2-1. I think if it's a rule, it's a rule,\" De Ligt said.\n\n'If it's offside, it's offside. But I think we made rules in football and the rules are if it's not a clear offside - which it wasn't because I don't see it yet if it's offside or not - you have to keep playing...If you go in the last minutes and you whistle like this, I think it's a big mistake. If it's offside or not, you can check it, but if you don't check it, how can you see it? The second goal, Rudiger is almost offside. If he whistles ok, but now there's a difference and this is a shame,\" De light added.\n\nUpon the game walking into the 13th minute of added time, De Ligt hit a deflected ball into the Real Madrid net, only seconds after the referee blew the whistle that deemed him offside.\n\nHowever, upon watching the replay, one can easily judge that De Ligt was considerably within the line of the Real Madrid defence.\n\nDue to the linesman raising his flag, which led to the referee blowing the whistle, the Real Madrid defenders, including goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, halted in their positions, withdrawing from play due to the apparent offside call. The argument around this scenario has put constant highlight on how the modern-day rules of football deem it unnecessary for the referee to stop the play, and only base his decision upon VAR inspection.\n\nWith Real Madrid having already won this year's La Liga title, Los Blancos will be heading to Wembley with some added confidence for their Final against Dortmund on June 2.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeIN_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BeIN Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Lunin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andriy Lunin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_the_Game_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laws of the Game (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/matthijs-de-ligt-093946113-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=ERwHxNaCkn25q3okLjkyGxWcNWBbxEJ6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 223, "textEnd": 228}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 3188, "textEnd": 3194}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Something that has happened time after time, which is inexplicable, has happened again,\" Ancelotti said, referring to the number of late comebacks Madrid has produced in the Champions League in recent seasons.\n\n\"A set of fans who drive us, a stadium that supports us, a stunning atmosphere and a group of players who believe. It's magical.\"\n\nMadrid's first goal came courtesy of a costly error from Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The German had been impressive all game but spilled a simple shot to present Joselu with a chance to score the equalizer in the 88th minute.\n\nThe goal sparked something special inside the newly refurbished Bernab\u00e9u, and it was an atmosphere that pushed Madrid to find the winner in the 91st minute.\n\nIt was Joselu again who put the ball in the back of the net, but the goal was initially ruled out for offside.\n\nThe stadium held its breath as the video assistant referee (VAR) checked the decision and then erupted when it was decided that neither Antonio R\u00fcdiger, who provided the assist, nor Joselu was offside.\n\nStaff and players flooded off the Madrid bench to celebrate in front of the frenzied crowd, as Bayern players looked crestfallen having seen their hopes of reaching the final slip away in a matter of minutes.\n\nBut, incredibly, the drama wasn't finished yet.\n\nIn search of an equalizer, Bayern Munich's Matthijs de Ligt did get the ball in the back of Madrid's net in the 13th minute of added time.\n\nHowever, the referee had stopped play just seconds before the defender's shot whistled into the bottom corner, after spotting the linesman had raised his flag.\n\nThis time, VAR could not be used to check the incredibly tight decision because the referee had blown his whistle.\n\nUsually, in such situations, the officials are supposed to let the attacking phase continue before deciding on any offside.\n\nDe Ligt told beIN Sports after the match that the linesman told him, \"I'm sorry, I made a mistake,\" but said that was of little comfort to the side.\n\n\"If it's offside, it's offside, but I think we made rules in football and the rules say if it's not a clear offside, which it wasn't ... you have to keep playing,\" he said postmatch. \"And if you go in the last minute and whistle like this, yeah, I think this is a big, big, big mistake. If it's offside or not, I don't know, you can check it. But if you don't check it, how can you see it?\"\n\nBayern manager Thomas Tuchel also said the linesman apologized for raising his flag too early, but the German said such an apology \"does not help\" and criticized the referee for blowing the whistle too early.\n\n\"It almost feels like a betrayal because of that decision,\" Tuchel told TNT Sports after the match.\n\n\"It's a very, very bad decision. It's against the rules [...] it's tough to swallow, but it's the way it is.\"\n\nWhile Tuchel and de Ligt were unhappy with the officials, they both accepted the defeat and congratulated Madrid for making yet another final.\n\nThe manager, though, came in for criticism himself for his decision to take Harry Kane off in the 85th minute.\n\nIn addition to his attacking threats, the English striker has somewhat perfected the art of running down the clock and his physical presence was needed in the final minutes of the game.\n\nTuchel, though, told critics that Kane was unable to give anymore in the match.\n\nAfter the full-time whistle, Madrid celebrated in style as it crowned Joselu the club's new hero.\n\nThe striker had initially struggled after his loan move from second division Espanyol to the Spanish giant but has now written his name in the club's storied history.\n\nFollowing his match-winning exploits, pictures of the striker in Paris supporting Madrid at the 2022 Champions League final spread on social media - two years later and the 34-year-old inspired his team to the pinnacle of European soccer.\n\n\"My dreams aren't as beautiful as what happened today.

An absolute disaster. With Real's second goal, they let the play continue. The clear rule is that the scene must continue. The first mistake was made by the linesman, the second by the referee,\" he said.\n\nBayern took the lead with Alphonso Davies' shot midway through the second half but Real battled back with two late goals from Joselu to book their final spot.\n\nDe Ligt said the linesman had apologised to him after the game.\n\n\"Very difficult. Of course as sportspeople we accept it,\" said Tuchel. \"But it is a semi-final, it's not for two such violations of the rule. Everyone has to be at their limit. The referees have to be there as well.\"\n\n\"That is what we expect. So the apology does not really help.\"\n\nBayern keeper Manuel Neuer spilled the ball into Joselu's path for the equaliser in the 88th minute but Tuchel did not want to blame his keeper who had been outstanding up to that point.\n\n\"Ninety-nine out of 100 times he makes it. It is just very, very bitter. No-one will point a finger at him and he is the most unhappy one,\" said the coach.\n\nReal progressed to their sixth Champions League final in 10 years and will bid for a record-extending 15th title against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on June 1.

It would have been the same, the ball goes to Toni and the whistle is blown. The situation must be played out to the end. That's the rule. Especially when she's so close to the gate. Especially when it's so tight.\n\n'The assistant makes the first mistake, the referee makes the second mistake. He doesn't have to whistle, he can just wait and see.\n\n'That's what happened with the second goal. This is a violation of the rules.'\n\nOfficials are generally advised to delay their offside calls in case they are wrong, although it is not clear why this did not happen in Madrid.\n\nTuchel told TNT Sports the assistant referee had apologised to him for flagging early in a move that could have cost his team the game.\n\nDe Ligt told beIN SPORTS that the linesman apologised to him for the decision as well.\n\nDe Ligt led the on-pitch protests, but because the flag was already up, nothing could be done\n\nDe Ligt told beIN SPORTS that the linesman apologised to him for the decision as well\n\nHe added: 'The linesman said to me I'm sorry, I made a mistake, I can't buy anything for that.

Something that has happened time after time, which is inexplicable, has happened again,\" Ancelotti said, referring to the number of late comebacks Madrid has produced in the Champions League in recent seasons.\n\n\"A set of fans who drive us, a stadium that supports us, a stunning atmosphere and a group of players who believe. It's magical.\"\n\nMadrid's first goal came courtesy of a costly error from Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The German had been impressive all game but spilled a simple shot to present Joselu with a chance to score the equalizer in the 88th minute.\n\nThe goal sparked something special inside the newly refurbished Bernab\u00e9u, and it was an atmosphere that pushed Madrid to find the winner in the 91st minute.\n\nIt was Joselu again who put the ball in the back of the net, but the goal was initially ruled out for offside.\n\nThe stadium held its breath as the video assistant referee (VAR) checked the decision and then erupted when it was decided that neither Antonio R\u00fcdiger, who provided the assist, nor Joselu was offside.\n\nStaff and players flooded off the Madrid bench to celebrate in front of the frenzied crowd, as Bayern players looked crestfallen having seen their hopes of reaching the final slip away in a matter of minutes.\n\nBut, incredibly, the drama wasn't finished yet.\n\nControversial offside flag decision\n\nIn search of an equalizer, Bayern Munich's Matthijs de Ligt did get the ball in the back of Madrid's net in the 13th minute of added time.\n\nHowever, the referee had stopped play just seconds before the defender's shot whistled into the bottom corner, after spotting the linesman had raised his flag.\n\nThis time, VAR could not be used to check the incredibly tight decision because the referee had blown his whistle.\n\nUsually, in such situations, the officials are supposed to let the attacking phase continue before deciding on any offside.\n\nDe Ligt told beIN Sports after the match that the linesman told him, \"I'm sorry, I made a mistake,\" but said that was of little comfort to the side.\n\n\"If it's offside, it's offside, but I think we made rules in football and the rules say if it's not a clear offside, which it wasn't ... you have to keep playing,\" he said postmatch. \"And if you go in the last minute and whistle like this, yeah, I think this is a big, big, big mistake. If it's offside or not, I don't know, you can check it. But if you don't check it, how can you see it?\"\n\nBayern manager Thomas Tuchel also said the linesman apologized for raising his flag too early, but the German said such an apology \"does not help\" and criticized the referee for blowing the whistle too early.\n\n\"It almost feels like a betrayal because of that decision,\" Tuchel told TNT Sports after the match.\n\n\"It's a very, very bad decision. It's against the rules [...] it's tough to swallow, but it's the way it is.\"\n\nWhile Tuchel and de Ligt were unhappy with the officials, they both accepted the defeat and congratulated Madrid for making yet another final.\n\nThe manager, though, came in for criticism himself for his decision to take Harry Kane off in the 85th minute.\n\nIn addition to his attacking threats, the English striker has somewhat perfected the art of running down the clock and his physical presence was needed in the final minutes of the game.\n\nTuchel, though, told critics that Kane was unable to give anymore in the match.\n\nFrom fan to hero\n\nAfter the full-time whistle, Madrid celebrated in style as it crowned Joselu the club's new hero.\n\nThe striker had initially struggled after his loan move from second division Espanyol to the Spanish giant but has now written his name in the club's storied history.\n\nFollowing his match-winning exploits, pictures of the striker in Paris supporting Madrid at the 2022 Champions League final spread on social media - two years later and the 34-year-old inspired his team to the pinnacle of European soccer.\n\n\"My dreams aren't as beautiful as what happened today.

After the match, he told broadcaster DAZN the decision was \"a disaster, an absolute disaster\".\n\n\"We have to let the action play out until the end. That's the rule, especially since it's so close to the goal, and it's so limited.\n\n\"The first error is made by the linesman, the second comes from the referee,\" Tuchel said.\n\nThe 50-year-old coach told broadcaster TNT the decision \"felt like a betrayal\".\n\nSpeaking at the press conference, Tuchel said the referee apologised but added: \"It doesn't help to say sorry.\n\n\"Everyone has to go to their limit, everyone has to suffer, everyone has to play without making mistakes. So the referee has to be at that level too.\n\n\"It just doesn't help to make excuses after the fact.\n\n\"You are on the field for this reason, because you are the best there is. And we have the right to expect that until the end.\"\n\nThe goalscorer De Ligt agreed with his coach, calling the decision decisive in the match.\n\n\"The scene at the end, I find it incredible. I can't understand why he (the referee) doesn't let the action play out.\n\n\"He apologised. I wouldn't want to say that Real are always lucky, but that decision makes the difference today,\" De Ligt told DAZN.\n\nA disappointed Bayern captain Manuel Neuer said: \"We're in the Champions League semi-finals...

It was a huge fight, we left everything on the pitch and we were almost there. Now we have to say congratulations to Real Madrid.\n\n\"The linesman said sorry, but that does not help. At that kind of level, to raise the flag in a decision like this, a close decision, in the last minute -- and the referee as well.\n\n\"The referee does not have to whistle. He sees that we win the second ball, he sees that we get a shot away and to whistle is a very, very bad decision.\n\n\"And it is against the rules and it is a bad decision from both of them. It is a disaster. Tough to swallow, but that is the way it is.\"\n\nWhile there has been no clarification or comment from Uefa, the officials could point to the VAR protocols published by the International Football Association Board, which state that an assistant referee's offside flag should only be delayed \"in a very clear attacking situation when a player is about to score a goal or has a clear run into/towards the opponents' penalty area.\"\n\nTwo goals from Joselu helped Real recover from a goal down to win 4-3 on aggregate. They will now go on to face Borussia Dortmund in the final at Wembley on June 1.\n\nEnglish officials Michael Oliver and Anthony Taylor -- both highly regarded by Uefa -- could be in contention to referee the match. The appointments for all three men's club competition finals will be announced by Uefa on Monday.\n\nAn intriguing subplot was Harry Kane up against compatriot Jude Bellingham, who produced an all-action display and helped set up a Wembley showdown with old club Borussia Dortmund on June 1.\n\nIt was a different story for Kane after this loss extended his wait for silverware, and Tuchel made the surprise decision to replace the former Tottenham forward in the 85th minute with Bayern leading.\n\nWhile Tuchel was not asked specifically about Kane being taken off, he said: \"Part of the story is we start with a front four and all four players need to go out because of injuries and cramps.", "source": {"uri": "morningstaronline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morning Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymon_Marciniak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Szymon Marciniak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Oliver_(referee)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Oliver (referee)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Taylor_(referee)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Taylor (referee)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Football Association Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://morningstaronline.co.uk/sites/default/files/Champions%20league%20semi%20final.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2098, "textEnd": 2104, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

De Ligt scored the contentious goal in the stoppage time but it was ruled out as the linesman had raised the offside flag.\n\nSpeaking after the match, the Dutchman rued that the lapse of judgement from the referee had cost his team a place in the UCL final.\n\n\"The rule says that if it's not clear offside...you have to keep playing.\" De Ligt said. \"And if you go in the last minute and you whistle like this, I think this is a big mistake. If it's offside or not, I don't know, VAR can check it, but if you don't check it, how can you see it? This is a shame.\"\n\nThe offside on the De Ligt goal looked close to the naked eye but since the whistle was blown, VAR could not involve itself in the recheck process.\n\nDe Ligt's sentiments were echoed by manager Thomas Tuchel who said it was a 'disaster' that the referee chalked off the goal.\n\n\"I think it's pretty clear and there is no doubt that is against the rules of modern football. A disaster. An absolute disaster,\" said Tuchel.\n\n\"Very difficult. Of course as sportspeople we accept it. But it is a semi-final, it's not for two such violations of the rule. Everyone has to be at their limit. The referees have to be there as well. That is what we expect. So the apology does not really help.\"\n\nAlso read | 'Absolute disaster': Thomas Tuchel fumes over Bayern's late disallowed goal against Madrid\n\nMeanwhile, Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti shrugged off the controversy saying a similar goal was ruled out for his side when Nacho scored from inside the box.\n\n\"The last play is clear, the referee blows the whistle and we stop,\" he said. \"This referee is very good, he refereed in a World Cup final.

The two teams have met time and time again in the biggest club competition in the world.\n\nOn Wednesday, the two teams met in an epic battle at the Santiago Bernabeu with Real Madrid progressing to their 18th Champions League final.\n\nUnfortunately, in what was a chaotic final 20 minutes of the game which saw two goals being scored, two goals being disallowed and many fights breaking out, the brilliance of the two teams was overshadowed by controversy with Bayern defender, Matthijs De Ligt even claiming that the assistant referee apologised for the late call which saw the referee blow the whistle on an offside decision seconds before the Dutch center back scored what would have been the equalizer.\n\nFollowing the emotional encounter, many players and both coaches had a lot to say about what just transpired on the pitch.\n\n\"The linesman said to me, 'I'm sorry, I made a mistake', The rule says that if it's not clear offside, you have to keep playing and if you go in the last minute and you whistle like this, I think this is a big mistake. If it's offside or not, I don't know, VAR can check it, but if you don't check it, how can you see it? This is a shame,\" said a dejected Matthijs De Ligt.\n\n\"Very difficult. This is a semifinal, it's not the moment for apologies. Really not. It's not the moment for two huge violations of rules and then an apology. We all have to go to our limits, all have to suffer, all have to play without mistakes. The referees at this level also have to do that. When you don't deliver, it doesn't help when you apologize, even though of course as sportsmen we accept it,\" said FC Bayern manager, Thomas Tuchel.\n\nThe moment was brilliant, to score my first Champions League goal against a team like Madrid but when it's all said and done, we didn't make it to the final,\" said Alphonso Davies who has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid this summer.\n\n\"The offside episode is simple to explain. Maybe it wasn't offside, but the referee whistled (before the goal) and we stopped playing. That's it. Bayern complaining about the offside? OK, then we complain about the canceled goal of Nacho. Kimmich dived,\" said Ancelotti.\n\n\"We put Real Madrid in another final, today we played for our injured teammates, for our family, for the Bernab\u00e9u and we played for this shirt that always does incredible things,\" said the Man of the Match, Vinicius Jr.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_UEFA_Champions_League_final", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021 UEFA Champions League final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_competitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA competitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nacho_(footballer,_born_1990)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nacho (footballer, born 1990)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Kimmich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Kimmich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/202405093158479.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Vardrid is a term used to mock Real Madrid owing to what many football fans believe is a clear bias present in the game of referees and the VAR favouring Real Madrid during matches.\n\nBayern took the lead with a stunning goal from Alphonso Davies, while goalkeeper Manuel Neuer made some excellent saves to maintain their advantage.\n\nHowever, Real Madrid ultimately secured the victory to advance to the final.\n\nHowever, a blunder by Neuer allowed Joselu to snatch the ball and slide it into the net to level the score in the 88th minute.\n\nJust two minutes later, Real Madrid went ahead in the game and the overall tie, with Joselu converting a cross from Antonio Rudiger, igniting pandemonium inside the Bernabeu.\n\nThis came after VAR overturned a call to disallow the goal due to offside. Bayern thought they had scored when Konrad Laimer drilled Thomas Muller's knockdown into the bottom corner, but referee Szymon Marciniak had already stopped play, signaling offside.\n\nSince the whistle was blown during the play, VAR could not review or overturn the decision.\n\nReplays indicated that the offside call was extremely close, leading to frustration among Bayern players, who were upset that the play was halted prematurely.\n\nSpeaking after the match, Tuchel revealed that the assistant referee apologized to the Bayern players right after the controversial incident.\n\nHe stated, \"The linesman's decision was terrible, and the referee's call was just as bad. It feels like we've been betrayed because of that call. Still, we have to congratulate Real Madrid.\"\n\nTuchel concluded, \"It was a really poor decision, and it went against the rules. It's a hard pill to swallow, but that's how it is.\"\n\nBayern's sporting director, Max Eberl, later stated that referee Marciniak had apologized to him regarding the incident.\n\nAt the same time, defender Matthijs de Ligt echoed these sentiments, calling the decision a \"major, major error,\" and confirmed Tuchel's claim that the linesman had offered an apology about the situation.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsgrail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsGrail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Neuer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Laimer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Konrad Laimer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_R\u00fcdiger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antonio R\u00fcdiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_M\u00fcller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas M\u00fcller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymon_Marciniak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Szymon Marciniak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Education and Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/thesportsgrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Real-Madrid-1.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

He raised the flag in a situation like this where you can never, never be sure it's offside. To have the guts to raise the flag is a huge, huge call and it's the wrong call. The referee has the chance not to whistle when we win the second ball and get a shot away within five seconds. He takes the decision to whistle and it's against every rule.\"\n\nAnd speaking on TNT Sports, the German said: \"That was an absolute disaster. A violation of the rules.\n\n\"This scene must be played out to the end. That's the rule. The linesman made the mistake, and the referee made the second mistake.\n\n\"We were almost there and a very unusual mistake of the best player [Manuel Neuer] for the equaliser, then we conceded in a very narrow decision in stoppage time. Then we scored one and it was a disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee, so it feels almost like a betrayal in the end because of that decision.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The linesman said sorry. That does not help at that kind of level, to raise the flag in a decision like this, in a close decision in the last minute. The referee as well, he does not have to whistle, he sees that we win the second ball, he sees that we get the shot away. To whistle is a very, very bad decision.\n\n\"It is against the rules and it is a bad decision from both of them. It is a disaster, tough to swallow, but it is the way it is.\"\n\nWhat is Uefa's rule on delaying the offside flag?\n\nAccording to guidance from Ifab - the governing body of football's laws - on adjudicating offsides when VAR is in use, assistant referees can delay raising the flag in clear attacking situations, allowing play to continue. The regulations read:\n\nThis aligns with guidance provided by Uefa's chief refereeing officer Roberto Rosetti in January 2023: \"We need the assistant referees to show their traditional abilities from the past. Accuracy, precision in offside evaluation. But timing is now an essential element of the job - they must know when to raise the flag.\n\n\"If they raise the flag at the wrong moment, problems can arise as far as the final decision is concerned. We've worked hard on the 'flag delay' concept.\"\n\nSimilar guidance has been in place in the Premier League since the start of the 2020-21 season, with former referee Chris Foy explaining: \"When an immediate goalscoring opportunity is likely to occur, the assistant referee will keep their flag down if they think there is an offside until the passage of play is completed.\n\n\"Once a goal is scored or the chance is gone, the assistant will raise the flag to indicate the initial offence. If a goal is scored, the VAR will review the offside call.\"\n\nWould Bayern have scored had the flag not been raised?\n\nWhile Bayern players and fans would probably maintain they would have scored had the referee decided to delay raising his flag, the reality is less clear.\n\nMarciniak blew his whistle as Thomas Muller headed the ball towards De Ligt, which appears to have distracted the Real Madrid defenders and goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, causing them to stop competing for the ball fractionally before the Dutchman takes the shot.\n\nIt is unclear whether he would have had such a simple shot on goal had the referee not blown his whistle to stop play at that point, which may well have resulted in his effort being blocked or saved.\n\nBut what is obvious is that the assistant referee should not have raised his flag as early as he did, even though VAR may have eventually agreed with his offside call.\n\nThe guidance and regulations clearly state he should have allowed play to continue in this goalscoring opportunity and then raised his flag once that phase of play had ended, whether that was with a goal or not.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Then we scored one and they have a disastrous decision from the linesman and from the referee.\n\n\"So, it feels almost like a betrayal in the end because of that decision. It was a huge fight, we left everything on the pitch and we were almost there. Now we have to say congratulations to Real Madrid.\n\n\"The linesman said sorry, but that does not help. At that kind of level, to raise the flag in a decision like this, a close decision, in the last minute and the referee as well.\n\n\"The referee does not have to whistle. He sees that we win the second ball, he sees that we get a shot away and to whistle is a very, very bad decision.\n\n\"And it is against the rules and it is a bad decision from both of them. It is a disaster. Tough to swallow, but that is the way it is.\"\n\nAn intriguing subplot was Kane up against compatriot Jude Bellingham, who produced an all-action display and helped set up a Wembley showdown with old club Borussia Dortmund on June 1.\n\nIt was a different story for Kane after this loss extended his wait for silverware, and Tuchel made the surprise decision to replace the former Tottenham forward in the 85th minute with Bayern leading.\n\nWhile Tuchel was not asked specifically about Kane being taken off, he said: \"Part of the story is we start with a front four and all four players need to go out because of injuries and cramps.\n\n\"It is a bit too much at that level.\"\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 9 May 2024, 6:35 AM Last updated: Thu 9 May 2024, 6:58 AM", "source": {"uri":

Their winning momentum was bolstered by a glaring error from Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer.\n\nAmidst the drama, Bayern managed to level the scoreline in stoppage time through Matthijs de Ligt. However, jubilation turned to dismay as the goal was disallowed due to Noussair Mazraoui being adjudged offside. With the assistant referee's flag halting play, VAR was unable to intervene, highlighting a procedural oversight. Consequently, the crucial goal was nullified, much to Bayern's chagrin.\n\nFollowing the match, beIN Sports revealed an angle indicating that Mazraoui was, in fact, onside during the build-up to de Ligt's goal. This revelation, circulated on X (formerly Twitter), suggests that the effort should have stood if play had been permitted to continue.\n\nThe aftermath left Bayern manager Tuchel visibly shaken, reportedly on the brink of tears. The controversial call loomed large in his post-match emotions, serving as the focal point of his frustration following their Champions League exit.\n\n\"This is a disaster, Toni's (Antonio Rudiger) leg is probably deeper than Mazraoui. It's an absolute disaster,\" the Bayern boss said in an interview with DAZN.\n\n\"Imagine if Real Madrid let them keep running when they score their second goal. It would have been the same, the ball goes to Toni and the whistle is blown. The situation must be played out to the end. That's the rule. Especially when she's so close to the gate. Especially when it's so tight,\" Tuchel added.\n\n\"The assistant makes the first mistake, the referee makes the second mistake. He doesn't have to whistle, he can just wait and see. That's what happened with the second goal. This is a violation of the rules,\" he added.\n\nOfficials are typically encouraged to hold off on making offside calls until the conclusion of the attacking phase, providing a chance to correct potential errors. However, the reasons for this standard not being adhered to in Madrid remain unclear.\n\nIn an interview with TNT Sports, Tuchel disclosed that the assistant referee had personally apologized to him for raising the flag prematurely in a sequence that could have altered the outcome of the game for his team.\n\n\"If it's offside, it's offside. But I think we made rules in football and the rules are if's not a clear offside - which it wasn't because I don't see it yet if it's offside or not - you have to keep playing. If you go in the last minutes and you whistle like this, I think it's a big mistake. If it's offside or not you can check it, but if you don't check it, how can you see it?\" Tuchel said.\n\n\"The second goal Rudiger is almost offside. If he whistles ok, but now there's a difference and this is a shame. The linesman said to me I'm sorry, I made a mistake, I can't buy anything for that. 'm not the type of person who wants to blame a loss or win on the referee but it means you have to win because you win 2-1. I think if it's a rule, it's a rule,\" the Bayern manager added.\n\nPaul Scholes weighed in on the controversy, suggesting that the linesman acted hastily in raising his flag. During his commentary on TNT Sports, Scholes remarked, \"I'm not sure it's offside. For the linesman to put his flag up... he's too hasty. He's got to wait.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Real Madrid will square off against Bayern's Bundesliga counterparts, Borussia Dortmund, in the upcoming Champions League final at Wembley Stadium next month.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noussair_Mazraoui", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noussair Mazraoui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Neuer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Bernab\u00e9u_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_R\u00fcdiger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antonio R\u00fcdiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeIN_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BeIN Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Scholes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Scholes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static-ai.asianetnews.com/images/01hxebd5xpf01ajegx27ekrj28/gettyimages-2152105543-594x594--1-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

It was Joselu who came off the bench for a brace, seeing the Spanish club advance 4-3 on aggregate, and they'll take on Dortmund in the final on June 1.\n\nBut it wasn't without massive controversy.\n\nAs Bayern pushed forward in need of an equalizer to force extra time, defender Matthijs de Ligt found the back of the net with a brilliantly struck low shot from inside of the box. The only problem? The assistant referee put his flag up and called offside on the long ball preceding the Dutch defender's shot. De Ligt and teammate Noussair Mazraoui went up for a long ball into the box and appeared onside. Instead of keeping his flag down and letting the play continue, the assistant referee called the offside, the ref whistled it, and the play was called dead. That meant that it could not be reviewed as Real Madrid players stopped playing before the shot went off.\n\nDe Ligt and Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel said the assistant referee apologized after the match with the coach calling it \"disastrous\" and \"like betrayal\" in an interview with TNT Sports.\n\nCBS Sports rule analyst Christina Unkel broke down the controversy on the Champions League Today Post-Match show and said there were multiple mistakes by the crew of Szymon Marciniak, Tomasz Listkiewicz and Adam Kupsik:\n\n\"Unfortunately, there are two officiating errors that occur here,\" Unkel said.\n\n\"Here, he [Mazraoui] is not in an offside position, so we don't even have to get into discussion about whether he interfered with play. But, we have the first error by the assistant referee in raising that flag, which goes against the direction of holding that flag, especially where the attacking phase of play and it has not yet finished. And then we have the second error by the referee in accepting that recommendation by the assistant referee and blowing his whistle instead of saying, 'Thank you, I see you. I'm going to hold my whistle until this play goes out.' And this is very surprising. This isn't some of the best in Europe, this actually would be considered the best [refereeing crew] in Europe. This Polish trio, having refereed Champions League final, having just done the men's World Cup final.

It was unclear whether a Munich player was indeed offside in the play, but the referee's decision to blow the whistle and not let play continue was nevertheless a significant mistake.\n\nThe decision incensed Munich players and coaches, as their nightmare season took another dismal turn when the final whistle blew to seal a 4-3 aggregate defeat.\n\n\"I don't want to say that it's always the referee's mistake with Real Madrid, but that made the difference today,\" said De Ligt.\n\nHe added to BeIN Sport: \"It's a big, big mistake, and a big disgrace... the linesman said to me 'I'm sorry. I made a mistake'.\"\n\nCoach Tuchel - who earned a yellow card earlier in the second half for protesting at the referee - was equally incensed, saying: \"It was a disaster. An absolute disaster and it's clear violation of the rules.\n\n\"The clear rule is that the scene must continue.

Mourinho 15 years ago but made just two appearances for the senior side.\n\nHe has subsequently gone on a journeyman career, including a failed stint at Stoke City, before earning a shock loan deal at Madrid this season from second division Espanyol.\n\n\"Joselu deserves it all, he has been an amazing squad member this season,\" Bellingham added.\n\nMadrid are into their 18th European Cup/Champions League final as they chase a record-extending 15th crown, while Coach Carlo Ancelotti is into a record sixth Champions League final, having only lost once before.\n\nBut for Bayern, it was an 11th

After the match, he told broadcaster DAZN the decision was \"a disaster, an absolute disaster\".\n\n\"We have to let the action play out until the end. That's the rule, especially since it's so close to the goal, and it's so limited.\n\n\"The first error is made by the linesman, the second comes from the referee,\" Tuchel said.\n\nThe 50-year-old coach told broadcaster TNT the decision \"felt like a betrayal\".\n\nSpeaking at the press conference, Tuchel said the referee apologised but added: \"It doesn't help to say sorry.\n\n\"Everyone has to go to their limit, everyone has to suffer, everyone has to play without making mistakes. So the referee has to be at that level too.\n\n\"It just doesn't help to make excuses after the fact.\n\n\"You are on the field for this reason, because you are the best there is. And we have the right to expect that until the end.\"\n\nThe goalscorer De Ligt agreed with his coach, calling the decision decisive in the match.\n\n\"The scene at the end, I find it incredible. I can't understand why he (the referee) doesn't let the action play out.\n\n\"He apologised. I wouldn't want to say that Real are always lucky, but that decision makes the difference today,\" De Ligt told DAZN.\n\nA disappointed Bayern captain Manuel Neuer said: \"We're in the Champions League semi-finals... I think he knows it was a mistake and that you shouldn't make a decision like that so quickly.\"", "source": {"uri": "vanguardngr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanguard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Musiala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Musiala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Maxim_Choupo-Moting", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAZN", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DAZN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Kimmich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Kimmich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Neuer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Neuer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Operations_Research", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Operations Research", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster_Relief_and_Recovery", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster Relief and Recovery", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-147.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "-02-01", "dateEnd": "2024-04-03", "textStart": 543, "textEnd": 554}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

A 4-3 aggregate victory sealed Real's progress to a remarkable sixth Champions League final in 10 years and they will bid for a record-extending 15th title against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on June 1.\n\nIn a repeat of their spectacular semi-final comeback win over Manchester City two years ago, they saw their opponents take the lead after Bayern substitute Alphonso Davies fired home a stunning strike from a counterattack in the 68th minute. But Joselu climbed off the bench to equalise following a calamitous error from Manuel Neuer in the 88th minute and, two minutes later, he shinned a second into the Bayern goal from a cross by Antonio Rudiger.\n\nThe effort was first ruled out for an apparent offside, but the goal was given following a VAR check. \"We've seen it a lot of times this season when it looked as though we're dead and buried ... it doesn't matter who scores the goals but someone always manages it... that mentality of never say die,\" Jude Bellingham, who will play against his former club in the final, told TNT Sports.\n\nReal dominated proceedings, but misfired on several chances as a gritty Bayern put their domestic woes aside to almost eliminate the Spaniards in their own back yard. Davies, who came off the bench early in the first half in place of injured Serge Gnabry, opened the scoring in spectacular fashion, cutting back on his right foot and curling an unstoppable bullet of a shot into the far corner on a counter-attack.\n\nNEUER FUMBLE\n\nBut Real, who were the better side throughout the game, piled on the pressure with Vinicius Jr tormenting the visitors down the left channel. The Brazilian glided past Matthijs De Ligt and Joshua Kimmich effortlessly and created a number chances for himself and his team mates, who were denied several times by an inspired Neuer.\n\nThe Bayern keeper looked on course to be man of the match as he weathered a storm, but with minutes remaining he fumbled a Vinicius strike from the edge of the box to gift Joselu the equaliser. The goal recharged a raucous Santiago Bernabeu under their spectacular new roof and two minutes later Real worked their European magic again, snatching a deserved winner that fired the Spanish giants into another final.\n\nBayern made a late push for an equaliser which they thought they had found when defender De Ligt rifled the ball home deep in added time. But play had already been stopped after the linesman flagged for a debatable offside in the build-up, leading Bayern's players and bench to complain vociferously to the referee and his assistants.\n\n\"We all know the rules and it's clear that, if it's not an obvious offside, you have to let it play.

Alphonso Davies' strike had the German team ahead but Joselu scored a quickfire late double to turn things around.\n\nThere was controversy, though, with a possible injury-time equaliser by Matthijs de Ligt not allowed. The Bayern defender rifled in, but referee Szymon Marciniak had already blown the whistle, following an offside flag from his assistant Tomasz Listkiewicz against Noussair Mazraoui, who had challenged Ferland Mendy for a header.\n\nThe offside call was extremely tight and officials are instructed to keep their flag down in such situations. That protocol was followed at the other end when Antonio Rudiger crossed for what turned out to be Joselu's winner - with the flag only going up after the ball hit the net, allowing VAR to check - but De Ligt did not get the same courtesy.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nBayern reacted furiously on the pitch at the time and after the final whistle and Thomas Tuchel said he felt \"betrayed\" by the call. De Ligt explained that Listkiewicz had apologised for the mistake, yet that admission had not helped cool the anger in the Bayern camp.\n\n\"There is nothing to explain. There is zero to explain. How many years has the VAR been around? For how many years has this offside rule been this way? This is already highly curious and dubious for me,\" Bayern's director of sport Eberl told reporters. \"He whistled, so no video assistant can intervene anymore because it was in front of the goal. The referee said it was his mistake. We can't buy s*** from that.\n\n\"Logically, this is a mistake. We all don't need [to check] the rules, we know exactly what it is. And if a situation is not yet finished, it is finished and then checked. Everyone was in favour [of an all-German final], only the Polish referees were not in favour, so I will keep my fingers crossed for BVB in the final.\"\n\nReferee Szymon Marciniak blew his whistle after seeing the offside flag\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! What did you make of the decision? Comment below.\n\nDe Ligt explained what happened in the aftermath of the mistake. \"The linesman said to me I'm sorry, I made a mistake, I can't buy anything for that,\" he said. \"I'm not the type of person who wants to blame a loss or win on the referee but it means you have to win because you win 2-1. I think if it's a rule, it's a rule.\"\n\nBayern forward Thomas Muller hinted that the officials may have been influenced by the partisan crowd inside the Bernabeu. \"He whistled for offside, that means the VAR could no longer intervene,\" he told RMC Sport. \"The referee didn't go to the VAR. He didn't even have the opportunity to go see it. A situation like this is very strange, blowing the whistle so quickly. It happens a lot here in Madrid... I saw it a few years ago, with two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo, but that was before VAR.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Matthijs de Ligt had the ball in the net, only to see the effort ruled out due to a controversial decision by the linesman to flag for offside. Two late Joselu goals sealed Real Madrid's place in the Champions League final against Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium.\n\nA rules expert has explained the controversial decision which saw Matthijs de Ligt's late goal disallowed in the Champions League semi-final between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, admitting several errors took place. The Spanish side progressed to the final - where they will meet Borussia Dortmund - after Joselu scored a quick-fire brace late in the game.\n\nThe tie was set up perfectly heading into the second leg, with the two European giants drawing 2-2 in the reverse fixture in Germany. The stage was set for the return clash at the Santiago Bernabeu, and the away side even took the lead against the run of play through an Alphonso Davies stunner. The left-back fired an effort into the far corner of the net with his weaker right foot to put the Germans in the driving seat.\n\nHowever, Manuel Neuer - who had been flawless until that point - would then spill the ball to the feet of Joselu in the 88th minute. The Newcastle United and Stoke City flop tucked the ball home before then adding his second of the game with a tap-in from Antonio Rudiger's cross just moments later. After a lengthy VAR check, the goal was awarded after initially being ruled out for offside.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Carlo Ancelotti has never lost as a manager against Bayern Munich in 10 games.\n\nThe controversy in the match came when the visitors launched a late attack in the hopes of finding an equaliser. De Ligt had the ball in the net, although the Dutchman was denied by the offside flag, which was raised before the attack played out fully. This was despite the fact the margin for error was extremely slim.\n\nRelated Real Madrid 2-1 Bayern Munich: Player Ratings and Match Highlights The side from Spain enjoyed a late double from Joselu to book a spot in the Champions League final once again. Rules Expert Explains Offside Decision Christina Unkel admitted two mistakes occurred\n\nCBS Sports spoke to a former FIFA referee-turned-rules expert, Christina Unkel about the incident. The analyst told the panel of Thierry Henry, Micah Richards and Jamie Carragher: \"Here, he [Mazraoui] is not in an offside position, so we don't even have to get into discussion about whether he interfered with play. But we have the first error by the assistant referee in raising that flag, which goes against the direction of holding that flag, especially where the attacking phase of play and it has not yet finished. Then we have the second error by the referee in accepting that recommendation by the assistant referee and blowing his whistle instead of saying, 'Thank you, I see you. I'm going to hold my whistle until this play goes out.'\"\n\nWhile acknowledging the error, Unkel admitted: \"This is very surprising. This isn't some of the best in Europe, this actually would be considered the best [refereeing crew] in Europe.\" She then continued to say it was a sad state of affairs, adding:\n\n\"It's never a good day when the discussion truly is about a clear, critical error by the refereeing crew.\"\n\nRelated Why Rodrygo is Wearing 'Pray For RS' Shirt in Real Madrid v Bayern Munich Rodrygo was seen wearing a shirt that said 'Pray for RS' under his Real Madrid kit in the Champions League semi-final - here's why. Bayern Munich's Champions League Dreams End Thomas Tuchel will bow out in a trophyless campaign\n\nBayern Munich thought they'd done enough to set up a final against fellow Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund when they took the lead in the Spanish capital. However, Thomas Tuchel's decision to substitute Harry Kane and Leroy Sane appeared detrimental as his team lost control from that point.\n\nThe German will depart at the end of the season without lifting any silverware this season, while Kane's wait for a major honour will continue beyond the club campaign. Tuchel and De Ligt claimed the linesman apologised for his error after the game, but this came too late to help the Bavarian outfit as they were already out of the competition.\n\nRelated The 15 best players in football history never to have won a trophy Harry Kane, Socrates, Matt Le Tissier and Antonio Di Natale are among the big names that never lifted silverware during their playing careers.",

It was a huge fight, we left everything on the pitch and we were almost there. Now we have to say congratulations to Real Madrid.\n\n\"The linesman said sorry, but that does not help. At that kind of level, to raise the flag in a decision like this, a close decision, in the last minute - and the referee as well.\n\n\"The referee does not have to whistle. He sees that we win the second ball, he sees that we get a shot away and to whistle is a very, very bad decision.\n\n\"And it is against the rules and it is a bad decision from both of them. It is a disaster. Tough to swallow, but that is the way it is.\"\n\nWhile there has been no clarification or comment from Uefa, the officials could point to the VAR protocols published by the International Football Association Board, which state that an assistant referee's offside flag should only be delayed \"in a very clear attacking situation when a player is about to score a goal or has a clear run into/towards the opponents' penalty area\".\n\nTwo goals from Joselu helped Real recover from a goal down to win 4-3 on aggregate. They will now go on to face Borussia Dortmund in the final at Wembley on June 1st.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Thu 9 May 2024, 9:58 AM Last updated: Thu 9 May 2024, 10:17 AM", "source": {"uri": "con-telegraph.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connaught Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymon_Marciniak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Szymon Marciniak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonso_Davies", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphonso Davies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Football_Association_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Football Association Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Six_Flags", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Six Flags", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cmg.infomaker.io/?uuid=8555d106-ef8b-56a8-a47d-86786a923468&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.99558&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2262, "textEnd": 2270}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

And tensions only continued to rise as replays showed the offside decision looked to an incredibly close call.\n\nIn this situation, VAR would normally intervene. However, as the referee blew his whistle before De Ligt scored, the play couldn't be reviewed.\n\nTuchel said after the game: \"We scored one and there was a disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee.

It was a disgraceful call,\" De Ligt said.\n\nWith Bayer Leverkusen ending Bayern's 11-year Bundesliga reign by securing the league title last month, the six-times European Cup winners had only one trophy left to fight for this season.\n\n\"We are almost through, it's almost there and there was a very unusual mistake from our best player for the equaliser then we conceded the second one in stoppage time,\" Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel said.\n\n\"Then we scored one and there was a disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee.

After Joselu had edged Bayern in front, there were still more than ten minutes of stoppage-time played, though the visitors were depleted in attack with Harry Kane, Leroy Sane and Jamal Musiala all brought off.\n\nKonrad Laimer was very nearly the hero in their absence, firing the ball into the net in the 103rd-minute, but the whistle had already gone after the linesman raised his flag for offside in the build-up. Replays showed it was very tight, with Antonio Rudiger potentially playing the Bayern players onside, but VAR could not intervene as the whistle was blown.\n\n\"A disastrous decision from the linesman and from the referee,\" Tuchel told TNT Sports when discussing the incident.\n\n\"It feels almost like a betrayal in the end because of that decision.

Muller was speaking about the disallowed Bayern goal that would have taken the match into extra time.\n\nThe German giants surrendered a one-goal lead to Madrid in the dying minutes of the game due to individual errors. However, during the press duties, Muller said the referees favoured the Spanish side, as they did in 2017\n\n\"Marciniak? He did not watch the video. He did not give himself the opportunity to look at it,\" said Muller, talking about the Polish referee.\n\n\"It's really strange, in such a situation, to whistle so fast. This often happens here in Madrid. \"I experienced this a few years ago, with two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo. But it was before the VAR,\" he added.\n\nThe incident Muller referred to occurred in the second leg of the UCL quarter-final tie in 2016-17 which saw Real Madrid beat Bayern 4-2 after extra-time to secure a 6-3 aggregate win.\n\nRonaldo scored twice in the added time, helping Madrid reach the next round. However, replays showed that both goals should have been chalked off due to offside. VAR had not been introduced in European competition at the time, so the on-field decisions were final.\n\nAlso read | Real Madrid stun Bayern Munich with late fightback to enter UEFA Champions League final\n\nBayern defender Matthijs de Ligt scored the contentious goal in the stoppage time but it was ruled out as the linesman had raised the offside flag. After the match, De Ligt claimed that the linesman apologised to him for disallowing the goal.\n\n\"The rule says that if it's not clear offside...you have to keep playing.\" De Ligt said. \"And if you go in the last minute and you whistle like this, I think this is a big mistake. If it's offside or not, I don't know, VAR can check it, but if you don't check it, how can you see it? This is a shame.\"\n\nThe offside on the De Ligt goal looked close to the naked eye but since the whistle was blown, VAR could not involve itself in the recheck process.\n\nThe Madrid win means the record UCL holders will have a shot at a 15th title when they square up against underdogs, Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium on June 1.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_M\u00fcller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas M\u00fcller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing_List_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Mailing List Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/2024/05/09/430376-copy-of-untitled-8.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 2371, "textEnd": 2377}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Bayern had to score but they were thwarted by the offside flag and the referee blew his whistle. Bayern lost 2-1 and were eliminated.\n\nBayern manager Thomas Tuchel was raging, calling it a \"a disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee.\"\n\nSo what happened, who was to blame, and how does this all work with VAR?\n\n- How VAR decisions have affected every Prem club in 2023-24\n\nThe ball was played into the Real Madrid area, with Noussair Mazraoui challenging Ferland Mendy. The Los Blancos defender headed the ball away, and as the ball dropped into open space in the area the assistant, Tomasz Listkiewicz, raised his flag. Referee Szymon Marciniak immediately blew the whistle.\n\nThomas M\u00fcller nodded the ball to Matthijs de Ligt, and he fired into net past Andriy Lunin -- though the goalkeeper made no attempt to make a save because of the whistle so you cannot say Bayern were denied a goal. The Real Madrid defenders may have been affected too.\n\nPlay stopped at the whistle so there was nothing the VAR could do, so this is all about how and when the play should end from a delayed flag.\n\nAs no goal was scored, there's no VAR offside situation to judged. So we won't get the semiautomated offside visualisation for this and we've never know for certain.\n\nBut it looks exceptionally close and Mazraoui may well have been marginally onside to the boot of Antonio R\u00fcdiger.\n\nMazraoui's act of challenging Mendy for the aerial ball is an offside offence even though he didn't touch it.\n\nAssistants are told to keep the flag down on close offsides, and only raise it when a goal is scored or at the end of the attacking move.\n\nIndeed, Real Madrid's winning goal in the 91st minute came through this route. Joselu scored from a pass by R\u00fcdiger and as soon as the ball crossed the line the flag went up; the goal was awarded through a VAR review as the striker was behind the ball. That Bayern lost to a delayed flag when they were denied by a premature flag only adds to their frustration.\n\nThe VAR Handbook states that the assistant \"should delay the flag if an attacking player has a 'free run' or is in a very good scoring position moving directly to, or within, the penalty area.\"\n\nFor Listkiewicz, Bayern never gained possession from the original pass. It's headed away by Mendy and the offside Mazraoui failed to continue the attack. Had Mazraoui collected the pass, or headed it to a teammate himself, the assistant may not have been so ready to raise the flag.\n\nTechnically no, but in a game of such magnitude and at such a crucial stage it would have made much more sense for Listkiewicz just to hold the flag for a little longer to see what developed.\n\nWe see so many delayed flag situations which seem to be completely needless -- for instance, when a player is running to the corner or is offside by a large margin.\n\nThis is a Champions League semifinal, one of the biggest games of the season. You've got VAR, so just wait a few more seconds.\n\nHowever, Listkiewicz's flag doesn't control the game.\n\nDoes the referee share any of the blame?\n\nAbsolutely, in fact he is in charge of when the game is halted so, ultimately, the buck stops with Marciniak. We will see a number examples across a season of an assistant raising the flag too early, and the referee takes the decision to hold the whistle just in case anything develops.\n\nSo regardless of the flag, Marciniak should not have stopped the play when the ball first fell to M\u00fcller. It should have been clear to him there was still an attacking situation.\n\nThe VAR Handbook says: \"If the assistant flags for a tight/unclear offside and a player is about to score a goal, the referee should delay the whistle until the goal results so that if the AR has made a 'clear and obvious error' the goal can be allowed.\"\n\nMarciniak's role is about allowing the attacking phase to complete, not to judge how close the offside may have been. This is on Marciniak.\n\nIt's not been a stellar season for Marciniak, who refereed the 2022 World Cup final and the 2023 Champions League final. Listkiewicz was also the assistant for both showpiece games.\n\nMarciniak was the referee who wrongly awarded a VAR-advised stoppage-time penalty to Paris Saint-Germain against Newcastle United in December, which was converted and effectively resulted in the Magpies being knocked out of Europe.\n\nThe delayed flag and the attacking phase (which the VAR can review) are two different considerations.\n\nIf the assistant has identified an offside, the flag should go up at the quickest point when there's no clear attacking momentum.\n\nHowever, if the assistant doesn't spot an offside the VAR can go back through the whole phase.", "source": {"uri": "espn.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noussair_Mazraoui", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noussair Mazraoui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferland_Mendy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ferland Mendy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Lunin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andriy Lunin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymon_Marciniak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Szymon Marciniak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_R\u00fcdiger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antonio R\u00fcdiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_M\u00fcller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas M\u00fcller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0509%2Fr1330499_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

He has given us so much, without ever losing confidence in what he's capable of.\"\n\nAncelotti, who will be aiming for a third Champions League title as a coach when Real face Borussia Dortmund at Wembley on June 1, dismissed his counterpart Thomas Tuchel's complaints about a late disallowed goal but struggled to explain Real's latest extraordinary comeback in this competition.\n\nTuchel was incensed at a refereeing error in the 103rd-minute which he felt denied his side an equaliser, calling the decision \"a betrayal\" and \"disastrous\". Matthijs de Ligt scored but the linesman's flag was up for an offside against against Noussair Mazraoui and the referee, Szymon Marciniak, had already blown his whistle before the ball went in, leading the Real defenders to appear to stop.\n\n\"If they can complain about that we can complain about the goal Nacho had disallowed,\" said Ancelotti, referencing Real's disallowed goal for a shove, shortly after Alphonso Davies had put Bayern in front.\n\n\"It happened again: it has happened other times and it's inexplicable. It's something magical. We played well, we had chances, and then we had the strength not to lose our heads when they scored. We have completed a season that few expected.\"\n\nTuchel, who substituted Harry Kane in the 85th-minute with Bayern leading 1-0, felt the defeat could be explained by the officials' errors and a \"very unusual\" blunder by goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who spilled Vinicius Jr's shot into Joselu's path for the equaliser.\n\n\"The linesman said sorry but that does not help,\" the Bayern Munich manager said. \"There are two mistakes.\n\n\"The first big mistake is from the linesman. He raised his flag straight away; to raise your flag in a situation like this, you have to be very, very sure it's offside.

Following Alphonso Davies' opening goal Tuchel proceeded to take off a host of his attacking stars.\n\nLeroy Sane, Jamal Musiala and Kane were all hauled off in the final stages. It meant, when Bayern went searching for an equaliser, they had many of their main attacking weapons sat on the bench. Ultimately they couldn't score the goal that would've forced extra-time.\n\nKane, in his debut season with the Bavarians, has scored 44 times, breaking numerous records en route. He couldn't influence matters in the final moments but Tuchel has no regrets over his tactical decisions.\n\nHe told TNT Sports: \"It hurts. It'll take a while to recover, but on the one hand it's a loss where we left it all out on the pitch. Of course, it's tough to accept. It's part of reality. No regrets. But on the other, there were too many injuries, a few too many substitutions, too many cramps.\n\n\"We started with a front four and by the end they were all off the pitch. And then Manu, who had been exceptional in saving us all night, made a mistake he wouldn't make in another 100 years.\"\n\nTuchel is expected to leave the Allianz Arena in the summer and will do so off the back of a rare trophyless season for the Munich outfit. The German though was left fuming when a late goal was ruled out as the linesman produced an early offside flag, with replays suggesting the Bayern players may have been onside.\n\nThe Bayern Munich marksman was bought off during the second-half\n\nThe ex-Chelsea boss said: \"We scored one, and it's a disastrous decision from the linesman and referee. It feels almost like a betrayal in the end because of that decision. The linesman said sorry - that does not help.

Bayern had to score but they were thwarted by the offside flag and the referee blew his whistle. Bayern lost 2-1 and were eliminated.\n\nBayern manager Thomas Tuchel was raging, calling it a \"a disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee.\"\n\nSo what happened, who was to blame, and how does this all work with VAR?\n\n- How VAR decisions have affected every Prem club in 2023-24\n\nWhat happened?\n\nThe ball was played into the Real Madrid area, with Noussair Mazraoui challenging Ferland Mendy. The Los Blancos defender headed the ball away, and as the ball dropped into open space in the area the assistant, Tomasz Listkiewicz, raised his flag, and referee Szymon Marciniak blew the whistle.\n\nThomas M\u00fcller nodded the ball to Matthijs de Ligt, and he fired into net past Andriy Lunin -- though the goalkeeper made no attempt to make a save because of the whistle so you cannot say Bayern were denied a goal. The Real Madrid players may have been affected too.\n\nPlay stopped at the whistle so there was nothing the VAR could do, so this is all about how and when the play stops from a delayed flag.\n\nWas Mazraoui onside?\n\nAs no goal was scored, there's no VAR offside situation to judged. So we won't get the semiautomated offside visualisation for this.\n\nBut it looks exceptionally close and Mazraoui may well have been marginally onside to the boot of Antonio R\u00fcdiger.\n\nMazraoui's act of challenging Mendy for the aerial ball is an offside offence even though he didn't touch it.\n\nWhy did the assistant raise his flag?\n\nAssistants are told to keep the flag down on close offsides, and only raise it when a goal is scored or at the end of the attacking move.\n\nIndeed, Real Madrid's winning goal in the 91st minute came through this route. Joselu scored from a pass by R\u00fcdiger and as soon as the ball crossed the line the flag went up; the goal was awarded through VAR review as the striker was behind the ball. That Bayern lost to a delayed flag when they were denied by a premature flag only adds to their frustration.\n\nThe VAR Handbook states that the assistant \"should delay the flag if an attacking player has a 'free run' or is in a very good scoring position moving directly to, or within, the penalty area.\"\n\nFor Listkiewicz, Bayern never gained possession from the original pass. It's headed away by Mendy and the offside Mazraoui failed to continue the attack. Had Mazraoui collected the pass, or headed it to a teammate, the assistant may not have been so ready to raise the flag.\n\nSo the assistant has done nothing wrong here?\n\nTechnically no, but in a game of such magnitude and at such a crucial stage it would have made much more sense for Listkiewicz just to hold the flag for a little longer to see what developed.\n\nWe see so many delayed flag situations which seem to be completely needless -- for instance, when a player is running to the corner or is offside by a large margin.\n\nThis is a Champions League semifinal, one of the biggest games of the season. You've got VAR, so just wait a few more seconds.\n\nHowever, Listkiewicz's flag doesn't control the game.\n\nDoes the referee share any of the blame?\n\nAbsolutely, in fact he is in charge of when the game stops so, ultimately, the buck stops with Marciniak. We will see a number examples across a season of an assistant raising the flag too early, and the referee takes the decision to hold the whistle just in case anything develops.\n\nSo regardless of the flag, Marciniak should not have stopped the play when the ball first fell to M\u00fcller. It should have been clear to him there was still an attacking situation.\n\nThe VAR Handbook says: \"If the assistant flags for a tight/unclear offside and a player is about to score a goal, the referee should delay the whistle until the goal results so that if the AR has made a 'clear and obvious error' the goal can be allowed.\"\n\nThis is on Marciniak.\n\nIt's not been a stellar season for Marciniak, who refereed the 2022 World Cup final and the 2023 Champions League final. Listkiewicz was also the assistant for both showpiece games.\n\nHe was the referee who wrongly awarded a VAR-advised stoppage-time penalty to Paris Saint-Germain against Newcastle United in December, which was converted and effectively resulted in the Magpies being knocked out of Europe.\n\nBut surely the attacking phase wasn't over?\n\nThe delayed flag and the attacking phase (which the VAR can review) are two different considerations.\n\nIf the assistant has identified an offside, the flag should go up at the quickest point when there's no clear attacking momentum.\n\nHowever, if the assistant doesn't spot an offside the VAR can go back through the whole phase.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noussair_Mazraoui", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noussair Mazraoui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferland_Mendy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ferland Mendy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Lunin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andriy Lunin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymon_Marciniak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Szymon Marciniak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_R\u00fcdiger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antonio R\u00fcdiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_M\u00fcller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas M\u00fcller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0509%2Fr1330499_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Bayern needed one goal to force extra time against Real Madrid.\n\nMatthijs de Ligt then shot into Madrid\u00b4s net that, if allowed, would have tied the score at 2-2 and kept Bayern in with a chance to reach the final.\n\nIn Marciniak's previous controversy, Newcastle coach Eddie Howe spoke of a \"poor decision ... hugely frustrating\" when Paris Saint-Germain converted a spot kick eight minutes into stoppage time to salvage a 1-1 draw at Parc des Princes.\n\nBayern's Thomas Mueller, centre, reacts with referee during the Champions League semifinal second leg soccer match between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid, Spain, Wednesday, May 8, 2024. (AP Photo/Jose Breton)\n\nA win would have lifted Newcastle above PSG into second place in the group standings, behind leader Borussia Dortmund, with one round left. PSG ultimately advanced to the semifinals and was eliminated this week by Dortmund.\n\nMarciniak awarded the penalty for handball against Newcastle defender Tino Livramento only after being urged by his video review specialist to look at the pitchside monitor. That official, Tomasz Kwiatkowski, was stood down by UEFA from his subsequent Champions League game.\n\nKwiatkowski also was on duty on Wednesday in Madrid but never got a chance to advise on the marginal offside call against Bayern because Marciniak whistled to officially stop play before De Ligt could shoot.\n\n\"It feels almost like a betrayal in the end because of that decision,\" Tuchel said. \"The referee does not have to whistle. He sees that we win the second ball, he sees that we get the shot away. To whistle is a very, very bad decision. It\u00b4s against the rules and it\u00b4s a bad decision from both of them.\n\n\"The linesman said sorry. That does not help.\"\n\nDe Ligt said the assistant apologized to him, saying, \"I\u00b4m sorry, I made a mistake.\"\n\n\"If it\u00b4s offside or not, I don\u00b4t know, VAR can check it,\" the Bayern defender said. \"But if you don\u00b4t check it, how can you see it? This is a shame.\"\n\nUEFA did not comment on Thursday in line with its policy on field-of-play rulings.\n\nIn November, Marciniak\u00b4s video review specialist was removed from duty when UEFA\u00b4s chief of football was Zvonimir Boban, the Croatia great who won a Champions League with AC Milan. Boban left UEFA in January in a dispute with its president Aleksander Ceferin about governance standards.\n\nMarciniak and his team were already out of contention for handling the Champions League final on June 1 - when Madrid plays Dortmund at Wembley Stadium in London - because they officiated the showpiece game last year. They were widely praised for handling Manchester City\u00b4s 1-0 win over Inter Milan, and their work at the World Cup final in Qatar.\n\nControversy flared days before that Champions League final when Marciniak spoke at a business rally in Poland run by a far-right politician.\n\nUnder pressure from a Polish anti-discrimination group that works in soccer, and later UEFA, Marciniak made a statement to \"express my deepest apologies\" for being involved in the event. He said he was misled about its true nature.\n\n\"I humbly request an opportunity to make amends and regain your trust through my future actions,\" the referee said last June.\n\nStill recognized as among the world\u00b4s best, Marciniak will return to UEFA duty at the European Championship, where Bayern\u00b4s stadium is one of 10 venues for the June 14-July 14 tournament.\n\nIt will be a surprise if UEFA sends Marciniak and his team to work in Munich so soon.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer\n\nBayern's Thomas Mueller reacts during the Champions League semifinal second leg soccer match between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid, Spain, Wednesday, May 8, 2024.

Against the ropes. Sinking in quicksand. Cornered by the result and the stopwatch. When everything seems lost, Madrid is in its element. Others would throw in the towel. The whites and the Bernab\u00e9u always find a way out, an extra life, an unexpected hero. Madrid has a pact with the devil, with the football scriptwriter or with the myth of the European Cup itself.\n\nIt doesn't matter that Neuer was playing a great game or that Kane was close to 0-2. It doesn't matter that Joselu had only scored one goal since February 18. All of this collided in the 88th minute. Vin\u00edcius' shot bounced in front of the German goalkeeper and escaped him. That's where Joselu came in, who went ahead of Dier to tie the game. \"It was a mistake by our best player, who had saved us during the game,\" Tuchel lamented about his captain.\n\nHis rivals have a complex of the coyote from the Road Runner cartoons. No matter how carefully the plan is studied, even if they have done everything almost perfectly, no matter how close you are to falling into the trap, no matter how much the episode is about to end and you have success in your hand, there is still time for the illogical, to escape. There is always a loophole.\n\nIn Manchester, R\u00fcdiger scored the decisive penalty of the shoot-out. This time the German center back put in the cross for Joselu to score the second in the 91st minute, four minutes after 1-1. Anyone would have thought about the extension. But Madrid is nonconformity. \"What never happens has happened again,\" Ancelotti summarized.\n\nThe forward, who belongs to Espanyol and had never played in the Champions League until this season, put Madrid at Wembley with a double. The whites paid half a million for his loan. And the Galician, born in Stuttgart, has rewarded them with 17 goals at the age of 34.\n\n\"It's a very bad night. We had it very close. But when you think Madrid is dead, he always has one last breath. That's why they have won the Champions League 14 times,\" De Ligt stated after Bayern lost his last option in stoppage time due to a referee error.\n\nMarciniak whistled when what is recommended to the referees is to wait, to let the play finish. Despite this advice, the tribune band assistant raised the flag in a dubious move. And the Pole whistled before M\u00fcller assisted De Ligt. When the Dutchman beat Lunin the play was cancelled. The referee was hasty because the replays say that the offside was not clear at all, but the lines were no longer thrown because the action was invalidated.\n\nThat outraged Bayern, who couldn't believe it, who didn't understand the rush to blow the whistle. Tuchel protested. Goretzka on the bench pointed threateningly at the lineman. M\u00fcller was furious. But nothing could be done now. \"We all know the rules. When the offside is not clear, you have to let the game play. He did it this way with Joselu's goal, which was another tight play and could be reviewed. However, not with ours. It is a shame. The assistant has asked me for forgiveness,\" De Ligt revealed. \"We have been denied a tie. The referees here feel anxiety,\" said Tuchel.

It may be difficult for Marciniak to manage key matches on the Old Continent. This is record news, but also bad news ahead of Euro 2024\n\nSimon Marciniak and his team had a perfect win in their Champions League semi-final, but the situation overshadowed everything in the 13th minute of extra time. Matthias de Ligt then scored a goal to make the score 2-2, which would have given Bayern Munich extra time, but the Polish referees blew their whistle for offside in this case.\n\nThe problem is that they did it while the procedure was still ongoing. For this reason, VAR was unable to check this action and definitively assess whether Bayern players were offside, which was determined in millimetres.\n\nThe instructions are clear: in such situations, you must wait until the end of the procedure to raise the flag and blow the whistle to check it. The mere raising of the flag by the lineman meant nothing, because Marciniak could have ignored that hint and waited. But when he blew the whistle just before the shot and the ball went into the goal, the option to check the situation definitely disappeared. This is exactly what is wrong in this case.\n\nWhether he was actually a hacker or not is a separate matter. The Germans are feeling angry at the present time, and Bayern Munich coach Thomas Tuchel has not yet accepted the apology of the Polish team, which admitted its mistake (according to the words of Bayern Munich representatives).\n\nChristina Unkel broke down the whole situation on CBS Sports.\n\n- I don't agree with Jamie Carragher that it was just a mistake by the line referee. Unfortunately, in this case there were two refereeing errors. Mazraoui was not in an offside position, so we don't even need to talk about whether he affected the match or not. But the first mistake was when the linesman raised his flag. This is contrary to the recommendations to rush to lift it, especially since the offensive work is not over yet - the former FIFA referee began her statement.\n\nThen she pointed out the second mistake. -- The referee accepted this recommendation and blew the offside whistle instead of saying, \"Thank you, I see you, but I will wait until the end of the procedure to blow the referee's whistle.\" This is very surprising. This is not one of the best refereeing teams in Europe, it is considered the best in Europe. This Polish team has just managed a Champions League final and a World Cup final. The linesman and referee's decision was surprising. It wasn't a good day for them.\n\n- It is never a good idea to talk about an obvious refereeing error. These are fundamental decisions that change the fate of the match... Neither the refereeing team nor the entire refereeing community will be satisfied with them. Especially when we have so much technology at our disposal that can help us avoid these kind of mistakes.\n\nIn addition, Onkel pointed out another mistake committed by Marciniak: Joselu's goal was initially disallowed at 2-1 in the 91st minute for offside (here Adam Kubcic raised his flag), but in this case the VAR intervened and the goal was conceded.\n\nIn addition, in one of Real Madrid's dangerous situations, there were two balls on the field, one of them confused some players, so Marciniak had to stop the match.\n\nUnkel also spoke about the potential consequences for Marciniak and his team. It may be difficult for them to get the next most important matches in the world and this is standard practice in such situations. The American is even more surprised, as she has confirmed several times, as Polish judges are considered among the best, if not the best, in the world.\n\nThis is even more bad news ahead of Euro 2024. Marciniak was to referee the prestigious opening match between Germany and Scotland (June 14). It is not known whether this error will affect whether he will officiate this match, although after the Champions League semi-final match on Wednesday, the chances of him being able to officiate the Euro 2024 semi-final match, for example, It may decline is unlikely, though not because it is so weak. On the contrary, because he fell victim to his own success!\n\n-- Simon Marciniak has already refereed three Grand Finals, and now is definitely the time to give the other judges credit. But the opening match is a completely different matter. This is a great prestige and a great responsibility. The opening match referee must set an example for other referees in how to referee throughout the tournament and how to interpret different situations. Such a match must be led by someone who ensures the highest level. Rafael Rostkowski, a former international referee, said it is difficult to name a better candidate than the Pole.", "source": {"uri": "moviesonline.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoviesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kayla_nunez@moviesonline.ca", "name": "Kayla Nunez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noussair_Mazraoui", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noussair Mazraoui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_International_Referees_List", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA International Referees List"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Carragher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Carragher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ocdn.eu/sport-images-transforms/1/nO1k9lBaHR0cHM6Ly9vY2RuLmV1L3B1bHNjbXMvTURBXy9hMDA5OGZiMDhkNThlOWI5MDMwYWFmMzVlN2FkNTc2OS5qcGeTlQPNBgTNAlPNCnjNBeSTBc0EsM0CdJMJpmQ0MWQ4YwbeAAKhMAGhMQE", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551379", "eventUri": "eng-9551379", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 3818, "textEnd": 3825}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Alphonso Davies curled in a stunning opener to put Bayern ahead before Joselu came off the bench to score twice in three minutes to seal the comeback.\n\nBut there was controversy at the end after the linesman's flag denied Bayern what could have been an equaliser. Matthijs de Ligt rifled in but only after Szymon Marciniak's whistle had been blown, despite the rules stating that officials should let play continue in such situations.\n\nThomas Tuchel said he felt \"betrayed\" by the call, while De Ligt, Thomas Muller and Bayern director of sport Max Eberl all voiced their anger. Former Arsenal striker Henry was on the CBS Sports panel for the post-match discussion, which he took in a very different direction.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS!Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nAsked if he understood Bayern's frustration, Henry replied: \"One million per cent. My view of it at the time wasn't so much on the linesman, because I've seen it before. I've seen linesmen doing that (putting their flag up), but the big man (referee) takes the decision, always him, he is the chief. Why did you blow your whistle? Just let it go. You have something that can tell you if there's an offside or not. Christina [Unkel, CBS' rules analyst] has said it already: massive, just like in Pretty Woman, huge mistake, huge.\"\n\nFor those not familiar with the 1990 romantic comedy Pretty Woman, Henry was referring to a scene in which Julia Roberts' character berates a sales assistant in a clothes shop, describing her behaviour as a \"big mistake, huge\". The reference was not lost on Abdo, but it flew over the heads of fellow pundits Jamie Carragher and Micah Richards.\n\nAfter an awkward pause, Carragher gamely tried to continue the football chat with: \"No, it is a massive mistake. What Christina said about officials at this level - you know they are going to be the best - but to explain that these are actually seen as the best...\"\n\nThierry Henry is a big Julia Roberts fan clearly\n\nBut Abdo could not hold it together, bursting out laughing before saying: \"Sorry, I'm so thrown by you quoting Pretty Woman...\" Henry added: \"A 'huge mistake', the bags, you remember? You don't know? OK, let's go back.\" Carragher admitted: \"You've thrown me a bit there.\"\n\nThe tone of the chat was a long way from the tone of the backlash from those of a Bayern persuasion. \"There was a disastrous decision from the linesman and the referee,\" Tuchel said. \"It feels like a betrayal in the end. There was a huge fight, we left everything on the pitch and we were almost there. Now we say congratulations to Real Madrid. The linesman says sorry but that does not help.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Bayern needed one goal to force extra time against Real Madrid.\n\nMatthijs de Ligt then shot into Madrid's net that, if allowed, would have tied the score at 2-2 and kept Bayern in with a chance to reach the final.\n\nIn Marciniak's previous controversy, Newcastle coach Eddie Howe spoke of a \"poor decision ... hugely frustrating\" when Paris Saint-Germain converted a spot kick eight minutes into stoppage time to salvage a 1-1 draw at Parc des Princes.\n\nA win would have lifted Newcastle above PSG into second place in the group standings, behind leader Borussia Dortmund, with one round left. PSG ultimately advanced to the semifinals and was eliminated this week by Dortmund.\n\nMarciniak awarded the penalty for handball against Newcastle defender Tino Livramento only after being urged by his video review specialist to look at the pitchside monitor. That official, Tomasz Kwiatkowski, was stood down by UEFA from his subsequent Champions League game.\n\nKwiatkowski also was on duty on Wednesday in Madrid but never got a chance to advise on the marginal offside call against Bayern because Marciniak whistled to officially stop play before De Ligt could shoot.\n\n\"It feels almost like a betrayal in the end because of that decision,\" Tuchel said. \"The referee does not have to whistle. He sees that we win the second ball, he sees that we get the shot away. To whistle is a very, very bad decision. It's against the rules and it's a bad decision from both of them.\n\n\"The linesman said sorry. That does not help.\"\n\nDe Ligt said the assistant apologized to him, saying, \"I'm sorry, I made a mistake.\"\n\n\"If it's offside or not, I don't know, VAR can check it,\" the Bayern defender said. \"But if you don't check it, how can you see it? This is a shame.\"\n\nUEFA did not comment on Thursday in line with its policy on field-of-play rulings.\n\nIn November, Marciniak's video review specialist was removed from duty when UEFA's chief of football was Zvonimir Boban, the Croatia great who won a Champions League with AC Milan. Boban left UEFA in January in a dispute with its president Aleksander \u010ceferin about governance standards.\n\nMarciniak and his team were already out of contention for handling the Champions League final on June 1 -- when Madrid plays Dortmund at Wembley Stadium in London -- because they officiated the showpiece game last year. They were widely praised for handling Manchester City's 1-0 win over Inter Milan, and their work at the World Cup final in Qatar.\n\nControversy flared days before that Champions League final when Marciniak spoke at a business rally in Poland run by a far-right politician.\n\nUnder pressure from a Polish anti-discrimination group that works in soccer, and later UEFA, Marciniak made a statement to \"express my deepest apologies\" for being involved in the event. He said he was misled about its true nature.\n\n\"I humbly request an opportunity to make amends and regain your trust through my future actions,\" the referee said last June.\n\nStill recognized as among the world's best, Marciniak will return to UEFA duty at the European Championship, where Bayern's stadium is one of 10 venues for the June 14-July 14 tournament.\n\nIt will be a surprise if UEFA sends Marciniak and his team to work in Munich so soon.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "graham_dunbar@hjnews.com", "name": "Graham Dunbar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Handball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymon_Marciniak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Szymon Marciniak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvonimir_Boban", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zvonimir Boban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parc_des_Princes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parc des Princes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksander_\u010ceferin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aleksander \u010ceferin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assistant referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

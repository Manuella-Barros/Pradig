If it passes 2,500, if it's 2,501, then we automatically close the border. Fire marshall says \u2018No more!\u2019 He's gonna come here and close the club! And if you don't have a stamp on your hand, you can't get back in!\" JEN PSAKI ADMITS BIDEN'S BORDER EXECUTIVE ORDER MEANT TO ADDRESS \u2018POLITICAL VULNERABILITY\u2019 AHEAD OF ELECTION \"But when it goes down to 1,500, then we resume standard asylum procedures. It's like surge-pricing with Uber,\" Maher quipped. \"It's a bizarre scheme that of course has pleased nobody. It looks like a last minute- it looks like he did nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. Then of course, he did try through Congress and the Republicans purposely spiked that football. They didn't want this bill because they wanted it as an issue. So they could have fixed it themselves. They didn't. But now it looks like this is his last minute before-the-election Hail Mary pass, and it's not gonna succeed.\" BILL MAHER STRUGGLES WHETHER TRUMP SHOULD GO TO JAIL FOLLOWING GUILTY VERDICT: \u2018MAGA NATION WILL GO NUTS\u2019 The HBO star then cited a stat showing that since Biden took office in January 2021, \"more than 9 million migrants have entered.\" \"That's more than the number of people who live in Nicaragua. He let in all of Nicaragua,\" Maher said. He continued, \"The question that Democrats don't seem to be able to have the balls to answer is just how many is too many? And like, infinity is the answer- if you don't give that answer, you're a racist. That's their essential problem with this issue.\" BILL MAHER REVIVES PUSH TO REMOVE BIDEN FROM TICKET: ONLY DEBATING TRUMP BECAUSE HE \u2018KNOWS HE\u2019S LOSING' Maher later shared \"eye-popping numbers\" showing former President Trump with a \"30-point edge\" over Biden with registered voters on who can handle immigration and border security better. \"This is even after he promised us the wall and didn't- that was his big issue and never delivered!\" Maher explained.

Back in Oct. 2021, he called the border crisis the \"Achilles' heel\" for the the party come election time.", "summary": "HBO&apos;s Bill Maher panned President Biden&apos;s executive order on combatting the border crisis, insisting it&apos;s a pre-election &quot;Hail Mary&quot; that won&apos;t win over voters.", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/media/bill-maher-pans-bidens-border-pivot-pre-election-hail-mary-wont-work", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/08/931/523/Maher-Biden.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:56:41", "author": "Joseph Wulfsohn", "authors": ["Joseph Wulfsohn"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.716}

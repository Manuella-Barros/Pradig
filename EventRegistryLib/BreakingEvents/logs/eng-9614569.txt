China and other issues related to workers' rights and its extensive supply chain.\n\nIf it does list in London, Shein is expected to seek to raise more than \u00a31 billion through the sale of new shares to investors.\n\nThis would, however, be relatively modest in the context of an anticipated valuation of \u00a350 billion or more.\n\nThe company was valued at $66 billion in its latest funding round early last year.\n\nLast month, Sky News revealed that Sajid Javid, the former Chancellor of the Exchequer, was approached to play a role at Shein.\n\nIf talks continue, they could see him either join Shein's board or become an advisor to the China-founded company.\n\nShein could be responsible for organizing the second-largest IPO in the history of the London Stock Exchange, behind the 2011 debut of Glencore International, the commodities trading and mining group.\n\nGoldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are advising on the transaction.\n\nLearn more about the

worldwide.\n\nThe LSE's efforts to woo Shein come at a difficult time for the City as a listing venue for large multinationals, with ARM Holdings, the UK-based chip designer, choosing to list in New York instead. than in London.\n\nOther companies, such as gambling operator Flutter Entertainment and tour operator TUI, have moved their listings out of London, citing higher valuations and more liquid markets.\n\nHowever, in recent weeks London has landed potential IPOs for Raspberry Pi, the personal computer maker, giving the City a boost.\n\nLast month, Mr Hunt held summit in Dorneywood in the presence of technology companies such as Raspberry Pi and Monzo, the digital bank valued at more than \u00a34 billion, as part of efforts to encourage them to list in the UK.", "source": {"uri":

Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley piled in as lead underwriters. Donald Tang, Shein's Los Angeles-based executive chairman, moved to Washington to lead the company's lobbying blitz.\n\nBut Shein's charm offensive ran headlong into a wall of resistance. Politicians from both parties called for investigations into working conditions at the thousands of Chinese factories to which Shein subcontracts and demanded more information about where the company sources cotton. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has increased scrutiny of low-value packages sent from overseas directly to U.S. consumers under the \"de minimis\" provision, which exempts these shipments from tariffs and other trade rules. Customs officials escalated the crackdown by suspending several brokers from participating in a program that expedites such shipments.\n\nShein hasn't withdrawn its U.S. IPO application. But the SEC hasn't advanced it. And so, early this year, Shein shifted the focus of its listing bid to London.\n\nShein will get a warmer welcome there. The London Stock Exchange has been losing listings to New York post-Brexit, and U.K. finance officials fear their bourse has too few fast-growing tech companies. The LSE raised a meager $1 billion last year, the lowest level in decades, according to Bloomberg. By comparison, IPOs on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange raised a total of $24.1 billion last year.\n\nIn its latest private fundraising, Shein had a valuation of $66 billion; some analysts think an LSE offering could rake in $5 billion to $10 billion, which could make it the second-largest in the exchange's history. Britain's Sky News reports that the U.K. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt met recently with Tang to show his support.\n\nShein must also win over regulators in Beijing. The company moved its headquarters from Nanjing to Singapore in 2022 and doesn't sell to customers in China. But Shein's thousands of suppliers are based mainly in China, so the company needs to seek approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission for an offshore listing.\n\nPerhaps the greater long-run threat to Shein's continued growth is falling out of fashion with global customers. Saturday Night Live last week skewered the willful obliviousness of supposedly woke fast fashion shoppers in a parody ad for a Shein- and Temu-like company called \"Xiemu.\"\n\nThe parody ad's snarky tagline: \"Don't worry about it!\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This milestone would be the clearest sign yet that Shein, owner of British fashion brand Missguided, is set to stage London's most high-profile public listing in over a decade.\n\nWhile the prospectus filing timing doesn't necessarily indicate when an IPO would occur, some observers believe a summer or early autumn market debut remains possible. Shein had originally targeted a New York listing but faced political opposition, leading it to pivot towards London.\n\nThe Sky News report noted that Shein executive chairman Donald Tang met Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and other ministers earlier this year, underlining UK officials' eagerness to secure the blockbuster float over American rivals.\n\nIf it proceeds with a London IPO, Shein is expected to raise over \u00a31 billion from the sale of new shares, albeit modest compared to the anticipated \u00a350 billion-plus valuation. The company was valued at $66 billion in early 2022.\n\nHowever, Shein has courted controversy over its use of cotton from China's Xinjiang region and other labour rights issues across its vast supply chain. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are advising on the potential mega-listing.\n\nSenior British lawmakers, including the chairs of three parliamentary committees, have also raised questions about fast-fashion giant Shein's suitability for a London stock market listing and called for greater scrutiny of the Chinese-founded firm.\n\nLast month, Alicia Kearns, the Conservative chair of parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, said Shein should not be permitted to list in London, saying: \"With Shein's prices so low, the London Stock Exchange needs to ask itself, whose suffering is subsidising those prices.\"\n\nSarah Champion, the Labour chair of the International Development Committee, expressed similar concerns about Shein's labour practices. \"No company using modern slavery should be listed in London. Unless the allegations around Shein are addressed, we should not support their application,\" she said.\n\nFounded in 2012, Shein boasts 150 million users across over 150 countries. Its mooted valuation would significantly exceed apparel giants like H&M and Inditex, the owner of Zara.", "source": {"uri": "retail-systems.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "retail-systems.com"},

observers believe a summer or early autumn stock market debut in London remains on the cards.\n\nShein had initially targeted a New York listing but has been beset by political opposition which has resulted in a lukewarm reception from regulators.\n\nBy contrast, Sky News revealed earlier this year that Donald Tang, Shein's executive chairman, had met Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, earlier this year, alongside other ministers and executives from the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe meeting between Mr Hunt and Mr Tang underlined the importance that British officials are attaching to the idea of trumping the US in an effort to land the Shein IPO.\n\nMr Tang is also understood to have spoken to a number of frontbench Labour politicians, including Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary in recent months.\n\nThe filing of a prospectus with the FCA does not guarantee that the company will list in London, with a final decision subject to meetings with fund managers and the approval of listing authorities in the UK.\n\nHowever, people close to the process said it represented a significant moment that meant a City float for Shein was now highly likely.\n\nShein has been at the centre of controversy over its use of cotton from the Xinjiang region of China and other issues related to workers' rights and its vast supply chain.\n\nIf it does proceed with a London listing, Shein is expected to seek to raise over \u00a31bn from the sale of new shares to investors.\n\nThis would, however, be relatively modest in the context of an anticipated valuation of \u00a350bn or more.\n\nThe company was valued at $66bn in its last funding round early last year.\n\nLast month, Sky News revealed that Sajid Javid, the former chancellor of the exchequer, has been approached about taking a role at Shein.\n\nIf the discussions proceed, they could see him either join Shein's board or become an adviser to the Chinese-founded company.\n\nShein could be responsible for staging the London Stock Exchange's second-largest IPO in history, behind the 2011 stock market debut of Glencore International, the commodities trading and mining group.\n\nGoldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are advising on the deal.\n\nRead more from business:\n\nOfwat hits Thames Water with \u00a340m fine\n\nSuperdry wins reprieve as M&G drops challenge\n\nFancy dress brand

more than 150 countries and boasts 150m users globally.\n\nThe LSE's efforts to court Shein come during a challenging period for the City as a listing venue for large multinationals, with ARM Holdings, the UK-based chip designer, opting to float in New York rather than London.\n\nOther companies, such as the gambling operator Flutter Entertainment and tour operator TUI, have shifted their listings away from London, citing higher valuations and more liquid markets.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, London has landed the prospective IPOs of Raspberry Pi, the personal computer maker, delivering a boost to the City.\n\nLast month, Mr Hunt hosted a summit at Dorneywood attended by technology companies such as Raspberry Pi and Monzo, the digital bank valued at over \u00a34bn, as part of efforts to encourage them to list in the UK.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley piled in as lead underwriters. Donald Tang, Shein's Los Angeles-based executive chairman, moved to Washington to lead the company's lobbying blitz.\n\nBut Shein's charm offensive ran headlong into a wall of resistance. Politicians from both parties called for investigations into working conditions at the thousands of Chinese factories to which Shein subcontracts and demanded more information about where the company sources cotton. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has increased scrutiny of low-value packages sent from overseas directly to U.S. consumers under the \"de minimis\" provision, which exempts these shipments from tariffs and other trade rules. Customs officials escalated the crackdown by suspending several brokers from participating in a program that expedites such shipments.\n\nShein hasn't withdrawn its U.S. IPO application. But the SEC hasn't advanced it. And so, early this year, Shein shifted the focus of its listing bid to London.\n\nShein will get a warmer welcome there. The London Stock Exchange has been losing listings to New York post-Brexit, and U.K. finance officials fear their bourse has too few fast-growing tech companies. The LSE raised a meager $1 billion last year, the lowest level in decades, according to Bloomberg. By comparison, IPOs on the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange raised a total of $24.1 billion last year.\n\nIn its latest private fundraising, Shein had a valuation of $66 billion; some analysts think an LSE offering could rake in $5 billion to $10 billion, which could make it the second-largest in the exchange's history. Britain's Sky News reports that the U.K. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt met recently with Tang to show his support.\n\nShein must also win over regulators in Beijing. The company moved its headquarters from Nanjing to Singapore in 2022 and doesn't sell to customers in China. But Shein's thousands of suppliers are based mainly in China, so the company needs to seek approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission for an offshore listing.\n\nPerhaps the greater long-run threat to Shein's continued growth is falling out of fashion with global customers. Saturday Night Live last week skewered the willful obliviousness of supposedly woke fast fashion shoppers in a parody ad for a Shein- and Temu-like company called \"Xiemu.\"\n\nThe parody ad's snarky tagline: \"Don't worry about it!\"\n\nChina will restrict exports of some aviation and aerospace equipment starting July 1. Companies will need to get an export license if they wish to sell these products outside of the country. Both the U.S. and China are imposing new export restrictions as a way to limit the sale and transfer of strategic products and commodities. The Associated Press\n\nSalesforce slips\n\nShares in Salesforce dropped almost 20% on Thursday after the software company forecast just 8% growth in sales in the current quarter. That would mark the first quarter of single-digit sales growth in its two decades as a public company.

Shein's decision to opt for London comes after an initial effort to float in New York was derailed when politicians and regulators raised concerns about tensions between Beijing and Washington.\n\nIn the UK, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, met Donald Tang, Shein's executive chair earlier this year to try to persuade Shein to list in the UK rather than New York.\n\nOn Monday, the Times reported that Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, Sarah Jones, the shadow minister for industry, and Chris Bryant, the shadow minister for creative industries, had recently met Tang to discuss listing.\n\nSources told the paper that should Labour come to power in July, it would be very supportive of Shein floating in the UK.\n\nThe company, which was launched in Nanjing, China, in 2012, has rapidly become one of the world's largest fashion retailers because of its low prices and high-volume sales.\n\nIt is headquartered in Singapore and, while most of its suppliers are based in China, it does not sell products to the country.\n\nThe company posted more than $2bn of profits in 2023, nearly double the $1.1bn in 2021. If listed in the UK it is understood that it could be valued at \u00a350bn.\n\nThe expected filing of a prospectus does not guarantee that the company will list in the UK but people close to the process told Sky News - which first reported the impending filing - said it represented a significant moment that meant a City float for Shein was very likely.\n\nHowever, senior politicians, including three parliamentary committee chairs, have questioned efforts to woo Shein, raising concerns about labour conditions in its supply chains.\n\nShein responded to the comments by saying it took visibility across its supply chain seriously, had zero-tolerance to forced labour and was committed to human rights.\n\nIf Shein does list in the UK it would be a significant boost in what has been a gloomy period for the LSE, with a number of high-profile companies leaving the UK for listings elsewhere.\n\nLast month, the Paddy Power owner Flutter confirmed that it was moving its listing from London to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to persuade it to float in the UK.\n\nEarlier this year, the Anglo-German travel company Tui voted to abandon the London Stock Exchange in favour of listing its shares solely in Germany. However, there was some good news last month, when the UK-based tech firm Raspberry Pi confirmed its intention to float in the UK.\n\nThe listing would eclipse the biggest listing seen on the LSE - the commodities company Glencore's \u00a338bn float in 2011 - and the spin-out of GSK's consumer goods arm as Haleon, at \u00a330.5bn in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

\u00a350bn London float", "body": "Shein, which was valued at $66bn in its last fundraising, will file a confidential prospectus with the City regulator this month as it nears a blockbuster City listing, Sky News learns.\n\nShein, the online fashion behemoth, is on the verge of taking a huge stride towards a London flotation that would value it at about \u00a350bn and rank among the most significant - and contentious - deals in the UK's capital markets for years.\n\nSky News can exclusively reveal that Shein, which was founded in China but is headquartered in Singapore, is preparing to file a prospectus with the Financial Conduct Authority for approval ahead of its potential float.\n\nCity sources said on Sunday evening that the confidential filing could take place as soon as the coming week, although it could yet take place later this month.\n\nThe milestone in the listing process would be the clearest sign so far that Shein, which owns the British fashion brand Missguided, is to become London's most high-profile public float for more than a decade.\n\nThe timing of the filing does not necessarily indicate when an initial public offering would take place, although some observers believe a summer or early autumn stock market debut in London remains on the cards.\n\nShein had initially targeted a New York listing but has been beset by political opposition which has resulted in a lukewarm reception from regulators.\n\nBy contrast, Sky News revealed earlier this year that Donald Tang, Shein's executive chairman, had met Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor, earlier this year, alongside other ministers and executives from the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe meeting between Mr Hunt and Mr Tang underlined the importance that British officials are attaching to the idea of trumping the US in an effort to land the Shein IPO.\n\nMr Tang is also understood to have spoken to a number of frontbench Labour politicians, including Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary in recent months.\n\nThe filing of a prospectus with the FCA does not guarantee that the company will list in London, with a final decision subject to meetings with fund managers and the approval of listing authorities in the UK.\n\nHowever, people close to the process said it represented a significant moment that meant a City float for Shein was now highly likely.\n\nShein has been at the centre of controversy over its use of cotton from the Xinjiang region of China and other issues related to workers' rights and its vast supply chain.\n\nIf it does proceed with a London listing, Shein is expected to seek to raise over \u00a31bn from the sale of new shares to investors.\n\nThis would, however, be relatively modest in the context of an anticipated valuation of \u00a350bn or more.\n\nThe company was valued at $66bn in its last funding round early last year.\n\nLast month, Sky News revealed that Sajid Javid, the former chancellor of the exchequer, has been approached about taking a role at Shein.\n\nIf the discussions proceed, they could see him either join Shein's board or become an adviser to the Chinese-founded company.\n\nShein could be responsible for staging the London Stock Exchange's second-largest IPO in history, behind the 2011 stock market debut of Glencore International, the commodities trading and mining group.\n\nGoldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley are advising on the deal.\n\nRead more from business:\n\nOfwat hits Thames Water with \u00a340m fine\n\nSuperdry wins reprieve as M&G drops challenge\n\nFancy dress brand Smiffys on the brink\n\nFounded in China in 2012, Shein was valued at over $100bn in 2022, at which point it was worth more than H&M and Zara's parent company, Inditex, combined.\n\nIt operates in more than 150 countries and boasts 150m users globally.\n\nThe LSE's efforts to court Shein come during a challenging period for the City as a listing venue for large multinationals, with ARM Holdings, the UK-based chip designer, opting to float in New York rather than London.\n\nOther companies, such as the gambling operator Flutter Entertainment and tour operator TUI, have shifted their listings away from London, citing higher valuations and more liquid markets.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, London has landed the prospective IPOs of Raspberry Pi, the personal computer maker, delivering a boost to the City.\n\nLast month, Mr Hunt hosted a summit at Dorneywood attended by technology companies such as Raspberry Pi and Monzo, the digital bank valued at over \u00a34bn, as part of efforts to encourage them to list in the UK.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The move comes as the company's U.S. listing plans faced setbacks due to regulatory pressures and the growing tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nAccording to Sky News, Shein could file its IPO prospectus with the UK regulators as early as next week. However, British lawmakers are seeking greater scrutiny of the Chinese retailer and raising questions over its London listing. In response, Shein has pledged to improve governance and compliance standards.\n\nHeadquartered in Singapore, Shein is a fast-fashion brand offering an affordable range of trendy items and products. The company caters to customers in over 150 countries through its online platform.\n\nIn November 2023, Shein submitted its IPO filing for the U.S. listing, aiming to become one of the largest IPOs in recent years. However, the company faced challenges due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and China, along with regulatory obstacles.\n\nEarlier in May 2023, Shein attained a valuation of approximately $66 billion during a fundraising round, but it was targeting an even higher valuation through the U.S. IPO.\n\nIn just 11 years, Shein has disrupted the clothing industry with its low-cost offerings, becoming one of the largest fashion brands globally. According to the Financial Times, the company's profits soared to over $2 billion in 2023. In a short period, Shein has gained huge popularity among online shoppers in terms of its competitive pricing, relevance, platform experience, and swift response to fashion trends.\n\nIn the UK market, Shein has exerted pressure on local online fashion giants such as ASOS PLC (GB:ASC) and Boohoo Group (GB:BOO). Shein is progressing at a time when these retailers are struggling to keep up their sales following the pandemic boom.\n\nIn the first half of FY24, ASOS announced a pre-tax loss of \u00a3270 million and an 18% decline in adjusted revenue on a constant currency basis. Rising competition presents an opportunity for ASOS to address shortcomings in its system by prioritizing a user-friendly experience while offering trending clothing at affordable prices.\n\nMeanwhile, Shein continues to strengthen its presence in key markets. In October 2023, the company bought the Missguided brand name from Frasers Group (GB:FRAS) to revive the brand and attract a larger share of young shoppers in the UK market.\n\nAmid rising competition and macro pressures, ASC stock has received a Hold consensus rating based on two Buys, five Holds, and three Sell recommendations from analysts. The ASOS share price forecast is 387.78p, which is 4% higher than the current trading level.", "source": {"uri": "markets.businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Markets Insider"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fast fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASOS_(retailer)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ASOS (retailer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clothing industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasers_Group", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frasers Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missguided", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missguided"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boohoo.com", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boohoo.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_limited_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public limited company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://blog.tipranks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot-2024-06-03-at-10.13.15-AM-1024x458.png?utm_source=markets.businessinsider.com&utm_medium=referral", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614569", "eventUri": "eng-9614569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Shein's potential decision to opt for London comes after initial efforts to float in New York were derailed when a number of politicians and industry regulators raised concerns over the tensions between Beijing and Washington.\n\nIn bid to woo the retailer away from a New York listing, current U.K. chancellor Jeremy Hunt met with Shein's executive chair Donald Tang earlier this year in a bid to try and persuade Shein to list in London.\n\nYet if opinion polls prove correct, the future of the Conservative government in Britain is likely to be short-lived, with a General Election called for 4 July that is widely expected to return a Labour government.\n\nBecause of that, more significant may be the fact that Jonathan Reynolds, the opposition's shadow business secretary [who would become the government business secretary if Labour wins], plus Sarah Jones, the shadow minister for industry, and Chris Bryant, the shadow minister for creative industries, have also recently met with Tang to discuss the possible listing.\n\nAccording to The Times, should Labour come to power next month, it would support Shein floating in the U.K. and although the expected filing of a prospectus does not guarantee that the company will list in the U.K., it does represent a significant next step ahead of a flotation in London, according to broadcaster Sky News.\n\nHowever, as in the U.S., some senior British lawmakers have also questioned Shein's suitability for a London listing and have called for greater scrutiny of the business. Shein has been at the centre of controversy over its use of cotton from the Xinjiang region of China and other issues related to labor rights across its global supply chain.\n\nShein has responded by claiming that it is strengthening governance and compliance and has been at pains to improve its environmental record.\n\nThe fast fashion retailer posted profits of more than $2 billion last year, nearly double the $1.1 billion it recorded just two years prior in 2021, and if it is listed in the U.K. it is estimated that it could be valued at over $63 billion.\n\nThe listing, currently anticipated as most likely this summer or early fall, would break all records and exceed the biggest previous London listing for commodities company Glencore's $48.3 billion float in 2011 and the 2022 Haleon spin-off from GSK's consumer goods arm for $38.7 billion.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They discovered that bags, belts, clothes, and other items sold to children contain over 400 times the safe level of forever chemicals.\n\nThis is a big deal for the United States since statistics showed that Shein ships around 1 million packages daily to the US. For those who are unaware, forever chemicals can cause cancer and autism.\n\nIf children are highly exposed to forever chemicals, their health could be jeopardized. However, Shein told the SoKor officials that conducted the random tests that it takes product safety very seriously, claiming that it has performed over 400,000 chemical safety tests since 2023.\n\nRead Also: Shein Faces Scrutiny From China's Internet Regulator Ahead of US IPO\n\nAccording to The South China Morning Post, Shein is scrutinized ahead of a potential London listing.

Shein's decision to opt for London comes after an initial effort to float in New York was derailed when politicians and regulators raised concerns about tensions between Beijing and Washington.\n\nIn the UK, the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, met Donald Tang, Shein's executive chair earlier this year to try to persuade Shein to list in the UK rather than New York.\n\nOn Monday, the Times reported that Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, Sarah Jones, the shadow minister for industry, and Chris Bryant, the shadow minister for creative industries, had recently met Tang to discuss listing.\n\nSources told the paper that should Labour come to power in July, it would be very supportive of Shein floating in the UK.\n\nThe company, which was launched in Nanjing, China in 2012, has rapidly become one of the world's largest fashion retailers because of its low prices and high-volume sales.\n\nIt is headquartered in Singapore and, while most of its suppliers are based in China, it does not sell products to the country.\n\nThe company posted more than $2bn of profits in 2023, nearly double the $1.1bn in 2021. If listed in the UK it is understood that it could be valued at \u00a350bn.\n\nThe expected filing of a prospectus does not guarantee that the company will list in the UK but people close to the process told Sky News - which first reported the impending filing - said it represented significant moment that meant a City float for Shein was very likely.\n\nHowever, senior politicians, including three parliamentary committee chairs, have questioned efforts to woo Shein, raising concerns about labour conditions in its supply chains.\n\nShein hit back at the comments, saying it took visibility across its supply chain seriously and had zero-tolerance to forced labour and was committed to human rights.\n\nIf Shein does list in the UK it would be a significant boost in what has been a gloomy period for the LSE, with a number of high-profile companies leaving the UK for listings elsewhere.\n\nLast month the Paddy Power owner Flutter confirmed that it was moving its listing from London to New York, while the UK chip designer Arm opted to list on Wall Street last August after the government failed to persuade it to float in the UK.\n\nEarlier this year the Anglo-German travel company Tui voted to abandon the London Stock Exchange in favour of listing its shares solely in Germany. However, there was some good news last month, when the UK-based tech firm Raspberry Pi confirmed its intention to float in the UK.\n\nThe listing would eclipse the biggest listing seen on the LSE - the commodities company Glencore's \u00a338bn float in 2011 - and the spin-out of GSK's consumer goods arm as Haleon, at \u00a330.5bn in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType":

Report claims e-tailer Shein is a step closer to London IPO", "body": "Published\n\nJun 2, 2024 Reading time\n\n2 minutes Download\n\nPrint\n\nText size\n\naA+ aA- Decision made? Report claims e-tailer Shein is a step closer to London IPO Published\n\nJun 2, 2024\n\nAfter months of speculation, it's reported that budget fashion e-tail giant Shein has just-about-decided the location for its IPO and London is almost certainly the chosen stock exchange.\n\nNot that Shein has confirmed anything. As it has done during the whole period that has seen speculation buzzing around its IPO intentions, the company has kept its cards close to its chest.\n\nInstead, the news was reported by Sky, which does have a strong track record when it comes to breaking stories about stock exchange-listed fashion firms.\n\nAds\n\nSky said Shein is \"preparing to file a prospectus with the Financial Conduct Authority for approval ahead of its potential float\". Admittedly, that's still a few steps away from it actually happening, but it's still closer than it's been so far. much closer...\n\nIf it does opt for a London listing (which observers are now saying is \"highly likely\"), Shein is expected to be targeting a raise of more than \u00a31 billion from the sale of new shares. But that wouldn't materially disrupt its current ownership as the business is seen as being worth about \u00a350 billion in total.\n\nThe company, which was founded in China and still manufactures there, is now headquartered in Singapore, but its Chinese links meant it would likely have run into difficulties had it pursed what was widely reported to be its original choice -- an IPO in New York where the political environment wouldn't be very welcoming.\n\nCity sources told Sky on Sunday that the prospectus filing could now take place as soon as this week, although it could be later this month. There has also been speculation that the IPO itself could happen later this summer or early in the autumn.\n\nIf the float does happen in London, it would be the biggest there in over a decade. For a London Stock Exchange that has lost much of its dominance in recent years (as well as losing a number of listed fashion firms such as Ted Baker, Seraphine and, probably, Superdry), it would be a vote of confidence.\n\nFor that reason, the British government has been working hard to convince Shein that London is the place to be. Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt recently met Shein executive chairman Donald Tang as part of London's charm offensive. Former Chancellor Sajid Javid has also reportedly held talks with Shein over possibly joining its board or becoming an advisor to the business.\n\nAnd Tang is believed to have held discussions with a number of senior Labour politicians too. Given that the polls suggest the UK will have a Labour government by the time of the float, that makes a lot of sense.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 FashionNetwork.com All rights reserved.\n\nTags :

with the company's executive chairman, Donald Tang, to add its support, according to the Times newspaper.\n\nHowever, the company, which based on its \u00a352 billion valuation last year would be London's largest ever IPO, has faced calls for greater scrutiny from both UK political parties to allegations of unethical business practices.\n\nShein previously was looking at a New York listing but faced political and regulatory push-back, and it is reported that the China Securities Regulatory Commission told the company that it would not recommend a US IPO due to \"supply chain issues\".\n\nIf Beijing approves the London listing under its new listing rules for Chinese firms going public offshore, the Singapore-headquartered company can then file its application to join the London Stock Exchange.\n\nThe Labour Party's shadow business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow minister for industry, Sarah Jones, and shadow minister for creative industries, Chris Bryant, met Tang to discuss a potential IPO, the Times reported.\n\nLabour, which is leading in the polls ahead of the 4 July general election, is \"very supportive\" of Shein listing in the UK, sources told the

Sky News earlier reported Shein's plan to file.\n\nShein's offering could become one of the UK's biggest ever IPOs, clawing back a chunk of the market value London has lost from companies shifting their primary listings to New York. The London Stock Exchange also has largely missed out on this year's revival of European IPOs.\n\nRead more: London IPO for Shein Would Help Repair Damage From US Defections\n\nBloomberg News reported in February that Shein was actively looking at London as it had judged it unlikely that the US Securities and Exchange Commission would approve a New York IPO.

Last week (30 May) South Korean regulators claimed to have found phthalates at levels hundreds of times above safety limits in Shein kids' leather shoes and goods. It's a stomach-churning revelation that should jolt any parent.\n\nIt's not the first time the Singapore-based e-commerce giant has been the subject of such allegations. In 2022, a report from Greenpeace alleged Shein had a \"business model based on hazardous chemicals and environmental destruction\" after 15% of 47 products that were tested contained toxic chemicals that broke EU regulatory limits, with five breaking the limit by 100% or more.\n\nThe allegation of toxic chemicals was explained away with corporate platitudes about the company's dedication to safety testing and selling \"reliable products,\" said a Shein spokesperson.\n\nIn the latest accusation, a spokesperson told Just Style that Shein took its product safety very seriously and \"immediately removed\" the products from its site whilst conducting an investigation.\n\nBut repeat offences on the chemical safety front are raising questions around how seriously the ultrafast fashion giant actually takes the matter.\n\nIt also points to why the US has been keen to repel Shein from further penetrating the market, rebuffing attempts for a New York bourse listing.\n\nWhat is rather concerning is that the UK, on the other hand, seems quite keen to welcome Shein with Jeremy Hunt, chancellor of the exchequer, meeting with Shein bosses in February and urging them to pursue a float.\n\nA recent parody by Saturday Night Live (SNL) exposed how the public is effectively overlooking Shein's behaviour in part due to the benefits it gets such as access to the latest styles at rock-bottom prices. The sketch portrayed a fictitious ultra-fast fashion brand \"Xiemu\" churning out $5 lead-tainted dresses and gasoline-scented tops, complete with Hollywood a-lister, Jake Gyllenhaal, having a nosebleed after sniffing his \"lead-free\" shirt.\n\nShein has attempted to brush off such criticism as unfair isolated incidents. But as reports continue to pile up with even more damning evidence against it, it is clear its profit-\u00fcber-alles (above all else) attitude that enabled its dizzying ascent is now its greatest liability.\n\nShein is rapidly approaching that moment of truth -- a real awakening. Miss that wake-up call, and the fall could be as steep as the rise.\n\nShein denies alleged 'widespread' toxic chemicals in products\n\nSouth Korea has alleged harmful chemicals were found in seven of eight children's leather goods from ultra-fast-fashion giant Shein tested in Seoul, with an industry expert claiming this was not an isolated incident, however Shein maintains it is dedicated to safety testing and selling \"reliable products\".\n\nTunisia apparel sector sets ambitious targets for green transition\n\nThe Tunisia textile and apparel industry launched its Tunisian Textile Green Transition (TTGT) project in April to become more innovative, smart, and ecological, and meet international sustainability requirements.\n\nSri Lanka warned law reforms could create 'sweatshop labour'\n\nA coalition of international labour and human rights organisations have urged Sri Lanka's government to \"immediately halt\" labour law reforms, as they allege the proposals could turn the country's garment factories into the \"worst forms of sweatshop labour\".\n\nExplainer: Is wholesale getting too risky for fashion brands?\n\nIndependent fashion label The Vampire's Wife blamed the wholesale market for its recent closure and other brands continue to cite wholesale problems in their financial results, so is it time for apparel brands to consider investing solely in direct-to-consumer?\n\n2.5m Africans' livelihoods buoyed by second-hand clothing trade\n\nA new report has shed light on the second-hand clothing (SHC) sector in Africa, revealing an estimated 1.28m people employed in the trade, with 2.5m Africans dependent on income from the sector.\n\nNike, Inditex rank among Gartner's Global Supply Chain Top 25\n\nGlobal apparel brands NIKE and Inditex have

Sources suggest that if Labour comes into power in July, it would be supportive of Shein floating in the UK.\n\nLaunched in Nanjing, China in 2012, Shein has quickly become one of the world's largest fashion retailers due to its low prices and high-volume sales. Despite being headquartered in Singapore and having most of its suppliers based in China, Shein does not sell products to China. The company posted profits exceeding $2 billion in 2023, nearly double its $1.1 billion earnings in 2021.\n\nSenior politicians, including three parliamentary committee chairs, have raised concerns about labour conditions within Shein's supply chains. In response, Shein stated it took visibility across its supply chain seriously, had \"zero-tolerance to forced labour,\" and was committed to human rights.

The most expensive dress of the nearly 9,000 new arrivals - a floor-length, long-sleeved, fully sequinned plus-size gown, available in five sparkly colours - is $67. The cheapest - a short, tight piece of polyester with spaghetti straps, a cowl neckline and an all-over print of Renaissance-style flowers and cherubs - is $7.\n\nI can buy casual dresses, going-out tops, workout leggings, winter parkas, pink terry-cloth hooded rompers, purple double-breasted suit jackets with matching trousers, red pleather straight-leg pants, cropped cardigans with mushroom embroidery, black sheer lace thongs and rhinestone-trimmed hijabs. I can buy a wedding dress for $37. I can buy clothes for school, work, basketball games, proms, funerals, nightclubs, sex clubs. I see patchwork-printed overalls and black bikinis with rhinestones in the shape of a skull over each nipple designated as \"punk\". I can buy Christian-girl modesty clothing and borderline fetish wear.\n\nIn the grid of product listings, a yellow rectangle indicates if a product is trending: \"Trending-Plazacore\", \"Trending-Western\", \"Trending-Mermaidcore\", and \"Trending-Y2K\" tags all appear in the new arrivals....\n\nBut, Shein's high-octane 'test and repeat' model - in which it churns out thousands of new products a day - is also controversial, and seen the company dubbed \"the unacceptable face of throwaway fast fashion\".\n\nShein has also been accused of using forced labour to produce its low-cost garments. In 2022, Bloomberg discovered that garments shipped to the US by Shein were made with cotton from the Xinjiang region, where China is accused of \"serious human rights violations\" against the Uyghur Muslim people.\n\nBut that probably won't deter the City from embracing Shein, given the well-documented concerns that the London market is in crisis as some firms shift their listings across the Atlantic.\n\nIt's a busy day for economic news, with new surveys of factory bosses across the world giving a healthcheck on global manufacturing.\n\nTraders are digesting yesterday's Opec+ meeting, where oil producers agreed to extend their production cuts into 2025.\n\nTensions are rising in South Wales, where union leaders are preparing to ramp up industrial action at two steelworks, in a further escalation of a row over almost 3,000 job losses that threatens to become a big general election issue.\n\nAnd in France, the government has been stung by a credit rating downgrade by S&P Global on Friday night, from AA to AA- with a stable outlook.\n\nS&P Global cited France's rising debts and lower-than-expected growth - a blow to Emmanuel Macron's stewardship of the economy...",

A Shein float would be the biggest in London since 2011, when Swiss commodities trading giant Glencore was valued at \u00a336 billion\n\nAnd it would be big enough to propel Shein into the FTSE 100. If the firm was valued at \u00a351 billion, it would put it in twelfth place on the main stock index. It would slot in just above the operator of the market itself, London Stock Exchange, and just under British American Tobacco.\n\nJoshua Mahony at Scope Markets said: \"This deal would add strength to the FTSE 100 brand, indicating that London is an attractive place to list.\n\n\"It would add weight at a time when many have been questioning the credentials of the index compared with its US counterparts.\"\n\nSuch a high-profile arrival could become a major turning point for the City.\n\nEver since one of its former darlings - Arm Holdings - chose New York over London when it returned to life as a public company worth $55 billion (\u00a343 billion) in 2023, there have been concerns about relatively lower corporate valuations on offer in the UK stock market.\n\nThere has been an eye-watering exodus from the market this year. Multinational firms including building products giant CRH and betting powerhouse Flutter have left London for New York. Others chose to delist via private equity. Mergers with overseas companies taking firms under foreign ownership became commonplace.\n\nRecently, firms with a combined market value of around \u00a3100 billion were at risk of going or had left, although that figure included the near \u00a340 billion offer for Anglo American from BHP, which fell through last week.\n\nConcern that a collapse in investment from UK pension funds in London-listed shares had drained the City's pool of capital has led to calls for government action. The issue is likely to be part of the general election campaign.\n\nShein's stellar popularity with Gen Z shoppers, known for being equally sensitive for style and price, has made it into the one of the biggest fashion brands in the world since it was founded in Nanjing in 2008 by entrepreneur Chris Xu.\n\nBut has also faced controversy over labour practices, including long hours and even forced working, of which it says it has \"zero tolerance\".\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said: \"Shein may find the glare of a public market listing uncomfortable given concerns about its governance, supply chain and business practices. Boohoo's recent history provides a salutary lesson here.\n\n\"Clearly London will want the IPO to be a success to help rebuild its reputation as a listing venue so there's a lot riding on it for both parties\".\n\nTroubled politics between the US and China are seen as part of Shein's decision to move toward a City listing. And it previously filed the equivalent paperwork in New York.\n\nAny such arrival of a large and well-known firm on this scale would help restore London's fortunes at a critical time.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

It hasn't set a deadline for delivering on that promise, but in 2023, it bought 21,792 square yards of the stuff. Shein calculates that this action saved 41 million gallons of water, eliminated 3,000 kilograms of chemicals and avoided the equivalent of 29 metric tons of carbon dioxide -- the environmental cost of making the material from scratch.\n\nFashion causes 92 million metric tons of textile waste annually, because consumers are throwing away clothes more quickly after wearing them fewer times. It also has a heavy carbon footprint, estimated at 4 to 6 percent of annual global emissions -- more than aviation. Shein, founded in 2008, has been under closer scrutiny by fashion sustainability experts since 2017, when it began its big push into the U.S. market. Among other things, their concern is that Shein's low prices and hyper-fast new product cycle encourage unsustainable consumption and resource use -- issues that the deadstock plan will not address.\n\n\"One of the goals in our sustainability journey is to achieve a fully circular economy by 2050,\" said Caitrin Watson, director of sustainability at Shein, when the \"rescued deadstock\" milestone was announced in early May. \"To meaningfully reduce emissions in the fashion industry we need to not only minimize our own waste, but collectively to eliminate the concept of waste altogether.\"\n\nDeadstock comes in many forms, from fully sewn garments to bolts of unused material. The unsold inventory sent to landfills, burned or buried in warehouses each year is worth $288 billion, according to Queen of Raw, a company partnering with Shein on the project. Queen of Raw operates a digital marketplace that puts waste textiles back into commercial circulation.\n\n\"The companies holding the deadstock, which is the majority of traditional retail companies, they don't have an avenue to use it,\" Watson said. \"If we can be a rescuer of this deadstock fabric, we can test it in different styles and see what customers want to wear.\"\n\nThere are \"dozens\" of women's dresses, shirts, skirts and other items in Shein's first deadstock-inspired collection. Seventy-five of Shein's manufacturers are participating in their production, using rescued and recycled polyester, rayon, spandex and other materials sourced through Queen of Raw. Most of the fabric is sourced locally, near Shein's existing production facilities in China, according to Shein and Queen of Raw.\n\nShein has been public about its goal but other brands are waking up to the value of deadstock in a circular strategy, said Queen of Raw CEO Stephanie Benedetto. \"This is a great sustainable alternative to work with, finally, at a good price point,\" she said. Her company also counts Nike, Ralph Lauren and Cotapaxi as clients for its sourcing services.\n\nToday, apparel sourced from deadstock accounts for a tiny sliver of Shein's overall production. The company declined to disclose how many items it sells annually. One recent analysis estimates Shein introduces more than 1 million new styles in one year, dwarfing the output of older fast-fashion brands such as Zara.\n\n\"Shein is doing a great thing with this, because they are such a big platform and they are getting these items out to everybody,\" said Mel Dorey, a designer who frequently reuses fabrics, such as old duvet covers, in her fashions. Dorey contributed several pieces to Shein's first deadstock collection. \"It gets people thinking and talking,\" she said.\n\nTraditionally, fashion houses and their designers work on a seasonal schedule, producing four collections per year consisting of a limited number of styles, to be sold en masse at retail.\n\nThat is not how Shein does it.\n\nThe privately held company, which could pull in close to $60 billion in sales for 2025, relies on an \"instant fashion\" sales model. Shein produces small 100- to 200-item batches of dresses, shirts, pants or other apparel. It scales production for items that take off, relying on data from its e-commerce technology to project what's needed and where.\n\n\"They make fast fashion look slow,\" said Ken Pucker, professor of practice with the Tufts Fletcher School. \"Their model is potent.\"\n\nShein's existing on-demand model made it relatively straightforward to introduce deadstock, but it needed to adjust its quality control, design and production processes, Shein's Watson told GreenBiz in one of several interviews.\n\nThe adjustments included:\n\nShein's deadstock effort is one component of its nascent sustainability strategy, launched in April 2022. The pledge calls for Shein to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent across its direct operations, energy and supply chains by 2030. So far, it hasn't reported progress toward that goal: In 2022, Shein's emissions increased by 52 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, Shein has pledged to source at least 50 percent of its products from \"preferred\" materials by the end of the decade, leaning heavily on recycled polyester, forest-safe viscose and surplus fabrics.\n\nShein has many vocal critics such as Tufts' Pucker, who say the company's low prices and hyper-fast new product cycle encourage unsustainable consumption and resource use. \"It's not just that it's more polyester, chemicals and microfibers, it's the associated negative externalities that are unfunded and impact all of humanity.\"\n\nShein's method of delivering products one-by-one to consumers, often using air freight, is particularly damaging because the company's doesn't pay the same import duties as other apparel companies and transportation-related emissions can't be managed as easily, said Rachel Kibbe, CEO of circular fashion advisory firm Circular Services Group. Shein's deadstock program \"rings hollow\" given that the company is flooding thrift stores with \"low-quality\" items that contribute to the industry's waste challenges, she said.\n\n\"If Shein raised their prices, paid U.S. duties, were transparent about their data harvesting practices, and produced products that had transparent supply chains, better quality and value, there would be reason to believe that they meant to improve their footprint,\" Kibbe said. \"Until then, it's all window dressing.\"\n\nShein is preparing its 2023 sustainability progress report for release, said Watson. Meanwhile, the company in mid-May said it plans investments of at least $70 million across its supply chain to encourage more \"responsible\" operations and to address ongoing allegations of human rights abuses in Southern China, where the majority of its garments are made.", "source": {"uri": "greenbiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GreenBiz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shein", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vintage_clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vintage clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circular economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rayon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_fashion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast fashion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Lauren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Lauren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zara_(retailer)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zara (retailer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spandex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyester", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polyester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business", "label": "dmoz/Business", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Clothing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Clothing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Design/Fashion", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.greenbiz.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_1200x630/public/2024-05/PS202404162035_%E9%A6%96%E5%9B%BE-scaled.jpg?itok=KJXzGugA", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9614569", "eventUri": "eng-9614569", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Richard Gadd plays himself in the Netflix series \u2013 which states at the start it is \u2018a true story\u2019 \u2013 all about his \u2018stalker\u2019 Martha, who internet sleuths seemingly found out to be based on Harvey. Since, Harvey has also claimed to be the \u2018real Martha\u2019 \u2013 and she was even interviewed by Piers Morgan all about the explosive series. It\u2019s now been reported that Harvey, 58, is seeking monetary damages from Netflix of at least $170,000,000 (\u00a3132,000,000) for her supposed depiction in the series. According to Variety, Harvey is alleging defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligence, and violations of her right of publicity. While many might brush Harvey\u2019s reported legal intentions off as unlikely to come to anything, lawyer Alexander Cameron, member of the Forum of the Insurance Lawyers and Legal Director at Birketts, thinks she poses a real challenge to the Californian streaming company. Harvey could post a real legal threat to Netflix over her supposed portrayal in the series, a lawyer has told Metro.co.uk (Picture: Ed Miller/Netflix) Richard Gadd starred as himself in the series, which said at the start it was a \u2018true story\u2019 (Picture: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP) \u2018Despite the British dimension to this story, California is the obvious place to bring this lawsuit,\u2019 he told Metro.co.uk. \u2018Netflix is headquartered there and should the claim for defamation etc. succeed, the court potentially may award tens of millions of dollars in damages,\u2019 he added, explaining how Harvey thinks her reputation has been destroyed by the series. English courts do not give monetary values on this scale in defamation claims. Also, California law protects \u2018publicity rights\u2019 \u2013 the right to prevent unauthorised use of a person\u2019s name or likeness by a third party for commercial benefit. Cameron explained: \u2018Netflix intends to \u201cdefend this matter vigorously\u201d referring to the right of Gadd to \u201ctell his story\u201d and US First Amendment protection for freedom of expression will feature in the proceedings.

Baby Reindeer was streamed over 60million times in its first month, and subsequently it wasn\u2019t long before internet detectives trawled social media trying to identify the real people behind the characters in the show. Gadd urged viewers not to track them down, stressing it \u2018misses the point\u2019 of the series. In a matter of days though, Harvey\u2019s real tweets to Gadd were unearthed, and spread like wildfire on X, as she chose to give her side of the story on Morgan\u2019s YouTube channel. Got a story?

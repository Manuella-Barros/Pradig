Matthias Ecke, 41, a member of Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), was hit and kicked on Friday by a group of four people while putting up posters in Dresden, capital of the eastern state of Saxony, police said. An SPD source said his injuries would require an operation.\n\nShortly before, what appeared to be the same group attacked a 28-year-old campaigner for the Greens, who was also putting up posters, police said, although his injuries were not as severe. \"Democracy is threatened by this kind of thing,\" Scholz told a convention of European socialists in Berlin.\n\nThe attacks exemplify increased violence in Germany in recent years, often from the far-right, targeting especially leftist politicians. The BfV domestic intelligence agency says far-right extremism is the biggest threat to German democracy. Saxony premier Michael Kretschmer, a conservative, said such aggression and attempts at intimidation recalled the darkest era of German history, a reference to Nazi rule.\n\nThe president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, a former German conservative minister, and the Italian head of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, both condemned the attack on Ecke. \"The culprits must be brought to account,\" von der Leyen said on X.\n\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser vowed \"tough action and further protective measures\" in response to the attacks. FAR-RIGHT SUPPORT\n\nThe heads of the SPD in Saxony, Henning Homann and Kathrin Michel, issued a statement in which they blamed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) for the rise in violence. \"These people and their supporters bear responsibility for what is happening in this country,\" they said.\n\nThe AfD did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The party says it is the victim of a campaign by the media and political establishment. The AfD has seen a surge in\n\nsupport in the past year take it to second place in opinion polls nationwide. It is particularly strong in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg, where surveys suggest it could come first in regional elections in September. Nationwide, the number of attacks on politicians of parties represented in parliament has doubled since 2019, according to government figures published in January.\n\nGreens party politicians face the most aggression, according to the data, with attacks on them rising sevenfold since 2019 to 1,219 last year. AfD politicians suffered 478 attacks and the SPD was third with 420. Theresa Ertel, a Greens candidate in municipal elections in Thuringia this month, said she knew of party members who no longer wanted to stand because of the aggressive political atmosphere.\n\nThe Greens in her region had agreed that information stands should always have at least three staff for extra safety.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

Matthias Ecke, 41, a member of Faeser's Social Democrats (SPD), was hit and kicked by a group of four people while putting up posters in Dresden, capital of the eastern state of Saxony, police said.\n\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser on Saturday vowed to fight a surge in violence against politicians after a German member of the European Parliament had to be taken to hospital after being attacked while campaigning for re-election.\n\nMatthias Ecke, 41, a member of Faeser's Social Democrats (SPD), was hit and kicked by a group of four people while putting up posters in Dresden, capital of the eastern state of Saxony, police said. An SPD source said his injuries would require an operation. Shortly before, what appeared to be the same group attacked a 28-year-old campaigner for the Greens, who was also putting up posters, police said, although his injuries were not as grievous.\n\n\"The constitutional state must and will respond to this with tough action and further protective measures for the democratic forces in our country,\" Faeser said in a statement, saying the attack on Ecke was also an \"attack on democracy\". European Parliament President Roberta Metsola was one of many European politicians to sympathise with Ecke, saying in a post on X that she was \"horrified by the vicious attack\".\n\nNationwide, the number of attacks on politicians of parties represented in parliament has doubled since 2019, according to government figures published in January. Faeser said the verbal hostility of extremists and populists towards democratic politicians was partly responsible for the rise in violence.\n\nThe BfV domestic intelligence agency says far-right extremism is the biggest threat to German democracy. A surge in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) over the past year has taken it to second place in nationwide polls.\n\nThe AfD is particularly strong in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg. Surveys suggest it will come first in regional elections in all three this September. Greens party politicians face the most aggression, according to the government data, with attacks on them rising sevenfold since 2019 to 1,219 last year. AfD politicians suffered 478 attacks and the SPD was third with 420.\n\nTheresa Ertel, a Greens candidate in municipal elections in Thuringia this month, said she knew of party members who no longer wanted to stand because of the aggressive political atmosphere. The Greens in her region had agreed that information stands should always have at least three staff for extra safety.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Faeser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Faeser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Ministry_of_the_Interior_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Ecke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthias Ecke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dresden"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dresden"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxony", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberta_Metsola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roberta Metsola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Office_for_the_Protection_of_the_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alternative for Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weimar Republic"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Populism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandenburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandenburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuringia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thuringia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thuringia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_16_53_54_7540817.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539335", "eventUri": "eng-9539335", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

a 28-year-old Greens campaigner on the same street, police said.\n\nThe assaults have been condemned by a number of politicians, with Scholz saying on Saturday that: \"Democracy is threatened by this kind of act.\"\n\nSpeaking to a congress of European socialist parties in Berlin, he said: \"We must never accept such acts of violence... we must oppose it together.\"\n\nInterior Minister Nancy

The party says it is the victim of a campaign by the media and political establishment.\n\nThe AfD has seen a surge in support in the past year take it to second place in opinion polls nationwide. It is particularly strong in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg, where surveys suggest it could come first in regional elections in September.\n\nNationwide, the number of attacks on politicians of parties represented in parliament has doubled since 2019, according to government figures published in January.\n\nGreens party politicians face the most aggression, according to the data, with attacks on them rising sevenfold since 2019 to 1,219 last year. AfD politicians suffered 478 attacks and the SPD was third with 420.\n\nTheresa Ertel, a Greens candidate in municipal elections in Thuringia this month, said she knew of party members who no longer wanted to stand because of the aggressive political atmosphere.\n\nThe Greens in her region had agreed that information stands should always have at least three staff for extra safety.", "source":

17-year-old turned himself in to German police Sunday after an attack on a lawmaker that the country's leaders decried as a threat to democracy, as thousands turned out to march against political violence.\n\nThe teenager reported to police in the eastern city of Dresden early Sunday morning and said he was \"the perpetrator who had knocked down the SPD politician\", police said in a statement.\n\nMatthias Ecke, 41, a European parliament lawmaker for Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), was set upon by four attackers as he put up EU election posters in Dresden on Friday night, according to police.\n\nEcke was \"seriously injured\" and required an operation after the attack, his party said.\n\nScholz on Saturday condemned the attack as a threat to democracy.\n\n\"We must never accept such acts of violence,\" he said.\n\n\"If an attack with a political motive... is confirmed just a few weeks from the European elections, this serious act of violence would also be a serious act against democracy,\" Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said.\n\nPolice later Sunday wrote on X, formerly Twitter, that the 17-year-old, who had no previous criminal record, had so far \"not commented on the motive for the offence\".\n\nArmin Schuster, interior minister for Saxony state, said police were still searching for the other attackers and he urged them to turn themselves in.\n\n- Demonstrations -\n\nEcke, who is head of the SPD's European election list in the Saxony region, was just the latest political target to be attacked in Germany.\n\nPolice said a 28-year-old man putting up posters for the Greens had been \"punched\" and \"kicked\" earlier in the evening on the same Dresden street.\n\nLast week two Greens deputies were abused while campaigning in Essen in western Germany and another was surrounded by dozens of demonstrators in her car in the east of the country.\n\nAccording to provisional police figures, 2,790 crimes were committed against politicians in Germany in 2023, up from 1,806 the previous year, but fewer than the 2,840 recorded in 2021, when legislative elections took place.\n\nThousands of people attended demonstrations in solidarity with Ecke on Sunday.\n\nIn Dresden, around 3,000 people gathered in the city centre following a call from political parties and civil society organisations, according to a police spokesman.\n\nIn Berlin, an AFP reporter put the number at around 2,000.\n\n\"It's important to me to do something about the fact that this hatred is flooding people,\" a 70-year-old protester who gave her name only as Gudrun told AFP.\n\nFaeser is planning to call a special conference with Germany's regional interior ministers next week to address violence against politicians, according to

An SPD source said his injuries would require an operation.\n\nShortly before, what appeared to be the same group attacked a 28-year-old campaigner for the Greens, who was also putting up posters, police said, although his injuries were not as serious.\n\n\"The constitutional state must and will respond to this with tough action and further protective measures for the democratic forces in our country,\" Faeser said in a statement, saying the attack on Ecke was also an \"attack on democracy\".\n\nEuropean parliament president Roberta Metsola was one of many European politicians to sympathise with Ecke, saying in a post on X that she was \"horrified by the vicious attack\".\n\nNationwide, the number of attacks on politicians of parties represented in parliament has doubled since 2019, according to government figures published in January. Faeser said the verbal hostility of extremists and populists towards democratic politicians was partly responsible for the rise in violence.\n\nThe BfV domestic intelligence agency says far-right extremism is the biggest threat to German democracy.\n\nA surge in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) over the past year has taken it to second place in nationwide polls. The AfD is particularly strong in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg. Surveys suggest it will come first in regional elections in all three this September.\n\nGreens party politicians face the most aggression, according to government data, with attacks on them rising sevenfold since 2019 to 1,219 last year.

They are believed to be young men between 17 and 20 years old.\n\nEcke is the SPD's top candidate in the state of Saxony for June's European elections. He has served in the European Parliament since 2022.\n\nThe attack shocked the country and prompted outrage in Germany, with politicians from a number of different parties decrying the violence and warning of a threat to German democracy.\n\nIn her address, SPD party leader Esken blamed the attack on the seeds of social division and messages of contempt for democracy from far-right parties and far-right extremists.\n\n\"In this respect, these people who have threatened to hunt us down, to clean up this country, to muck it out, also share responsibility for the social climate in which such acts are possible,\" she said.\n\n\"We will oppose this as a constitutional state, but of course also as a society and as political parties.\"\n\nMinutes before Ecke was attacked, according to the police, a group of four assailants had also assaulted a 28-year-old Green Party campaign worker while he was putting up posters in the same part of Dresden.\n\nAccording to a Green Party activist who had been with the politician at the time of the attack, he was punched several times before being kicked in the stomach and ribs while lying on the floor.\n\n\"He suffered injuries, mainly bruises,\" Anne-Katrin Haubold told Der Spiegel news magazine on Sunday. According to her account, the attack took place on Friday evening some time after 10 pm while they were putting up election posters in the district of Striesen.\n\nPolice assume that the same perpetrators are responsible for the attack on Ecke, which took place shortly afterwards.\n\nProtesters have called for demonstrations in Germany to denounce the attacks and defend Germany's democratic values.\n\nSome 3,000 people took to the streets in Dresden's Striesen district on Sunday afternoon to protest again violence and for democracy, according to police and organizers. SPD party leader Esken, German Culture Minister Claudia Roth from the Green Party and Saxony's state Justice Minister Katja Meier also joined the rally.\n\nIn Berlin, more than 1,000 demonstrators gathered at the German capital's iconic Brandenburger Gate, according to initial police estimates.\n\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, meanwhile, has reportedly sought an urgent meeting with her state-level colleagues to address added security measures to prevent further political violence in the lead up to June's European Parliament elections.\n\nThere have been several violent incidents during election campaigns across Germany, including on Thursday evening in the western German city of Essen, where a Green Party member of parliament, Kai Gehring, was attacked along with his fellow Green colleague Rolf Fliss after a party event.\n\nIn the western German town of Nordhorn, a politician from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was beaten at an information stand on Saturday morning, according to police reports.\n\nInterior ministers from Germany's 16 federal states are expected to convene next week to discuss the attacks. Faeser, a fellow member of the SPD, called for the meeting on Saturday, not long after police disclosed details of the assault on Ecke, the Tagesspiegel newspaper reported.\n\nThe Greens in the eastern state of Saxony have already reacted after other attacks last weekend in Chemnitz and Zwickau and are no longer sending their members to put up posters on their own. Other parties are now also making similar considerations and guidelines in the wake of the assault on Ecke.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz has called for united action against right-wing extremism.\n\n\"Democracy is threatened by something like this, and that is why shrugging our shoulders is never an option,\" Scholz said on Saturday evening. \"We must stand together against it.\"",

Leaders across Germany and the EU condemned the assault, and other attacks on politicians that have doubled in Germany since the 2019 European Parliament elections, according to government data published in January.\n\nA 17-year-old went to a police station on Saturday and said he was involved in the attack, police said. Officers then identified three more young men on Sunday, searched their homes and gathered evidence, police added. All four are German nationals aged 17 to 18, police said. The statement did not go into details on possible motives or say whether the teenagers were in custody.\n\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser promised \"tough action and further protective measures,\" in a statement on Saturday. \"We need more police presence on the ground, to protect democratic politicians at campaign stands and events,\" she was quoted as saying in an interview with the Rheinische Post.\n\nShe said a climate of violence was being stoked by hostile rhetoric from the far right. The heads of the SPD in Saxony, Henning Homann and Kathrin Michel, issued a statement blaming the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has seen a surge in support in the past year, taking it to second place in opinion polls nationwide.\n\nAfD co-leader Alice Weidel said attempts to use the attack on Ecke for political gains were \"vile and irresponsible\", noting AfD politicians and members were frequently attacked. Greens party politicians face the most aggression in Germany, according to the government data. Attacks on them have risen sevenfold since 2019 to 1,219 last year, the statistics released in January showed.\n\nAfD politicians faced the second-highest number of attacks with 478, and the SPD the third-highest with 420, according to the data. The AfD is particularly popular in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg, where surveys suggest it could come first in regional elections in September.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Ecke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matthias Ecke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dresden"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dresden"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxony", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Faeser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Faeser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alternative for Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinische_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rheinische Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandenburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandenburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuringia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thuringia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thuringia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Weidel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alice Weidel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_16_58_29_8149663.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539335", "eventUri": "eng-9539335", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Four individuals pounced on the 41-year-old politician and kicked and punched him.\n\nAccording to the Saxon branch of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), Ecke will have to undergo surgery. In its digital edition, Der Spiegel reported that the MEP is suffering from facial fractures and will be operated on tomorrow.\n\n\"Democracy is threatened by something like this and that's why shrugging off is never an option\", declared the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, a social democrat like the attacked politician. Scholz spoke like this yesterday afternoon at an SPD event in Berlin, and stressed that these events have to do with the speeches and moods that are created in the political sphere, in indirect allusion to the aggressive rhetoric of the ultra-right.\n\nOn the same Friday in Dresden, a 28-year-old Greens volunteer, who was also putting up posters, was beaten to death by four people, and the police suspect that they are the same assailants who attacked Ecke. In a statement, Els Verds explained that two teams pasting posters in the Saxon capital were \"attacked and threatened\", and that one person was injured.\n\nThe president of the Republic, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, also condemned the events and evoked other attacks against local deputies and politicians in recent days. On Thursday, two Greens elected officials were attacked in Essen, in western Germany, and one of them was hit in the face. The previous Saturday, dozens of demonstrators surrounded the car of the green Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt, vice president of the Bundestag (Lower House of Parliament), after a festive event in the east of the country, and police reinforcements had to be requested so that she could go away from the place\n\nYesterday, Steinmeier urged that \"the political discussion be carried out peacefully, with arguments and respect\", and called not to allow \"radicals to use brutality to destroy what democracies represent in electoral campaigns\".\n\nA police spokesman told Der Spiegel that Ecke's assailants, young men between the ages of 17 and 20, wore black, and that eyewitnesses described them as \"from the far-right spectrum.\" , although there is no official confirmation of the latter. \"If an attack for political reasons is confirmed a few weeks before the European elections, this serious act of violence also constitutes a serious attack on democracy\", stated the Minister of the Interior, also Social Democrat Nancy Faeser, in a statement . The minister invoked the responsibility of \"extremists and populists, who feed a climate of increasing violence through totally disproportionate verbal attacks\".\n\nThe Saxon SPD immediately pointed to the role in the political hostility of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, rising in the polls in this eastern German state, which will hold regional elections in September. \"The seeds sown by the AfD and other far-right groups are germinating; his supporters are now completely uninhibited,\" said Henning Homann and Kathrin Michel, leaders of the SPD in Saxony.\n\nFor his part, the co-president of the AfD, Tino Chrupalla, condemned on the social network X the attack on Matthias Ecke saying that \"electoral campaigns must be developed in a tough and constructive way, but without violence\".\n\nThe president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, posted a message to X declaring herself \"horrified\" by the \"merciless attack on MEP Matthias Ecke in Dresden\": \"All my support and solidarity. Those responsible must be brought to justice.\"", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

An SPD source said his injuries would require an operation.\n\nShortly before, what appeared to be the same group attacked a 28-year-old campaigner for the Greens, who was also putting up posters, police said, although his injuries were not as severe.\n\n\"Democracy is threatened by this kind of thing,\" Scholz told a convention of European socialists in Berlin.\n\nThe attacks exemplify increased violence in Germany in recent years, often from the far-right, targeting especially leftist politicians. The BfV domestic intelligence agency says far-right extremism is the biggest threat to German democracy.\n\nSaxony premier Michael Kretschmer, a conservative, said such aggression and attempts at intimidation recalled the darkest era of German history, a reference to Nazi rule.\n\nThe president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, a former German conservative minister, and the Italian head of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, both condemned the attack on Ecke.\n\n\"The culprits must be brought to account,\" von der Leyen said on X.\n\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser vowed \"tough action and further protective measures\" in response to the attacks.\n\nFAR-RIGHT SUPPORT\n\nThe heads of the SPD in Saxony, Henning Homann and Kathrin Michel, issued a statement in which they blamed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) for the rise in violence.\n\n\"These people and their supporters bear responsibility for what is happening in this country,\" they said.\n\nThe AfD did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The party says it is the victim of a campaign by the media and political establishment.\n\nThe AfD has seen a surge in support in the past year take it to second place in opinion polls nationwide. It is particularly strong in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg, where surveys suggest it could come first in regional elections in September.\n\nNationwide, the number of attacks on politicians of parties represented in parliament has doubled since 2019, according to government figures published in January.\n\nGreens party politicians face the most aggression, according to the data, with attacks on them rising sevenfold since 2019 to 1,219 last year. AfD politicians suffered 478 attacks and the SPD was third with 420.\n\nTheresa Ertel, a Greens candidate in municipal elections in Thuringia this month, said she knew of party members who no longer wanted to stand because of the aggressive political atmosphere.\n\nThe Greens in her region had agreed that information stands should always have at least three staff for extra safety.\n\n(Reporting

of violence'.\n\nThe lawmaker is currently the top candidate in Saxony for June's European Parliament election.\n\n'The attack on Matthias Ecke is an unmistakable alarm signal to all people in this country,' Henning Homann and Kathrin Michel, chairs of SPD's Saxony branch, said in the statement.\n\n'Our democratic values are under attack.'\n\nThe statement also claimed that there had been other attempts at intimidation and the destruction of posters, as German police continue their investigations into the attack.\n\nThe SDP pointed the finger at supporters of the far-right party Alliance for Germany (AfD) for the assault on Ecke.\n\n'Their supporters are now completely disinhibited and apparently see us democrats as fair game,' the statement said.\n\nFollowing the shocking incident, anti-far-right protests have erupted across Berlin as the group is also believed to have attacked a Green Party member who was also seen campaigning just minutes before attacking Ecke, reports DW.\n\nParticipants gather for a demonstration against the far right and to condemn attacks on politicians, at Pariser Platz square in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany on May 5, 2024\n\nA 17-year-old has turned himself in on early May 5, 2024 to police in Germany after an attack on a lawmaker in Dresden , that the country's leaders decried as a threat to democracy\n\nA participant displays a placard 'Dresden thugs - willing accomplices of (AfD politician Bjoern) Hoecke' during a demonstration against the far right and to condemn attacks on politicians\n\nPolice revealed a 28-year-old man putting up posters for the Greens had been 'punched' and 'kicked' on the same Dresden street.\n\nThe groups Zusammen gegen Rechts (Together against the right) and Wir sind die Brandmauer Dresden (We are the firewall Dresden) called for Sunday protests in Berlin and Dresden.\n\nAccording to initial police reports, over 1,000 people attended the demonstration at the Brandenburg Gate in solidarity with the injured SDP politician.\n\nThe Green Party chairmen Ricarda Lang and Omid Nouripour, SPD leader Lars Klingbeil, SPD General Secretary Kevin K\u00fchnert, as well as the Prime Ministers of Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia, Michael Kretschmer and Hendrik W\u00fcst, also appeared at the protest, local reports have stated.\n\nLast week, two Green deputies were verbally abused while campaigning in Essen, western Germany, and another was ambushed by several demonstrators in her car while in the east of the country.\n\nThe German Association of Cities have now called for tougher penalties for attacks on politicians.\n\n'We have to protect politically active people better,' said City Council President Markus Lewe to the D\u00fcsseldorf Rheinische Post.\n\nLewe demanded that attacks on politicians must be 'consistently pursued and punished' by the police and judiciary.\n\nAccording to the Tagesspiegel newspaper, the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, is planning to call a special conference with Germany's regional interior ministers next week to address violence against politicians.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

Four individuals pounced on the 41-year-old politician and kicked and punched him. According to the Saxon branch of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), Ecke will have to undergo surgery. In its digital edition, Der Spiegel reported that the MEP suffers fractures to his face and that he will undergo surgery on Monday.\n\n\"Democracy is threatened by something like this and that is why shrugging our shoulders is never an option,\" declared the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, a social democrat like the attacked politician. Scholz spoke this afternoon at an SPD event in Berlin, and stressed that these events have to do with the speeches and moods that are created in the political sphere, in indirect allusion to the aggressive rhetoric of the far right.\n\nOn the same Friday in Dresden, a 28-year-old Green volunteer, who was also putting up posters, was beaten by four people, and the police suspect that they are the same attackers who attacked Ecke. In a statement this Saturday, the Greens explained that two teams putting up posters in the Saxon capital were \"attacked and threatened\", and that one person was injured.\n\nThe President of the Republic, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, also condemned what happened and recalled other attacks against deputies and local politicians in recent days. On Thursday, two elected Green officials were attacked in Essen, western Germany, with one of them hit in the face. The previous Saturday, dozens of protesters surrounded the car of the green Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt, vice president of the Bundestag (lower house of Parliament), after a festive event in the east of the country, and police reinforcements had to be requested so that she could leave the place.\n\nPresident Steinmeier urged this Saturday that \"political discussion be developed peacefully, with arguments and respect,\" and called not to allow \"radicals to use brutality to destroy what represents democracies in electoral campaigns.\"\n\nA police spokesperson told Der Spiegel that Ecke's attackers, young men between 17 and 20 years old, were dressed in black, and that eyewitnesses described them as \"from the far-right spectrum,\" although the latter does not mean that. There is official confirmation. The investigation has been entrusted to the federal police, suggesting that the possibility of politically motivated violence is being investigated.\n\n\"If a politically motivated attack is confirmed a few weeks before the European elections, this serious act of violence also constitutes a serious attack on democracy,\" said the Minister of the Interior, also a social democrat Nancy Faeser, in a statement. The minister invoked the responsibility of \"extremists and populists, who fuel a climate of growing violence through totally disproportionate verbal attacks.\"\n\nThe Saxon SPD immediately pointed to the role in political hostility of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which is rising in the polls in this eastern German state, which will hold regional elections in September. \"The seeds sown by the AfD and other far-right groups are germinating; \"His supporters are now completely uninhibited and clearly regard us Democrats as a game,\" said Henning Homann and Kathrin Michel, SPD leaders in Saxony.\n\nFor his part, the co-president of the AfD, Tino Chrupalla, condemned the attack on Matthias Ecke on the social network\n\nThe president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, was horrified by the attack on the German candidate in the upcoming European elections. \"Horrified by the ruthless attack on MEP Matthias Ecke in Dresden. All my support and solidarity. Those responsible must be brought to justice. Matthias, the European Parliament is at your side,\" Metsola wrote on the social network X.\n\nMatthias Ecke has been a member of the European Parliament since 2022 and is running in the European elections on June 9 in tenth place on the SPD list and as the main candidate (Spitzenkandidat) of the Saxon branch of the party. He was previously a counselor in the Saxon regional Ministry of Economy. Born in the small town of Meerane, in the district of Zwickau, Ecke resides in Dresden with his wife and two daughters.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press

Police are still investigating the crime and have not identified suspects.\n\nThere have been several violent incidents during election campaigns across Germany, including on Thursday evening in the western German city of Essen, where the Green Party member of parliament Kai Gehring and his party colleague Rolf Fliss were attacked after a party event.\n\nIn the western German town of Nordhorn, a politician from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was beaten at an information stand on Saturday morning, according to police reports.\n\nTwo activist groups called for demonstrations on Sunday in both Dresden and Berlin to denounce the violence.\n\nInterior ministers from Germany's 16 federal states are expected to convene next week to discuss the attacks.

In a democracy, no one should be afraid to express their opinion,\" he wrote.\n\nOn Sunday the 17-year-old turned himself in to police in Dresden and said he carried out the attack.\n\nFollowing further investigations, three other suspects were identified on Sunday, their homes were searched and evidence seized, according to a joint statement from the police and prosecutors in Dresden.\n\nThe suspects are Germans aged 17 and 18, the statement said, adding the investigation was ongoing.\n\nThe teen who turned himself in on Sunday is considered the main suspect in the attack, according to German daily Bild.\n\nThe motive remains unclear and the suspects have not been taken into custody.\n\nPolice and prosecutors said there are indications that one of the suspects could be classified as far right.\n\nBut they stressed the crime itself is not currently classified as being motivated by far-right beliefs as the investigation is still ongoing.\n\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has racked up a string of successes at local polls over the past 12 months but has also been at the center of a series of scandals, including allegations of links to Russia and China.\n\nEcke, who is head of the SPD's European election list in the Saxony region, suffered several fractures to his face in the attack, according to his party.\n\nThe operation on the politician, who remains in hospital, went smoothly but the recovery will be long, it said.\n\nLatest target\n\nEcke was just the latest political target to be attacked in Germany.\n\nPolice said a 28-year-old man putting up posters for the Greens had been \"punched\" and \"kicked\" earlier in the evening on the same Dresden street.\n\nAuthorities suspect the same four people of carrying out the attack.\n\nIn the past two weeks, two Greens lawmakers were abused while campaigning in Essen in western Germany and another was surrounded by dozens of demonstrators in her car in the east of the country.\n\nOn Sunday, thousands of people attended demonstrations in solidarity with Ecke in Dresden and Berlin.\n\nThe issue of increasing political violence will feature at a special conference Tuesday involving Interior Minister Nancy Faeser and regional interior ministers, the government said.\n\n\"It is now urgently necessary to further increase the protection of democratic forces in our country,\" an interior ministry spokesman told a news briefing in Berlin.\n\nHe said a stronger police presence and more protection for parties was needed in the run-up to June's European elections, as well three key state elections in Germany later this year in which the AfD is forecast to perform strongly.\n\nAccording to provisional police figures, 2,790 crimes were committed against politicians in Germany in 2023.\n\nThat was more that the 1,806 recorded the previous year but fewer than the 2,840 registered in 2021, when legislative elections took place.", "source": {"uri": "courthousenews.com",

A surge in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) over the past year has taken it to second place in nationwide polls.\n\nThe AfD is particularly strong in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg. Surveys suggest it will come first in regional elections in all three this September.\n\n[ Leading far-right politician goes on trial in Germany charged with using Nazi slogan ]\n\nGreens party politicians face the most aggression, according to the government data, with attacks on them rising sevenfold since 2019 to 1,219 last year. AfD politicians suffered 478 attacks and the SPD was third with 420.\n\nTheresa Ertel, a Greens candidate in municipal elections in Thuringia this month, said she knew of party members who no longer wanted to stand because of the aggressive political atmosphere.\n\nThe Greens in her region had agreed that information stands should always have at least three staff for extra safety. - Reporting by

But they will never succeed,\" Esken and Klingbein said in a statement on Saturday.\n\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, also a member of the SPD, said that if authorities confirm that the attack on Ecke was politically motivated, \"then this serious act of violence is also a serious attack on democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyfinland.fi", "dataType": "news", "title": "clickittefaq"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxony", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dresden"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dresden"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Ecke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthias Ecke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States of Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Faeser", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Faeser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskia_Esken", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saskia Esken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democratic_Union_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Democratic Union of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kretschmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Kretschmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Klingbeil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lars Klingbeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weimar Republic"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alternative for Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.dailyfinland.fi/assets/news_photos/2024/05/04/image-37560-1714843273.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539335", "eventUri": "eng-9539335", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

An SPD source said his injuries would require an operation.\n\nShortly before, what appeared to be the same group attacked a 28-year-old campaigner for the Greens, who was also putting up posters, police said, although his injuries were not as severe.\n\n\"Democracy is threatened by this kind of thing,\" Scholz told a convention of European socialists in Berlin.\n\nThe attacks exemplify increased violence in Germany in recent years, often from the far-right, targeting especially leftist politicians. The BfV domestic intelligence agency says far-right extremism is the biggest threat to German democracy.\n\nSaxony premier Michael Kretschmer, a conservative, said such aggression and attempts at intimidation recalled the darkest era of German history, a reference to Nazi rule.\n\nThe president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, a former German conservative minister, and the Italian head of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, both condemned the attack on Ecke.\n\n\"The culprits must be brought to account,\" von der Leyen said on X.\n\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser vowed \"tough action and further protective measures\" in response to the attacks.\n\nFAR-RIGHT SUPPORT\n\nThe heads of the SPD in Saxony, Henning Homann and Kathrin Michel, issued a statement in which they blamed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) for the rise in violence.\n\n\"These people and their supporters bear responsibility for what is happening in this country,\" they said.\n\nThe AfD did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The party says it is the victim of a campaign by the media and political establishment.\n\nThe AfD has seen a surge in\n\nsupport in the past year take it to second place in opinion polls nationwide. It is particularly strong in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg, where surveys suggest it could come first in regional elections in September.\n\nNationwide, the number of attacks on politicians of parties represented in parliament has doubled since 2019, according to government figures published in January.\n\nGreens party politicians face the most aggression, according to the data, with attacks on them rising sevenfold since 2019 to 1,219 last year. AfD politicians suffered 478 attacks and the SPD was third with 420.\n\nTheresa Ertel, a Greens candidate in municipal elections in Thuringia this month, said she knew of party members who no longer wanted to stand because of the aggressive political atmosphere.\n\nThe Greens in her region had agreed that information stands should always have at least three staff for extra safety.

In a democracy, no one should be afraid to express their opinion,\" he wrote.\n\nOn Sunday the 17-year-old turned himself in to police in Dresden and said he carried out the attack.\n\nFollowing further investigations, three other suspects were identified on Sunday, their homes were searched and evidence seized, according to a joint statement from the police and prosecutors in Dresden.\n\nThe suspects are Germans aged 17 and 18, the statement said, adding the investigation was ongoing.\n\nThe teen who turned himself in on Sunday is considered the main suspect in the attack, according to German daily Bild.\n\nThe motive remains unclear and the suspects have not been taken into custody.\n\nPolice and prosecutors said there are indications that one of the suspects could be classified as far right.\n\nBut they stressed the crime itself is not currently classified as being motivated by far-right beliefs as the investigation is still ongoing.\n\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has racked up a string of successes at local polls over the past 12 months but has also been at the centre of a series of scandals, including allegations of links to Russia and China.\n\nEcke, who is head of the SPD's European election list in the Saxony region, suffered several fractures to his face in the attack, according to his party.\n\nThe operation on the politician, who remains in hospital, went smoothly but the recovery will be long, it said.\n\n- Latest target -\n\nEcke was just the latest political target to be attacked in Germany.\n\nPolice said a 28-year-old man putting up posters for the Greens had been \"punched\" and \"kicked\" earlier in the evening on the same Dresden street.\n\nAuthorities suspect the same four people of carrying out the attack.\n\nIn the past two weeks, two Greens lawmakers were abused while campaigning in Essen in western Germany and another was surrounded by dozens of demonstrators in her car in the east of the country.\n\nOn Sunday, thousands of people attended demonstrations in solidarity with Ecke in Dresden and Berlin.\n\nThe issue of increasing political violence will feature at a special conference Tuesday involving Interior Minister Nancy Faeser and regional interior ministers, the government said.\n\n\"It is now urgently necessary to further increase the protection of democratic forces in our country,\" an interior ministry spokesman told a press briefing in Berlin.\n\nHe said a stronger police presence and more protection for parties was needed in the run-up to June's European elections, as well three key state elections in Germany later this year in which the AfD is forecast to perform strongly.\n\nAccording to provisional police figures, 2,790 crimes were committed against politicians in Germany in 2023.\n\nThat was more that the 1,806 recorded the previous year but fewer than the 2,840 registered in 2021, when legislative elections took place.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com",

Sunday's protests were called to counter rising right-wing extremism and violence.\n\nThousands of demonstrators gathered in the streets of Dresden and Berlin on Sunday to protest right-wing extremism and political violence following Friday's attack on the Social Democrat (SPD) lawmaker Matthias Ecke, a member of the European Parliament.\n\nEcke was assaulted in Dresden while hanging up posters ahead of June's European parliamentary elections. He was beaten so severely that he required emergency surgery and remains hospitalized.\n\n\"It is very clear that this willingness to use violence did not occur in a vacuum,\" said SPD co-chair Saskia Esken before the Sunday demonstrations.\n\nPolice said roughly 1,000 people gathered in front of Berlin's famous Brandenburg Gate to voice support for democracy and stand against right-wing extremism.\n\nIn Dresden, police and organizers estimated the number of participants to be around 3,000.\n\nAddressing the crowd in Dresden, Esken said far-right parties sowing discontent and contempt for democracy were to blame for a recent spate of incidents involving verbal and physical attacks on politicians.\n\n\"In this respect, these people who have threatened to hunt us down, to clean up this country, to muck it out, also share responsibility for the social climate in which such acts are possible,\" said Esken; who was joined by Federal Culture Minister Claudia Roth and Saxony Justice Minister Katja Meier, both of the Green Party.\n\nThe protests were initiated by the groups Zusammen gegen Rechts (Together Against the Right) in Berlin, and Wir sind die Brandmauer Dresden (We Are the Firewall Dresden) in Dresden.\n\nPolice in Dresden said Matthias Ecke was first verbally attacked and then physically beaten on Friday evening by a group of four young males whom eyewitnesses said appeared to have ranged in age from about 17 to 20.\n\nOne suspect, a 17-year-old, turned himself in on Sunday.\n\nEyewitnesses also told police that the perpetrators had been dressed in dark clothing and appeared to be part of the far-right scene.\n\nJust minutes before attacking Ecke, the group is also believed to have beaten a Green Party staffer hanging campaign posters in the same neighborhood.\n\nFar-right and extremist groups and political parties, chiefly among them Alternative for Germany (AfD), have a strong base in many eastern German states, including Saxony.\n\nThe AfD has soared in the polls to become the second most popular party in Germany after the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU). The party is also leading polls ahead of Saxony's state election later this year.\n\nHowever, the AfD's rise and support for far-right policies have also triggered counter-demonstrations and sparked a discussion over the possibility of banning the party.\n\nLast year, AfD members were among those attending a meeting of far-right and neo-Nazi extremists in Potsdam, outside Berlin, where attendees discussed deporting immigrants and, in some cases, German citizens.\n\nThe publication of reports by the investigative journalism group Correctiv detailing the Potsdam meeting sparked nationwide protests against the far-right this January.\n\nThe AfD has long been under surveillance by Germany's domestic intelligence service on suspicion that it may be a right-wing extremist organization, but according to German media reports the agency could soon designate AfD a \"definite extremist endeavor.\"\n\nFederal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has called for a meeting with her state-level colleagues to discuss the rise of political violence across Germany in the run-up to the EU elections.\n\n\"The constitutional state must and will react to this with a tough approach and further protective measures for the democratic forces in our country,\" she said on Saturday.\n\nThough the assault on Ecke is perhaps the most high-profile case of political violence of late, it is certainly not the only one, as several other political campaigners have also been attacked in recent weeks.\n\nOn Thursday, for instance, German parliamentarian Kai Gehring and local politician Rolf Fliss, both Greens, were attacked in the western city of Essen following a campaign event.\n\nThe Greens have in fact stopped sending out party affiliates to hang up posters on their own in the cities of Chemnitz and Zwickau in Saxony after a series of attacks last weekend.\n\nFabian Funke, who like Ecke is a member of the Social Democrats, spoke with DW about recent attacks on politicians in Germany and the threat they pose to democracy.\n\n\"We see that these hostile attacks on people during election campaigns are rising,\" he said. \"I think this is really a dangerous time, also for the state of our democracy.\"\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) also denounced what he called the \"threat\" posed by far-right political violence.\n\n\"Democracy is threatened by this kind of act,\" Scholz told a congress of European socialist parties in Berlin, saying such attacks result from, \"the atmosphere created by the discourse of pitting people against each other.\"\n\n\"We must never accept such violence... we must oppose it together,\" Scholz said.\n\nOutside Germany, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell also commented on the attacks, saying, \"We're witnessing unacceptable episodes of harassment against political representatives, and growing far-right extremism that reminds us of dark times of the past.\"\n\njs,ab/sms (dpa, AFP)", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news",

The German intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, domestic intelligence agency says far-right extremism is the biggest threat to German democracy.\n\nSaxony Minister President Michael Kretschmer said such aggression and attempts at intimidation recalled the darkest era of German history, a reference to Nazi rule.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, a former German minister, and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola both condemned the attack on Ecke.\n\n\"The culprits must be brought to account,\" Von der Leyen wrote on X.\n\nGerman Minister of the Interior Nancy Faeser vowed \"tough action and further protective measures\" in response to the attacks.\n\nThe heads of the Social Democratic Party in Saxony, Henning Homann and Kathrin Michel, issued a statement in which they blamed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party for the rise in violence.\n\n\"These people and their supporters bear responsibility for what is happening in this country,\" they said.\n\nThe AfD did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The party says it is the victim of a campaign by the media and political establishment.\n\nThe AfD has seen a surge in support in the past year take it to second place in opinion polls nationwide.

Officers then identified three more young men on Sunday, searched their homes and gathered evidence, police added.\n\nAll four are German nationals aged 17 to 18, police said. The statement did not go into details on possible motives or say whether the teenagers were in custody.\n\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser promised \"tough action and further protective measures,\" in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\"We need more police presence on the ground, to protect democratic politicians at campaign stands and events,\" she was quoted as saying in an interview with the Rheinische Post.\n\nShe said a climate of violence was being stoked by hostile rhetoric from the far right.\n\nThe heads of the SPD in Saxony, Henning Homann and Kathrin Michel, issued a statement blaming the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which has seen a surge in support in the past year, taking it to second place in opinion polls nationwide.\n\nAfD co-leader Alice Weidel said attempts to use the attack on Ecke for political gains were \"vile and irresponsible\", noting AfD politicians and members were frequently attacked.\n\nGreens party politicians face the most aggression in Germany, according to the government data. Attacks on them have risen sevenfold since 2019 to 1,219 last year, the statistics released in January showed.\n\nAfD politicians faced the second-highest number of attacks with 478, and the SPD the third-highest with 420, according to the data.\n\nThe AfD is particularly popular in the eastern states of Saxony, Thuringia and Brandenburg, where surveys suggest it could come first in regional elections in September.\n\n(Reporting by Sarah Marsh, Holger Hansen and Rachel More; Editing by Andrew Heavens)", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dresden"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dresden"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxony", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Faeser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Faeser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinische_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rheinische Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alternative for Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandenburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandenburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuringia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thuringia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thuringia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Weidel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alice Weidel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/5e11eba70bbb7bceac8c410c3fea72f2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539335", "eventUri": "eng-9539335", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Government and opposition parties say their members and supporters have faced a wave of physical and verbal attacks in recent months and have called on police to step up protection for politicians and election rallies.Many of the incidents have taken place in the former communist east of the country, where Scholzs government is deeply unpopular.\n\nA candidate for Chancellor Olaf Scholz's centre-left party in next month's election for the European Parliament was beaten up and seriously injured while campaigning in an eastern city, the party said Saturday. It was the latest in a series of incidents of violence and harassment raising political tensions in Germany ahead of the polls. Scholz's Social Democrats, or SPD, launched their official campaign for the June 9 vote with a rally last week in Hamburg, Scholz's longtime home city. Matthias Ecke, an SPD candidate, was attacked while putting up posters in Dresden on Friday evening, the party said. It said he was taken to a hospital and required surgery for his injuries. Police said the 41-year-old was beaten by four men and that the same group had apparently attacked a Greens party worker minutes before in the same street.\n\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser, who is also a Social Democrat, said that if it's proven that the assault on Ecke was politically motivated, it would represent \"a serious attack on democracy.\" \"We are experiencing a new dimension of anti-democratic violence,\" Faeser said. She promised \"tougher action and further protective measures for the democratic forces in our country.\" Government and opposition parties say their members and supporters have faced a wave of physical and verbal attacks in recent months and have called on police to step up protection for politicians and election rallies.\n\nMany of the incidents have taken place in the former communist east of the country, where Scholz's government is deeply unpopular. The far-right and anti-establishment Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, is expected to make big gains across the region in both the European elections and in German state elections in the fall.\n\nLast week, the car carrying the vice president of the German parliament, Katrin Goering-Eckardt of the Greens, was surrounded for nearly an hour by protesters as she tried to leave a rally. The opposition Christian Democrats and The Left party say their workers have also faced intimidation and seen their posters ripped down.\n\nMainstream parties accuse the AfD of links to violent neo-Nazi groups and of fomenting an increasingly harsh political climate. A prominent AfD leader, Bjoern Hoecke, is currently on trial accused of using a banned Nazi slogan. Germany's domestic intelligence service has placed some chapters of the party under surveillance.\n\nThe branch of the Social Democrats in Saxony state, where Ecke is their lead candidate for the European elections, said their campaign would go on despite \"fascist methods\" of intimidation.\n\n\"The seeds that the AfD and other right-wing extremists have sown are germinating,\" the branch leaders, Henning Homann und Kathrin Michel, said in a joint statement. ''These people and their supporters carry responsibility for what is happening in this country.\" Tino Chrupalla, co-chair of the AfD, said his party ''deeply condemns physical attacks against politicians of all parties. Election campaigns must be tough and constructive in terms of content, but without violence,\" he said in a social media post.\n\nThe AfD, whose rallies often draw counter-demonstrations, says its members also suffer attacks and harassment.\n\nOn Saturday, police said they detained a man who hit and slightly injured a state lawmaker for the AfD as he was campaigning in Norden, a town near Germany's North Sea coast. The assailant also pelted the lawmaker with eggs.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com",

Police also said the group members had been dressed in dark clothing and appeared to be part of the far-right scene.\n\nThe same group is also believed to have attacked a Green Party member who was also campaigning just minutes before attacking Eck.\n\nEcke required an urgent operation after the incident.\n\nThe groups Zusammen gegen Rechts (Together against the right) and Wir sind die Brandmauer Dresden (We are the firewall Dresden) called for spontaneous Sunday protests in Berlin and Dresden, respectively.\n\nFar-right and extremist groups and political parties, chiefly among them the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, have a strong base in many eastern German states, including Saxony.\n\nThe AfD has soared in the polls to become the second most popular party in Germany after the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU). The party is also leading polls ahead of Saxony's state election later this year,\n\nHowever, the AfD's rise and support for far-right policies also triggered counter-demonstrations and sparked a discussion over the option of banning the party.\n\nAfD members also attended a meeting last year of far-right and neo-Nazi extremists in Potsdam, outside Berlin, where attendees discussed deporting immigrants and, in some cases, German citizens. Reports detailing the meeting by the group Correctiv sparked nationwide protests against the far-right.\n\nGermany's domestic intelligence service has had the AfD under surveillance as a suspected case of right-wing extremism, but according to German media reports it could soon designate the party as a \"definite extremist endeavor.\"\n\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser has called for a meeting with her state-level colleagues to discuss the rise of political violence in the run-up to the EU elections.\n\n\"The constitutional state must and will react to this with a tough approach and further protective measures for the democratic forces in our country,\" she said on Saturday.\n\nThe assault on Ecke is the most high-profile case, but other political campaigners have also been attacked in recent weeks.\n\nKai Gehring, a Green Party member of the German parliament, was attacked in the western city of Essen on Thursday following a party event.\n\nThe Greens have also stopped sending out party affiliates on their own to hang up posters in the cities of Chemnitz and Zwickau in Saxony after a series of attacks last weekend.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz, SPD, denounced the \"threat\" posed by far-right political violence.\n\n\"Democracy is threatened by this kind of act,\" Scholz told a congress of European socialist parties in Berlin, saying such attacks result from \"discourse, the atmosphere created from pitting people against each other.\"\n\n\"We must never accept such acts of violence... we must oppose it together,\" Scholz said.\n\nThe EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, also commented on the attacks, \"We're witnessing unacceptable episodes of harassment against political representatives and growing far-right extremism that reminds us of dark times of the

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nA candidate for Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left party in next month's election for the European Parliament was beaten up and seriously injured while campaigning in an eastern city, the party said Saturday.\n\nIt was the latest in a series of incidents of violence and harassment raising political tensions in Germany ahead of the polls. Scholz's Social Democrats, or SPD, launched their official campaign for the June 9 vote with a rally last week in Hamburg, Scholz's longtime home city.\n\nMatthias Ecke, an SPD candidate, was attacked while putting up posters in Dresden on Friday evening, the party said. It said he was taken to a hospital and required surgery for his injuries. Police said the 41-year-old was beaten by four men and that the same group had apparently attacked a Greens party worker minutes before in the same street.\n\nInterior Minister Nancy Faeser, who is also a Social Democrat, said that if it's proven that the assault on Ecke was politically motivated, it would represent \"a serious attack on democracy.\"\n\n\"We are experiencing a new dimension of anti-democratic violence,\" Faeser said. She promised \"tougher action and further protective measures for the democratic forces in our country.\"\n\nGovernment and opposition parties say their members and supporters have faced a wave of physical and verbal attacks in recent months and have called on police to step up protection for politicians and election rallies.\n\nMany of the incidents have taken place in the former communist east of the country, where Scholz's government is deeply unpopular. The far-right and anti-establishment Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, is expected to make big gains across the region in both the European elections and in German state elections in the fall.\n\nLast week, the car carrying the vice president of the German parliament, Katrin Goering-Eckardt of the Greens, was surrounded for nearly an hour by protesters as she tried to leave a rally. The opposition Christian Democrats and The Left party say their workers have also faced intimidation and seen their posters ripped down.\n\nMainstream parties accuse the AfD of links to violent neo-Nazi groups and of fomenting an increasingly harsh political climate. A prominent AfD leader, Bjoern Hoecke, is currently on trial accused of using a banned Nazi slogan. Germany's domestic intelligence service has placed some chapters of the party under surveillance.\n\nThe branch of the Social Democrats in Saxony state, where Ecke is their lead candidate for the European elections, said their campaign would go on despite \"fascist methods\" of intimidation.\n\n\"The seeds that the AfD and other right-wing extremists have sown are germinating,\" the branch leaders, Henning Homann und Kathrin Michel, said in a joint statement. \"These people and their supporters carry responsibility for what is happening in this country.\"\n\nTino Chrupalla, co-chair of the AfD, said his party \"deeply condemns physical attacks against politicians of all parties. Election campaigns must be tough and constructive in terms of content, but without violence,\" he said in a social media post.\n\nThe AfD, whose rallies often draw counter-demonstrations, says its members also suffer attacks and harassment.\n\nOn Saturday, police said they detained a man who hit and slightly injured a state lawmaker for the AfD as he was campaigning in Norden, a town near Germany's North Sea coast. The assailant also pelted the lawmaker with eggs.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alternative for Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Ecke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthias Ecke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dresden"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dresden"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hamburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Faeser", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Faeser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_to_the_European_Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elections to the European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-establishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-establishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundestag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundestag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States of Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tino_Chrupalla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tino Chrupalla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democrats_(Sweden)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Democrats (Sweden)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_(Germany)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Left (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxony", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/04/17/Germany_Politics_25089.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539335", "eventUri": "eng-9539335", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 551, "textEnd": 557}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

the assault.\n\nMatthias Ecke, 41, from Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), was set upon by four attackers as he put up European election posters in the eastern city of Dresden on Friday night, according to police.\n\nHe needed an operation for injuries sustained in the attack, which was denounced by Scholz as a threat to democracy.\n\nOn Sunday, a 17-year-old turned himself in to police in Dresden and told them he was \"the perpetrator who had knocked down the SPD politician,\" according to officers.\n\nFollowing further investigations, three other suspects were identified on Sunday, their homes were searched and evidence seized, according to a joint statement from the police and prosecutors in Dresden.\n\nThe suspects are German men aged 17 and 18, the statement said.\n\n\"The investigation is ongoing and will take some time,\" it added.\n\nThe teen who turned himself in on Sunday is considered the main suspect in the attack, according to German daily Bild.\n\nThe motive remains unclear and the suspects have not been taken into custody, although this may change once more details of the case have been established, the paper said.\n\nEcke, who is head of the SPD's European election list in the Saxony region, was the latest political target to be attacked in Germany.\n\nPolice said a 28-year-old man putting up posters for the Greens had been \"punched\" and \"kicked\" earlier in the evening on the same Dresden street.\n\nPolice suspect the same four people of carrying out the attack.\n\nIn the past week, two Greens lawmakers were abused while campaigning in Essen in western Germany and another was surrounded by dozens of demonstrators in her car in the east of the country.\n\nAccording to provisional police figures, 2,790 crimes were

The SPD reported that the incident occurred on Friday evening as Ecke was engaged in putting up campaign posters. The attack necessitated hospitalization and surgery for the injuries sustained. This violent act is part of a worrying trend of harassment and aggression that has been intensifying in the lead-up to the European Parliament elections scheduled for June 9.\n\nAccording to police reports, Ecke, aged 41, was attacked by four men who had allegedly assaulted a worker from the Greens party shortly before in the same vicinity. This series of attacks has sparked a nationwide concern over the safety of political campaigners and the broader implications for democratic processes in Germany. Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, also from the SPD, highlighted the gravity of the situation by stating that if the assault on Ecke is confirmed to be politically motivated, it would signify \"a serious attack on democracy.\" Faeser has vowed for \"tougher action and further protective measures\" to safeguard democratic institutions and individuals in the country.\n\nThe backdrop to these incidents is a growing unease with the political climate in Germany, especially in its former communist east where Scholz's government faces significant unpopularity. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is anticipated to capitalize on this discontent, expecting substantial gains in both the European and upcoming German state elections. Recent months have seen an uptick in confrontations involving members and supporters from various political spectrums, prompting calls for enhanced security measures at political events and for those involved in campaigning.\n\nMainstream parties have accused the AfD of nurturing an environment conducive to political violence through its alleged connections with neo-Nazi factions. A notable instance being Bjoern Hoecke, a leading figure within the AfD, who is currently undergoing trial for purportedly employing a prohibited Nazi slogan. In response to these accusations and the prevailing hostile atmosphere, Saxony's SPD branch has resolved to continue their campaign efforts despite facing what they describe as \"fascist methods\" of intimidation.\n\nIn a statement addressing the violence, Tino Chrupalla, co-chair of the AfD, expressed his party's strong condemnation of physical attacks against politicians from any party.

He was operated on on Sunday and the SPD's leader in Saxony, Henning Homann, said Ecke was \"doing well under the circumstances\".\n\nTwo of the suspectes have been identified by their first names and first initial of their surname, as is common practice in Germany, as Quentin J, 17, who appeared at a police station in southern Dresden on Sunday accompanied by his mother, and Leander H, also 17.\n\nLeander H was confronted by police on Sunday evening who went to his home in the east of the city with a search warrant. All four addresses where the youths lived were searched by police, who gathered evidence at the scene as well as removing objects from the homes.\n\nIn a statement, the state prosecutor, Sabine Wylegalla, said: \"The four accused are young men of German nationality aged 17 and 18 respectively. The investigation is ongoing and will take some time.\"\n\nThousands of people on Sunday took to the streets of several German cities, most notably Dresden and Berlin, to condemn the violent attack, amid an increase in the number of assaults on politicians in recent months, and a doubling of attacks since the 2019 European parliament elections, according to government data.\n\nThe attack has been roundly condemned by politicians across the political divide in Germany and the EU, sparking demands for an increase in both security for politicians and harsher penalties for perpetrators of attacks.\n\nThe motive for the attack remains unclear. None of the teenagers has so far spoken, according to police, who have said they are being investigated for grievous bodily harm. It has been widely reported that they had been drunk at the time of the attack.\n\nAs all four suspects are registered at a permanent address, they are not being taken into custody, although investigators said this could change once further circumstances were determined.\n\nSpeaking on Saturday, Nancy Faeser, the federal interior minister, blamed the far right for stoking a climate of violence with hate-filled rhetoric, including on social media.\n\nShe pledged to take \"tough action and further preventative and protective measures\", adding that a greater visible police presence was required on the ground at political events.\n\n\"We need more police presence on the ground, to protect democratic politicians at campaign stands and events,\" she told the Rheinische Post in an interview.\n\nOther politicians, including Markus S\u00f6der, the head of Bavaria's Christian Social Union, specifically pointed the finger of blame at the far-right populist Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD), which has been rising in the polls for the past year.\n\nThe co-chair of the Social Democrats, Saskia Esken, warned against playing down the attack on Ecke as a one-off act of wayward youths.\n\n\"It is very clear that this willingness to use violence hasn't come out of nowhere,\" Esken said at a solidarity rally on Sunday at the SPD state headquarters in Dresden. \"This has to do with the seeds of social division and messages of contempt for democracy that come from the AfD and other rightwing extremists.\n\n\"In this regard, these people who have threatened to hunt us down, to clean up and even to clear out this country, also share responsibility for the social climate in which such acts are possible,\" she said, calling on wider society, as well as political parties, to condemn the attack.\n\nThe AfD's co-leader Alice Weidel condemned as \"vile and irresponsible\" what she said were attempts to exploit the attack on Ecke for political gain, saying that AfD politicians and party members were frequently attacked.\n\nIn Dresden and Berlin, participants at rallies held up placards reading: \"No space for hate\", and \"Our democracy will not be intimidated\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kate_connolly@theguardian.com", "name": "Kate Connolly", "type": "author",

Matthias Ecke, candidate for the European elections on June 9, was attacked on Friday night in Dresden while posting election posters and is seriously injured. Four individuals pounced on the 41-year-old politician and kicked and punched him.\n\nAccording to the newspaper Bild, the young man who turned himself in went to the police station accompanied by his mother.

Associations against the extreme right have called for demonstrations this Sunday afternoon: in Dresden at 5 p.m. in the central Pohlandplatz, which is scheduled to be attended by the co-president of the SPD, Saskia Esken; and in Berlin at 6 p.m. in front of the Brandenburg Gate.\n\nAccording to the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser plans to call a special conference with regional Interior officials to address violence against elected officials. According to provisional police figures, 2,790 crimes were committed against political representatives in Germany in 2023, compared to 1,806 recorded the previous year. However, the record occurred in 2021, when there were legislative elections, when there were 2,840 crimes of this type.\n\nOn the same Friday in Dresden, a 28-year-old Green volunteer, who was also putting up posters, was beaten by four people, and the police suspect that they are the same attackers who attacked Ecke. In a statement, the Greens explained that two teams putting up posters in the Saxon capital were \"attacked and threatened\", and that one person was injured.

This included the recent assault on European Parliament candidate Matthias Ecke, who was hospitalized on Friday. One of his attackers surrendered to police custody on Sunday.\n\nEcke, 41, is a European Parliament member for the Social Democrat Party (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands). He was attacked on Saturday while hanging up posters ahead of June's European Parliament elections by four men and was seriously injured, requiring surgery. Investigators said a political motive was suspected. A 17-year-old turned himself early Sunday morning, confessing to the crime.\n\nScholz spoke out against the violence in a press conference, saying, \"We must never allow ourselves to become comfortable with acts of violence like these.\" He continued, \"Democracy is threatened by acts like these, which is why shrugging them off is never an option. We must stand up together.\" Many other European Parliament candidates and members have also expressed sympathy and outrage, including Roberta Metsola, the President of the European Parlaiment.\n\nThis was only the most recent in a series of attacks on politicians in Germany. The police have confirmed that a 28-year-old man had been \"punched\" and \"kicked\" while putting up posters earlier in the day on the same street that Ecke was attacked on. It is believed that this attack was by the same group.\n\nSeveral commentators have noted that the attacks have primarily targeted left-wing politicians and suspect a far-right motive. Extremist parties, primarily the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, have risen in popularity in recent years. They are now the second most popular party in Germany after the Christian Democrats. The Saxony Social Democrat branch has blamed the AfD for the attacks: \"Their supporters are now completely disinhibited and apparently see us democrats as fair game.\" The AfD have responded that they are the victim of a hate campaign by the media and political establishment.", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elisabeth_driscoll@jurist.org", "name": "Elisabeth Driscoll", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Ecke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matthias Ecke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_(Romania)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party (Romania)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Democrats_(Sweden)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Democrats (Sweden)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberta_Metsola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roberta Metsola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alternative for Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saxony", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saxony"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Posters", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/Posters", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.jurist.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/Olaf_Scholz_14271189360.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539335", "eventUri": "eng-9539335", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The investigation into the other suspects, so far unknown, that the witnesses mentioned, continues,\" the Saxon police reported yesterday on the X social network.\n\nEcke, 41, candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) - the formation of Chancellor Olaf Scholz - in the European elections on June 9, is hospitalized with facial fractures and will undergo surgery today.\n\nThe attack has aroused indignation and concern in equal parts in Germany, as it presents characteristics of violence for political reasons. Several parties attribute it to the climate triggered by the aggressive verbal virulence of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) formation.\n\nFor this reason, federations of associations against the extreme right called demonstrations yesterday afternoon: one in Dresden in the central Pohlandplatz, which was attended by the co-chair of the SPD, Saskia Esken, and another in Berlin in front of the door of Brandenburg.\n\nAbout three thousand people marched in Dresden and another thousand demonstrated in Berlin, according to estimates by the police in the respective cities. The demonstrators in Dresden carried banners with slogans such as: \"Democracy lives here\"; \"Nazis kill\" or \"Never again is now\". In Berlin, among other phrases, one of the banners said: \"In unity, justice and freedom there is no place for Nazis\".\n\nMeanwhile, the investigation into the attack continues. \"On May 5, 2024, at approximately one in the morning, a young man (17 years old, German) presented himself at the Dresden-South police station and declared that he was the perpetrator who had assaulted the politician of the SPD\", the Regional Criminal Investigation Office (LKA) of the federal state of Saxony reported in a statement. According to the Bild newspaper, the young man went to the police station accompanied by his mother. The suspect is not in pre-trial detention because he is a minor, has a permanent address and has surrendered voluntarily. \"He admitted the act, but did not go further,\" said police spokeswoman Silvaine Reiche.\n\nThe Greens volunteer attacked in Dresden also on Friday by four young men, when he was also pasting election posters, suffered minor injuries. \"Thank God he was not as badly injured as Mr. Ecke and was able to return home after receiving outpatient treatment from the emergency services,\" said Valentin Lippmann, a Green member of the Saxon Parliament. The police suspect that they are the same assailants who attacked Matthias Ecke.\n\nRecently there have been other attacks or cornerings: one or two environmentalist local officials in Essen, in western Germany, who were beaten, and another against the also environmentalist Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt, vice president of the Bundestag (Lower House of Parliament), whose car was surrounded after an event in the east of the country.\n\nAccording to the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, the Minister of the Interior, Social Democrat Nancy Faeser, plans to convene a conference with regional Interior officials to address violence against elected officials. According to provisional police figures, 2,790 crimes were committed against political representatives in 2023, compared to 1,806 the previous year. However, the record took place in 2021, when legislative elections were held and there were 2,840 crimes of this kind.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press

He sustained serious head injuries and had to undergo surgery. Shortly before, the same group is suspected of attacking and injuring a 28-year-old Green Party campaign worker.\n\nAll indications are that the attackers were right-wing extremists. A witness confirmed this. The police kept a low profile. Although a 17-year-old youth accompanied by his mother contacted them the following night and confessed to the offence, they did not comment on the motive for the attack. They released the teenager, saying there was no danger of him going into hiding. He had apparently refused to give the names of his accomplices. According to press reports, the police are still searching for persons unknown.\n\nThe attack on Ecke was preceded by a significant increase in right-wing extremist violence. In Saxony alone, there were 248 right-wing motivated attacks last year, 21 percent more than in 2022. At least 380 victims were affected. The fact that politicians from Chancellor Scholz's party, the SPD, are now also being brutally attacked shows that the right-wing extremist thugs will stop at nothing.\n\nView post on TikTok\n\nThe Sozialistische Gleichheitspartei (Socialist Equality Party, SGP) condemns the attack on Ecke. In a video recorded on the fringes of a demonstration at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Gregor Kahl, who is standing for the SGP in the European elections, says: \"The SGP condemns the violent right-wing extremist attack on Ecke and members of the Green Party in the strongest possible terms. The fact that the fascists can act so aggressively shows how far the fascist danger has progressed in Germany.\"\n\nThe attack on the SPD politician raises the question: How could it come to this?\n\nThe political responsibility for the arrogant behaviour of the far right lies with the governing parties -- the SPD, Greens and Liberal Democrats (FDP), who form the federal government in Germany, and the Christian Democrats (CDU), Greens and SPD who form the state government in Saxony. They have covered up and strengthened the extreme right, adopted its policies to a large extent and normalised social barbarism.\n\nThe federal government is investing huge sums in armaments to make Germany \"fit for war\" again; and is working in Ukraine with an ultra-right regime that bans socialist parties and worships Nazi collaborators, and insists on defeating Russia militarily, even if it means risking a nuclear war. The German government takes brutal action against anyone who protests against the genocide of the Palestinians in Gaza. In terms of refugee policy, it has completely adopted the policy of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD). And in terms of social policy, it is working with the trade unions to reduce real wages and social benefits, while the wealth of the rich is exploding.\n\nIn this climate of social and political reaction, the political heirs of Hitler now thrive. They can also present themselves as the only opposition because the Left Party -- which holds the state prime ministership in neighbouring Thuringia -- supports government policy on all key issues. And, like the Left Party split-off Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), competes with the AfD for the most reactionary anti-refugee policy.\n\nSaxony has long been notorious as a hotbed of right-wing violence under the regime of the CDU, which the SPD has served as a coalition partner for 10 years. A trail of right-wing extremist scandals runs through the police and judiciary. The fascist National Socialist Underground (NSU) trio of murderers were able to operate out of here undisturbed for years. When a right-wing extremist mob raged in Chemnitz in 2018, it was not only the head of the domestic secret service, Hans-Georg Maa\u00dfen, who lost his office as a result, but also Minister President Michael Kretschmer (CDU), who is still in office.\n\nNow, leading representatives of the SPD and the Greens express outrage at the attack on Ecke and are calling for the police to be strengthened. Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has called a special conference of state interior ministers for Tuesday to discuss \"tough action.\" SPD party leader Lars Klingbeil is urging an \"unequivocal response from the constitutional state.\"\n\nHowever, the establishment of a police state does not weaken the right-wing extremists, it strengthens them. The police are themselves permeated by right-wing extremist networks. Police officers in Saxony receive their baptism of fire when they beat up left-wing demonstrators in Leipzig. In some cases, they also work directly with right-wing extremists.\n\nSolidarity demonstrations for Matthias Ecke took place in Dresden and Berlin on Sunday. According to the organisers, around 3,000 people attended in Dresden and 1,000 in Berlin. They were mainly SPD and Green Party officials and members and people close to them.\n\nSpeakers in Dresden included SPD Chairwoman Saskia Esken, Saxony's Economics Minister Martin Dulig (SPD) and Bundestag (federal parliament) Vice-President Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckardt (Greens). CDU representatives, such as former Saxony and Federal Interior Minister Thomas de Maizi\u00e8re, also attended the rally.\n\nSpeakers in Berlin included SPD Chairman Lars Klingbeil, SPD General Secretary Kevin K\u00fchnert, Green Party Co-chairs Ricarda Lang and Omid Nouripour, Green Party politician and Fridays for Future activist Luisa Neubauer, as well as the Minister Presidents of Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia, Michael Kretschmer and Hendrik W\u00fcst (both CDU).\n\nThe speakers spouted hollow phrases about the \"unity of all democrats\" and blamed the AfD for the growing violence but uttered not a syllable about their own reactionary role. With their right-wing and dictatorial policies, they have created the basis for the far right and deliberately built up the AfD and the fascist networks in order to suppress any opposition to their pro-war policy and devastating social cuts. This will not change even after the attack on Ecke.\n\nOnly the building of an independent movement of the international working class that combines the fight against fascism with the fight against war, social inequality and for a socialist programme can stop the right-wing danger. This goal is at the centre of the European election campaign of the Sozialistische Gleichheitspartei.\n\nRead moreGrowing links between German right-wing extremists, police and state government in

Chancellor Olaf Scholz, whose Social Democrats have been a target, denounced the attacks as a threat to democracy.\n\nA spate of attacks on German officials and politicians has brought fresh worries over political violence and a breakdown of civility ahead of several critical elections this year, including in three states where the far-right Alternative for Germany party could make significant gains.\n\nIn the latest attack, on Friday evening, four people assaulted a prominent Social Democratic politician who was hanging campaign posters in Dresden, leaving him with a broken cheekbone and eye socket that required emergency surgery.\n\nThe official, Matthias Ecke, is running for re-election to the European Parliament.\n\nThat evening a Green Party campaigner, whose name has not been released, was attacked in the same residential neighborhood, by what the police believe was the same group of people. A day earlier, on Thursday, Rolf Fliss, the deputy mayor of the city of Essen, 300 miles west, was punched in the face by a group of men with whom he had been having what he initially characterized as a \"friendly exchange.\"\n\nThe violent attack on Mr. Ecke drew a sharp response from Chancellor Olaf Scholz, himself a Social Democrat, in Berlin on Saturday.\n\n\"Democracy is threatened by such things, so accepting them with a shrug is never an option,\" Mr. Scholz said. \"We are not going to take it, and we, the decent and reasonable, are the majority\" in Germany, he added.\n\nLater, on Sunday, thousands protested against the violence in Berlin and Dresden. At the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, politicians from mainstream parties and members of civil society gave speeches denouncing the assaults.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Democratic_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social Democratic Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olaf_Scholz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olaf Scholz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_for_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alternative for Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Ecke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthias Ecke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dresden"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dresden"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandenburg Gate"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Essen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Essen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/06/multimedia/06germany-attacks-jlkc/06germany-attacks-jlkc-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539335", "eventUri": "eng-9539335", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Monday", "body": "Teenager turns self in after attack on German politician\n\nA 17-year-old turned himself in to German police Sunday after an attack on a lawmaker that the country's leaders decried as a threat to democracy, as thousands turned out to march against political violence.\n\nThe teenager reported to police in the eastern city of Dresden early Sunday morning and said he was \"the perpetrator who had knocked down the SPD politician\", police said in a statement.\n\nMatthias Ecke, 41, a European parliament lawmaker for Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD), was set upon by four attackers as he put up EU election posters in Dresden on Friday night, according to police.\n\nEcke was \"seriously injured\" and required an operation after the attack, his party said.\n\nScholz on Saturday condemned the attack as a threat to democracy.\n\n\"We must never accept such acts of violence,\" he said.\n\n\"If an attack with a political motive... is confirmed just a few weeks from the European elections, this serious act of violence would also be a serious act against democracy,\" Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said.\n\nLater on Sunday Police wrote on X that the 17-year-old, who had no previous criminal record, had so far \"not commented on the motive for the offence\".\n\nArmin Schuster, interior minister for Saxony state, said police were still searching for the other attackers and he urged them to turn themselves in.\n\nIn response to the attack, the groups Zusammen gegen Rechts (Together against the Right) and Wir sind die Brandmauer Dresden (We are the Firewall Dresden) called for two anti-far-right protests to take place on Sunday, one in Berlin and another in Dresden.\n\nNew survey points to rising violence in German schools\n\nGermany's schools are grappling with an increase in violence, as revealed by the recent Schulbarometer survey involving over 1,600 teachers, which found that one in two teachers reported that they had witnessed psychological or physical violence from pupils.\n\n\"We're seeing a snapshot of a sick system,\" Dagmar Wolf, a former educator and the head of education research at the Robert Bosch Foundation, told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW).\n\nFurthermore, geopolitical tensions, such as the Israel-Hamas conflict, are also worsening the situation, as reported by DW, which also pointed out that there are significant disparities within Germany's education system, where the 3,000 top-tier schools don't face the same issues faced by schools catering to students with disadvantaged and migrant backgrounds.\n\nImmigration tops list of German voter concerns ahead of EU elections\n\nAs campaigning kicks off for the upcoming European Parliament elections slated for June, German voters are displaying an overall lack of enthusiasm, according to the latest Deutschlandtrend monthly survey by pollster Infratest-dimap.\n\nThe survey, which polled 1,280 eligible voters, indicated a big divide in voter interest, with half expressing little to no interest in the EU elections.\n\nThe survey also underscored a growing dissatisfaction with EU policies among German voters, with two-thirds expressing disappointment.\n\nThe findings showed that immigration was the central concern for 41 percent of respondents, with asylum and integration policies identified as the most pressing challenge for the EU.\n\nBeyond immigration, international conflicts (34 percent), environmental and climate protection (21 percent), and economic issues (20 percent) rounded out the list of pressing concerns for German voters.\n\nGerman far right's TikTok success sparks rush to platform\n\nSpooked by the far right's success in reaching youth voters via TikTok, Germany's political heavyweights are trying to muscle their way onto the social media platform ahead of June's European elections.\n\nChancellor Olaf Scholz, hardly famous for his sparky social media presence, made his unexpected debut on the platform in April, promising he won't be caught dancing.\n\nREAD ALSO: A fight for the youth vote: Are German politicians social media savvy enough?\n\nAnd vice-chancellor Robert Habeck followed soon afterwards, despite having previously quit Twitter and Facebook after his comments online sparked social media storms.\n\nThe timing of the German leaders' moves to join TikTok appeared to fly in the face of growing concerns in the West over the video-sharing network.\n\nLaunched in 2016 by Chinese company ByteDance, TikTok has been threatened with a ban in the United States over concerns about espionage, while the EU is investigating whether its spinoff Lite app poses a risk to young users' mental health.\n\nBut the network's reach among young people has even led US President Joe Biden to tap it for his election campaign.\n\nIn Germany, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has been by far the most successful political party on TikTok, originally known for its dance videos and challenges.\n\nUlrich Siegmund, a member of parliament for the AfD in Germany's Saxony-Anhalt state, said his party's engagement on the network has helped \"many, many people to open their eyes\".",

The 41-year-old candidate for the European Parliament elections was knocked down and seriously injured while he was putting up election campaign posters in the city of Dresden in the eastern state of Saxony on Friday evening. His fellow campaigners say he intends to continue campaigning after his recovery.\n\nFour suspects aged between 17 and 18, have been identified by the police.\n\nThe bad news, however, is that anyone involved in politics in Germany is living an increasingly dangerous life. The attack on the Social Democrat is just the tip of the iceberg: local politicians, in particular, are being massively attacked, threatened and insulted on a daily basis.\n\nLike Max Reschke, who has been the leader of the Green Party in the eastern state of Thuringia for a year.\n\n\"We have seen a pile of dung in front of the door of our party offices, eggs on the windows, smashed windows at several offices and also mailboxes blown open,\" Reschke told DW. He said he and his colleagues had been threatened with physical assault. \"Violent language has definitely increased in recent years,\" he added.\n\nGreen Party supporters, in particular, have become targets for attacks. During the campaign for the local elections at the end of May and for the European elections at the beginning of June, they have decided to never venture out alone. The Green Party campaigners have been trained to always speak calmly to people, to de-escalate and not to allow themselves to be provoked.\n\n\"There are people who used to just think things and now say them out loud. They also like to try to intimidate families. And there are others who make sure that such thoughts are turned into actions. Unfortunately, we have now seen that in Dresden,\" says Reschke.\n\nAn increase in election-related crime has been observed for a number of years. In Essen, in the most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, two Green Party politicians were recently first insulted and then physically attacked, one of them injured. In Brandenburg, angry demonstrators attacked the car of the Vice President of Germany's parliament, Katrin G\u00f6ring-Eckart (Green Party), and prevented her from continuing her journey following a campaign appearance on May 1st. In Gotha in Thuringia in February, somebody even set fire to the house of an SPD politician after he had organized a demonstration against right-wing extremism.\n\nMax Reschke is calling for local politicians to be given more police protection. \"It shouldn't be the case that something has to happen first for people to take action. And society as a whole must ask itself what direction we want to take. I don't believe that more violence and more fear make sense.\"\n\nIn a recent representative survey of more than 6,400 mayors across Germany conducted by the opinion research institute Forsa 40% of respondents stated that they or people close to them had been insulted, threatened or physically attacked. Some of them said they had thought about quitting politics as a result.\n\nHowever, this is not a purely German phenomenon, but a trend throughout Europe and also the US, according to Sven Tetzlaff, head of the Democracy and Cohesion Department at the K\u00f6rber Foundation.\n\nTetzlaff told DW that social media play a part in changing public discourse. \"People are egging each other on to express their hatred of the state, of the system, of politics, of 'those at the top'. And we also know that the inhibition thresholds for physically attacking people drop significantly if language continues to develop in this direction,\" Tetzlaff explained.\n\nThe willingness to find a compromise or a balance of interests is declining, according to Tetzlaff. \"And that means that people then say, if my interests are ignored, then I reject the system, then I insult the politician who does not act on my interests,\" he said.\n\n\"Stark im Amt\" (strong in office) is an online portal for local politicians which was launched in 2021 by the K\u00f6rber Foundation and initiated together with the German Association of Cities, the German Association of Counties and the German Association of Towns and Municipalities. Around 3,000 local politicians click on the site every month to find out about strategies for prevention and combating threats and online hate speech.\n\nIf local politicians withdraw after the attack on Matthias Ecke out of fear for their safety, Sven Tetzlaff fears a threatening scenario: \"If people at the first level of democracy, in the 11,000 plus municipalities in Germany, no longer get involved,\" he says, then people will get the impression that democracy no longer functions. \"And if we no longer have confidence locally that this democratic state will continue to function, we really do have a massive problem in Germany,\" Tetzlaff concluded.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"},

{"id": 223668452, "title": "MH370: Missing plane 'buried in ocean trench by pilot' claims Boeing expert", "text": "Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 could have been \"buried in an ocean trench\" by the pilot, a Boeing expert has claimed 10 years after the disappearance of the aircraft. Simon Hardy, a British Boeing 777 pilot, believes the flight's take-off documents are clues that the pilot had planned a mass murder-suicide. He claims that clues including last-minute changes to the cargo such as 3,000kg of fuel and extra oxygen, might indicate that Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shad might have directed the plane \"to oblivion\". The plane, with 239 passengers on board, disappeared from flight radar over the South China Sea and has never been found, despite extensive search. This is one of the biggest aviation mysteries and over the years there have been a number of theories, including fears that the pilot crashed the plane on purpose. Mr Hardy, who was invited to join the search with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) in 2015, calculated the most likely position of the remains of the doomed flight. But since his calculations put the remains of the plane just outside the official search area, he never had a chance to prove his theory. According to the Boeing pilot, the doomed plane could have plunged into the ocean in an area known as the Geelvinck Fracture Zone. The trench is hundreds of miles long, meaning the pilot would have had room for manoeuvre when deciding the moment he would ditch the plane, Mr Hardy told The Sun. Since the area is also plagued by earthquakes, there is a possibility the vanished jet could be buried beneath rocks in the ocean, in an area that has never been searched, the pilot added. According to Mr Hardy's theory, the pilot deliberately depressurised the cabin to make passengers unconscious before making a U-turn and crashing the plane. His theory was echoed by formal naval officer Peter Waring, 41, who was also involved in the so-far unsuccessful search for the aircraft. Like Mr Hardy, Mr Waring, who is an expert in mapping sea floors, also believes MH370 was deliberately crashed into the Geelvinck Fracture Zone, nearly a thousand miles away from the 7th Arc. He said: \"'I think [the search team] may have gone wrong with the assumption that the aircraft wasn't under control at the end We were taking this quite seriously during the search, that the aircraft may have continued to be under control in one form or another after it crossed the 7th Arc. Once that had happened that means that the aircraft was probably further south.\" He added: \"There was a whole lot wasted effort looking in the wrong areas.\" This year, a marine robotics company submitted a proposal to the Malaysian government to continue the search for the passenger flight. The Association for Families of the Passengers and Crew on board MH370 announced the proposal on their Facebook page \"MH370 Families,\" saying that the operation, if approved, would commence on a 'No Find - No Fee' basis by Ocean Infinity, a marine robotics company based in Texas, US. A post read: \"Ocean Infinity made a successful presentation on a new search proposal for MH370 on a No Find No Fee basis to the Minister of Transport Malaysia, Senior Ministry Officials as well as other Government Agencies.\" The group added that the presentation was \"well received by the Minister and his team\" and said: \"We wait for the required paperwork to be sorted out and a new contract is inked. MH370 families would like to extend our appreciation to all concerned.\" Transport Minister Anthony Loke had previously said the government intends to fund and restart the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. Speaking at the 10th Remembrance Event for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, Loke stated that the cabinet could review Ocean Infinity's proposal for a \"no cure, no fee\" search within weeks. The minister indicated that once Ocean Infinity finalised its proposal, the government would contact the Australian government.", "summary": "British Boeing 777 pilot Simon Hardy believes the remains of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 could be buried in an ocean trench known as the Geelvinck Fracture Zone", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/mh370-missing-plane-buried-ocean-32895764", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32895948.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Search-for-missing-Malaysia-Airlines-flight-MH370-continues.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:02:39", "author": "Chiara Fiorillo,Chiara-fiorillo", "authors": ["Chiara Fiorillo", "Chiara-fiorillo"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.541}

Environment Programme estimate.\n\nBetter heat-health warning systems in 57 countries could save 98,314 lives per year, the report said, based on World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization estimates.\n\n\"Crippling heat is everywhere, but it doesn't affect everyone equally,\" Guterres said. \"Extreme heat amplifies inequality, inflames food insecurity and pushes people further into poverty.\"\n\nMore than 1,300 people died during this year's annual Haj pilgrimage after walking in scorching heat.\n\nEarlier this year, India's prolonged heatwaves resulted in the deaths of at least 100 people. However, health experts say heat deaths are likely undercounted in India and potentially other countries.\n\nLast year, the United States had its most recorded heat deaths in more than 80 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The death certificates of more than 2,300 people mentioned excessive heat, including 874 deaths in Arizona.\n\nDeadly heat is not new, but scientists say it has been amplified in scale, frequency and duration with climate change.\n\nExtreme heat, wildfires, floods, droughts and ever more fierce hurricanes are symptoms and \"we need to fight the disease,\" Guterres said. \"The disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction.\"\n\n\"Many things are being done, but too little, too late,\" he said. \"The problem is that climate change is running faster than all the measures that are now being put in place to fight it.\"\n\nBefore July 3, 2023, the hottest day measured by Copernicus was 16.8 degrees Celsius (62.2 degrees Fahrenheit) on August 13, 2016. In the last 13 months that mark has now been beaten 59 times, according to Copernicus.\n\nHumanity is now \"operating in a world that is already much warmer than it was before,\" Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said.\n\n\"The steady drumbeat of hottest-day-ever records and near-records is concerning for three main reasons. The first is that heat is a killer. The second is that the health impacts of heat waves become much more serious when events persist. The third is that the hottest-day records this year are a surprise,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field.\n\nField said high temperatures usually occur during El Nino years -- a natural warming of the equatorial Pacific that changes weather worldwide -- but the last El Nino ended in April.\n\nField said these high temperatures \"underscores the seriousness of the climate crisis.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately people are going to die and those deaths are preventable,\" said Kristie Ebi, a public health and climate professor at the University of Washington. \"Heat is called the silent killer for a reason. People often don't know they're in trouble with heat until it's too late.\"\n\n\"At some point, the accumulated heat internally becomes too much, then your cells and your organs start to warm up,\" Ebi said.\n\nThe \"big driver\" of the current heat is greenhouse gas emissions, from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Buontempo said. Those gases help trap heat, changing the energy balance between the heat coming in from the sun and that escaping Earth, meaning the planet retains more heat energy than before, he said.\n\nOther factors include the warming of the Pacific by El Nino; the sun reaching its peak cycle of activity; an undersea volcano explosion; and air with fewer heat-reflecting particles because of marine fuel pollution regulations, experts said.\n\nThe last 13 months have all set heat records. The world's oceans broke heat records for 15 months in a row and that water heat, along with an unusually warm Antarctica, are helping push temperatures to record level, Buontempo said.", "source":

Environment Programme estimate.\n\nBetter heat-health warning systems in 57 countries could save 98,314 lives per year, the report said, based on World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization estimates.\n\n\"Crippling heat is everywhere, but it doesn't affect everyone equally,\" Guterres said. \"Extreme heat amplifies inequality, inflames food insecurity and pushes people further into poverty.\"\n\nMore than 1,300 people died during this year's annual Haj pilgrimage after walking in scorching heat.\n\nEarlier this year, India's prolonged heatwaves resulted in the deaths of at least 100 people. However, health experts say heat deaths are likely undercounted in India and potentially other countries.\n\nLast year, the United States had its most recorded heat deaths in more than 80 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The death certificates of more than 2,300 people mentioned excessive heat, including 874 deaths in Arizona.\n\nDeadly heat is not new, but scientists say it has been amplified in scale, frequency and duration with climate change.\n\nExtreme heat, wildfires, floods, droughts and ever more fierce hurricanes are symptoms and \"we need to fight the disease,\" Guterres said. \"The disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction.\"\n\n\"Many things are being done, but too little, too late,\" he said. \"The problem is that climate change is running faster than all the measures that are now being put in place to fight it.\"\n\nBefore July 3, 2023, the hottest day measured by Copernicus was 62.2 degrees Fahrenheit on August 13, 2016. In the last 13 months that mark has now been beaten 59 times, according to Copernicus.\n\nHumanity is now \"operating in a world that is already much warmer than it was before,\" Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said.\n\n\"The steady drumbeat of hottest-day-ever records and near-records is concerning for three main reasons. The first is that heat is a killer. The second is that the health impacts of heat waves become much more serious when events persist. The third is that the hottest-day records this year are a surprise,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field.\n\nField said high temperatures usually occur during El Nino years -- a natural warming of the equatorial Pacific that changes weather worldwide -- but the last El Nino ended in April.\n\nField said these high temperatures \"underscores the seriousness of the climate crisis.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately people are going to die and those deaths are preventable,\" said Kristie Ebi, a public health and climate professor at the University of Washington. \"Heat is called the silent killer for a reason. People often don't know they're in trouble with heat until it's too late.\"\n\n\"At some point, the accumulated heat internally becomes too much, then your cells and your organs start to warm up,\" Ebi said.\n\nThe \"big driver\" of the current heat is greenhouse gas emissions, from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Buontempo said. Those gases help trap heat, changing the energy balance between the heat coming in from the sun and that escaping Earth, meaning the planet retains more heat energy than before, he said.\n\nOther factors include the warming of the Pacific by El Nino; the sun reaching its peak cycle of activity; an undersea volcano explosion; and air with fewer heat-reflecting particles because of marine fuel pollution regulations, experts said.\n\nThe last 13 months have all set heat records. The world's oceans broke heat records for 15 months in a row and that water heat, along with an unusually warm Antarctica, are helping push temperatures to record level, Buontempo said.\n\n___\n\nBorenstein reported from Washington, D.C., Arasu from Bengaluru, India.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nNearly half a million people a year die worldwide from heat related deaths, far more than other weather extremes such as hurricanes, and this is likely an underestimate, a new report by 10 U.N. agencies said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Billions of people are facing an extreme heat epidemic -- wilting under increasingly deadly heat waves, with temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius around the world,\" Guterres said. \"That's 122 degrees Fahrenheit and halfway to boiling.\"\n\nThe dire warnings came after a barely noticeable respite in back-to-back record global heat.\n\nThe European climate service Copernicus calculated that Tuesday's global average temperature was 0.01 Celsius (0.01 Fahrenheit) lower than Monday's all-time high of 17.16 degrees Celsius (62.8 degrees Fahrenheit), which was .06 degrees Celsius hotter (0.1 degrees Fahrenheit) than Sunday.\n\nAll three days were hotter than Earth's previous hottest day in 2023.\n\n\"We are not prepared,\" the U.N. report said.\n\nGuterres urged countries of the world to adopt several proposals aimed at reducing heat deaths, starting with help to cool and care for the most vulnerable people -- the poor, elderly, young and sick.\n\nThe U.N. also called for better heat wave warnings, expanding \"passive cooling,\" improved urban design, stronger protections for outside workers, as well as greater efforts to tackle human-caused climate change that's worsening weather extremes.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut officials said most work will have to be done by countries, with the U.N. offering aid and coordination, especially when it comes to beefing up weather warning systems.\n\nIf countries adopt the United Nations heat-fighting recommendations, \"these measures could protect 3.5 billion people by 2050, while slashing emissions and saving consumers $1 trillion a year,\" Guterres said, citing a U.N. Environment Programme estimate.\n\nBetter heat-health warning systems in 57 countries could save 98,314 lives per year, the report said, based on World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization estimates.\n\n\"Crippling heat is everywhere, but it doesn't affect everyone equally,\" Guterres said. \"Extreme heat amplifies inequality, inflames food insecurity and pushes people further into poverty.\"\n\nMore than 1,300 people died during this year's annual Haj pilgrimage after walking in scorching heat.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nEarlier this year, India's prolonged heatwaves resulted in the deaths of at least 100 people. However, health experts say heat deaths are likely undercounted in India and potentially other countries.\n\nLast year, the United States had its most recorded heat deaths in more than 80 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The death certificates of more than 2,300 people mentioned excessive heat, including 874 deaths in Arizona.\n\nDeadly heat is not new, but scientists say it has been amplified in scale, frequency and duration with climate change.\n\nExtreme heat, wildfires, floods, droughts and ever more fierce hurricanes are symptoms and \"we need to fight the disease,\" Guterres said. \"The disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction.\"\n\n\"Many things are being done, but too little, too late,\" he said. \"The problem is that climate change is running faster than all the measures that are now being put in place to fight it.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBefore July 3, 2023, the hottest day measured by Copernicus was 16.8 degrees Celsius (62.2 degrees Fahrenheit) on August 13, 2016. In the last 13 months that mark has now been beaten 59 times, according to Copernicus.\n\nHumanity is now \"operating in a world that is already much warmer than it was before,\" Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said.\n\n\"The steady drumbeat of hottest-day-ever records and near-records is concerning for three main reasons. The first is that heat is a killer. The second is that the health impacts of heat waves become much more serious when events persist. The third is that the hottest-day records this year are a surprise,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field.\n\nField said high temperatures usually occur during El Nino years -- a natural warming of the equatorial Pacific that changes weather worldwide -- but the last El Nino ended in April.\n\nField said these high temperatures \"underscores the seriousness of the climate crisis.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately people are going to die and those deaths are preventable,\" said Kristie Ebi, a public health and climate professor at the University of Washington. \"Heat is called the silent killer for a reason. People often don't know they're in trouble with heat until it's too late.\"\n\n\"At some point, the accumulated heat internally becomes too much, then your cells and your organs start to warm up,\" Ebi said.\n\nThe \"big driver\" of the current heat is greenhouse gas emissions, from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Buontempo said. Those gases help trap heat, changing the energy balance between the heat coming in from the sun and that escaping Earth, meaning the planet retains more heat energy than before, he said.\n\nOther factors include the warming of the Pacific by El Nino; the sun reaching its peak cycle of activity; an undersea volcano explosion; and air with fewer heat-reflecting particles because of marine fuel pollution regulations, experts said.\n\nThe last 13 months have all set heat records. The world's oceans broke heat records for 15 months in a row and that water heat, along with an unusually warm Antarctica, are helping push temperatures to record level, Buontempo said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nBorenstein reported from Washington, D.C., Arasu from Bengaluru, India.\n\n___\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein at @borenbears and Sibi Arasu on X at @sibi123\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

But the living is no longer easy.\n\nThis has been a week of unprecedented heat. First, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service declared Sunday, 21 July, as the hottest day on record. Then on Monday, 22 July, the mercury climbed even higher. And now we have just received preliminary data indicating that Tuesday, 23 July, was in the same range. In other words, this past Sunday, Monday and Tuesday were the three hottest days on record.\n\nBut, let's face facts: extreme temperatures are no longer a one day, one week or one month phenomenon. If there is one thing that unites our divided world, it's that we're all increasingly feeling the heat. Earth is becoming hotter and more dangerous for everyone, everywhere.\n\nBillions of people are facing an extreme heat epidemic -- wilting under increasingly deadly heatwaves, with temperatures topping 50\u00b0C around the world. That's 122\u00b0F. And halfway to boiling.\n\nThis year, we've seen a deadly heatwave hit the Sahel -- with spiking hospitalizations and deaths. And broken temperature records across the United States -- reportedly placing 120 million people under heat advisory warnings. Scorching conditions have killed 1,300 pilgrims during Haj; shut down tourist attractions in Europe's sweatbox cities; and closed schools across Asia and Africa, impacting more than 80 million children.\n\nOf course, summer heat is as old as the hills. But, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and others have documented a rapid rise in the scale, intensity, frequency and duration of extreme-heat events. And it comes against a background of ever-rising temperatures -- with June officially the thirteenth consecutive month to break global temperature records.\n\nExtreme heat is increasingly tearing through economies, widening inequalities, undermining the Sustainable Development Goals and killing people. Heat is estimated to kill almost half a million people a year, that's about 30 times more than tropical cyclones.\n\nWe know what is driving it: fossil fuel-charged, human-induced climate change. And we know it's going to get worse. Extreme heat is the new abnormal. But, the good news is that there are solutions. The good news is we can save lives and limit its impact. Today, we are launching a global call to action with four areas of focus.\n\nFirst, caring for the most vulnerable. Crippling heat is everywhere -- but it doesn't affect everyone equally. Those most at risk when the mercury soars include the urban poor, pregnant women, people with disabilities, older people, the very young, the sick, the displaced and the impoverished - who often live in substandard housing without access to cooling. For example, heat-related deaths for people over 65 years of age increased around 85 per cent in 20 years.\n\nThe United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) tells us that almost 25 per cent of all children today are exposed to frequent heatwaves. By 2050, that could rise to virtually 100 per cent. And the number of urban poor living in extreme heat could rise 700 per cent. Extreme heat amplifies inequality, inflames food insecurity and pushes people further into poverty.\n\nWe must respond by massively increasing access to low-carbon cooling; expanding passive cooling -- such as natural solutions and urban design; and cleaning up cooling technologies while boosting their efficiency. The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that, together, these measures could protect 3.5 billion people by 2050, while slashing emissions and saving consumers $1 trillion a year.\n\nIt's also vital to boost protection for the most vulnerable -- in line with the Early Warning Systems for All initiative. The World Health Organization (WHO), and the World Meteorological Organization estimate that scaling up heat health-warning systems in 57 countries alone could save almost 100,000 lives a year.\n\nFinance to help safeguard communities from climate chaos is essential. And I urge developed countries to honour their promises, and show how they will close the gaping adaptation finance gap.\n\nSecond, we must step up protections for workers. A new report from the International Labour Organization (ILO) -- being released today -- warns that over 70 per cent of the global workforce -- 2.4 billion people -- are now at high risk of extreme heat.\n\nIn Asia and the Pacific, three in four workers are now exposed to extreme heat. More than 8 out of 10 in Arab States, more than 9 out of 10 in Africa. Meanwhile, the Europe and Central Asia region has the most rapidly increasing workforce exposure to excessive heat. And the Americas is seeing the most rapidly increasing heat-related occupational injuries. All of this is having a profound impact on people and the economy.\n\nExcessive heat is the cause of almost 23 million workplace injuries worldwide. And as daily temperatures rise above 34\u00b0C -- or 93.2\u00b0F -- labour productivity drops by 50 per cent. Heat stress at work is projected to cost the global economy $2.4 trillion by 2030. Up from $280 billion in the mid-1990s. We need measures to protect workers, grounded in human rights. And we must ensure that laws and regulations reflect the reality of extreme heat today -- and are enforced.\n\nThird, we must massively boost the resilience of economies and societies using data and science. Extreme heat impacts almost every area: Infrastructure buckles, crops fail and pressure piles on water supplies, health systems and electricity grids. Cities are a particular worry -- they are heating up at twice the global average. Countries, cities and sectors need comprehensive, tailored Heat Action Plans, based on the best science and data. And we need a concerted effort to heat-proof economies, critical sectors and the built environment.\n\nFinally, I want to make one overarching point. Today, our focus is on the impact of extreme heat. But, let's not forget that there are many other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: ever-more fierce hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires, rising sea levels. The list goes on.\n\nTo tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease. The disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction. Leaders across the board must wake up and step up.\n\nThat means Governments -- especially Group of 20 (G20) countries -- as well as the private sector, cities and regions acting as though our future depends on it -- because it does. All countries must deliver by next year nationally determined contributions -- or national climate action plans -- aligned to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nThe International Energy Agency has shown that fossil fuel expansion and new coal plants are inconsistent with meeting that limit. I must call out the flood of fossil fuel expansion we are seeing in some of the world's wealthiest countries. In signing such a surge of new oil and gas licenses, they are signing away our future.\n\nThe leadership of those with the greatest capabilities and capacities is essential. Countries must phase-out fossil fuels -- fast and fairly. They must end new coal projects. The G20 must shift fossil fuel subsidies to renewables and support vulnerable countries and communities.\n\nAnd national climate action plans must show how each country will contribute to the global goals agreed at COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] to triple the world's renewables capacity, and end deforestation by 2030. They must also cut global consumption and production of fossil fuels by 30 per cent in the same timeframe.\n\nAnd we need similar 1.5\u00b0C-aligned transition plans from business, the financial sector, cities and regions -- following the recommendations of my High-Level Expert Group on Net Zero.\n\nClimate action also requires finance action. That includes countries coming together for a strong finance outcome from COP29; progress on innovative sources of finance; drastically boosting the lending capacity of multilateral development banks to help developing countries tackle the climate crisis; and wealthier countries making good on all their climate finance commitments.\n\nThe message is clear: the heat is on. Extreme heat is having an extreme impact on people and planet. The world must rise to the challenge of rising temperatures.", "source": {"uri": "press.un.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "press.un.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The first is that heat is a killer. The second is that the health impacts of heat waves become much more serious when events persist. The third is that the hottest-day records this year are a surprise,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field.\n\nField said high temperatures usually occur during El Nino years -- a natural warming of the equatorial Pacific that triggers weather extremes across the globe -- but the last El Nino ended in April.\n\nField said these high temperatures \"underscores the seriousness of the climate crisis.\"\n\n\"This has been, I mean, probably the shortest-lived record ever,\" Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said Wednesday, after his agency calculated that Monday had beaten Sunday's mark. And he predicted that mark would also quickly fall. \"We are in uncharted territory.\"\n\nBefore July 3, 2023, the hottest day measured by Copernicus was 16.8 degrees Celsius (62.2 degrees Fahrenheit) on August 13, 2016. In the last 13 months that mark has now been beaten 59 times, according to Copernicus.\n\nHumanity is now \"operating in a world that is already much warmer than it was before,\" Buontempo said.\n\n\"Unfortunately people are going to die and those deaths are preventable,\" said Kristie Ebi, a public health and climate professor at the University of Washington. \"Heat is called the silent killer for a reason. People often don't know they're in trouble with heat until it's too late.\"\n\nIn past heat waves, including in 2021 in the Pacific Northwest, heat deaths didn't start piling up until day two, Ebi said.\n\n\"At some point, the accumulated heat internally becomes too much, then your cells and your organs start to warm up,\" Ebi said.\n\nLast year, the United States had its most recorded heat deaths in more than 80 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The death certificates of more than 2,300 people mentioned excessive heat. Heat killed 874 people in Arizona, 450 in Texas, 226 in Nevada, 84 in Florida and 83 in Louisiana.\n\nEarlier this year, India witnessed prolonged heatwaves that resulted in the death of at least 100 people. However, health experts say heat deaths are likely undercounted in India and potentially other countries.\n\nThe \"big driver\" of the current heat is greenhouse gas emissions, from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Buontempo said. Those gases help trap heat, changing the energy balance between the heat coming in from the sun and that escaping Earth, meaning the planet retains more heat energy than before, he said.\n\nOther factors include the warming of the Pacific by El Nino; the sun reaching its peak cycle of activity; an undersea volcano explosion; and air with fewer heat-reflecting particles because of marine fuel pollution regulations, experts said.\n\nThe last 13 months have all set heat records. The world's oceans broke heat records for 15 months in a row and that water heat, along with an unusually warm Antarctica, are helping push temperatures to record level, Buontempo said.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised to see Thursday, Friday and Saturday also set new warmest day records,\" said climate scientist Andrew Weaver at the University of Victoria in Canada, which has been broiling in the warmth.", "source": {"uri": "cenlanow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WNTZ - cenlanow.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@cenlanow.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

The third is that the hottest-day records this year are a surprise,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field.\n\nField said high temperatures usually occur during El Nino years -- a natural warming of the equatorial Pacific that triggers weather extremes across the globe -- but the last El Nino ended in April.\n\nField said these high temperatures \"underscores the seriousness of the climate crisis.\"\n\n\"This has been, I mean, probably the shortest-lived record ever,\" Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said Wednesday, after his agency calculated that Monday had beaten Sunday's mark.

The death certificates of more than 2,300 people mentioned excessive heat. Heat killed 874 people in Arizona, 450 in Texas, 226 in Nevada, 84 in Florida and 83 in Louisiana.\n\nEarlier this year, India witnessed prolonged heatwaves that resulted in the death of at least a 100 people. However, health experts say heat deaths are likely undercounted in India and potentially other countries.\n\nThe \"big driver\" of the current heat is greenhouse gas emissions, from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Buontempo said. Those gases help trap heat, changing the energy balance between the heat coming in from the sun and that escaping Earth, meaning the planet retains more heat energy than before, he said.\n\nOther factors include the warming of the Pacific by El Nino; the sun reaching its peak cycle of activity; an undersea volcano explosion; and air with fewer heat-reflecting particles because of marine fuel pollution regulations, experts said.\n\nThe last 13 months have all set heat records. The world's oceans broke heat records for 15 months in a row and that water heat, along with an unusually warm Antarctica, are helping push temperatures to record level, Buontempo said.\n\n\"I

And halfway to boiling.\"\n\nAccording to the European Copernicus network, July 21, 22 and 23 were the three hottest days ever recorded worldwide, with July 22 holding the absolute record of 17.16 degrees Celsius (62.9 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nGuterres repeated his call for humanity to fight its \"addiction\" to fossil fuels.\n\n\"Today, our focus is on the impact of extreme heat. But let's not forget that there are many other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: ever-more fierce hurricanes. Floods. Droughts. Wildfires. Rising sea levels. And the list goes on,\" he said.\n\n\"To tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease. And the disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction,\" he stressed, calling in particular on G20 countries to take action.\n\nWhile 2023 was the hottest year on record, and 2024 could set a new record, temperatures well above 40C (104F) are increasingly common.\n\nIn the space of a year, the 50C threshold has even been exceeded in at least 10 places, from Death Valley in the United States (53.9C on July 7) to Agadir in Morocco, and also in China and India.\n\nThe intense heat, often less visible than other devastating impacts of climate change such as storms or floods, is nonetheless more deadly.\n\nThis \"silent killer\" is responsible for around 489,000 deaths per year between 2000 and 2019, compared with 16,000 deaths per year from cyclones, according to the UN's \"Call to Action\" document published on Thursday.\n\nExtremely high temperatures also have an economic impact, with the UN estimating economic losses from heat stress at work will reach $2.4 trillion in 2030.\n\nAccording to a report by the International Labor Organization published on Thursday, more than 70 percent of workers were exposed to excessive heat in 2020, 8.8 percent more than in 2000.\n\n\"The good news is that we can save lives and we can limit its impact,\" Guterres said Thursday.\n\nThe UN has called for the world community to first act to protect \"the most vulnerable\" -- including young children, the elderly and also humanity's poorest.\n\nIn this context, early warning systems should include extreme heat, warning populations of the arrival of heat waves and informing them of the precautions to take, the document says.\n\nThe call to action also recommends an \"increase (to) equitable access to and scale up (of) low-carbon cooling.\"\n\nThis would involve investing in passive cooling systems -- which include climate-sensitive urban design measures, reflective surfaces and natural cooling systems -- and the phase-out of climate-warming gases that are used in many cooling systems.", "source":

A heat wave warning was issued in Seoul as temperatures soared 33 degrees Celsius (91.4 degrees Fahrenheit). (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)\n\nGlobal temperatures dropped a minuscule amount after two days of record highs, making Tuesday only the world's second-hottest day ever.\n\nThe European climate service Copernicus calculated that Tuesday's global average temperature was 0.01 Celsius (0.01 Fahrenheit) lower than Monday's all-time high of 17.16 degrees Celsius (62.8 degrees Fahrenheit), which was .06 degrees Celsius hotter (0.1 degrees Fahrenheit) than Sunday.\n\nAll three days were hotter than Earth's previous hottest day in 2023.\n\n\"The steady drumbeat of hottest-day-ever records and near-records is concerning for three main reasons. The first is that heat is a killer. The second is that the health impacts of heat waves become much more serious when events persist. The third is that the hottest-day records this year are a surprise,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field.\n\nField said high temperatures usually occur during El Nino years -- a natural warming of the equatorial Pacific that triggers weather extremes across the globe -- but the last El Nino ended in April.\n\nField said these high temperatures \"underscores the seriousness of the climate crisis.\"\n\n\"This has been, I mean, probably the shortest-lived record ever,\" Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said Wednesday, after his agency calculated that Monday had beaten Sunday's mark. And he predicted that mark would also quickly fall. \"We are in uncharted territory.\"\n\nBefore July 3, 2023, the hottest day measured by Copernicus was 16.8 degrees Celsius (62.2 degrees Fahrenheit) on August 13, 2016. In the last 13 months that mark has now been beaten 59 times, according to Copernicus.\n\nHumanity is now \"operating in a world that is already much warmer than it was before,\" Buontempo said.\n\n\"Unfortunately people are going to die and those deaths are preventable,\" said Kristie Ebi, a public health and climate professor at the University of Washington. \"Heat is called the silent killer for a reason. People often don't know they're in trouble with heat until it's too late.\"\n\nIn past heat waves, including in 2021 in the Pacific Northwest, heat deaths didn't start piling up until day two, Ebi said.\n\n\"At some point, the accumulated heat internally becomes too much, then your cells and your organs start to warm up,\" Ebi said.\n\nLast year, the United States had its most recorded heat deaths in more than 80 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The death certificates of more than 2,300 people mentioned excessive heat. Heat killed 874 people in Arizona, 450 in Texas, 226 in Nevada, 84 in Florida and 83 in Louisiana.\n\nEarlier this year, India witnessed prolonged heatwaves that resulted in the death of at least a 100 people. However, health experts say heat deaths are likely undercounted in India and potentially other countries.\n\nThe \"big driver\" of the current heat is greenhouse gas emissions, from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Buontempo said. Those gases help trap heat, changing the energy balance between the heat coming in from the sun and that escaping Earth, meaning the planet retains more heat energy than before, he said.\n\nOther factors include the warming of the Pacific by El Nino; the sun reaching its peak cycle of activity; an undersea volcano explosion; and air with fewer heat-reflecting particles because of marine fuel pollution regulations, experts said.\n\nThe last 13 months have all set heat records. The world's oceans broke heat records for 15 months in a row and that water heat, along with an unusually warm Antarctica, are helping push temperatures to record level, Buontempo said.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised to see Thursday, Friday and Saturday also set new warmest day records,\" said climate scientist Andrew Weaver at the University of Victoria in Canada, which has been broiling in the warmth.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

First, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service declared Sunday July 21st as the hottest day on record. Then on Monday July 22nd, the mercury climbed even higher.\n\nAnd now we have just received preliminary data indicating that Tuesday July 23rd was in the same range.\n\nIn other words, this past Sunday, Monday and Tuesday were the three hottest days on record.\n\nBut let's face facts: extreme temperatures are no longer a one day, one week or one month phenomenon.\n\nIf there is one thing that unites our divided world, it's that we're all increasingly feeling the heat.\n\nEarth is becoming hotter and more dangerous for everyone, everywhere.\n\nBillions of people are facing an extreme heat epidemic -- wilting under increasingly deadly heatwaves, with temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius around the world. That's 122 degrees Fahrenheit. And halfway to boiling.\n\nThis year, we've seen a deadly heatwave hit the Sahel - with spiking hospitalisations and deaths.\n\nAnd broken temperature records across the United States - reportedly placing 120 million people under heat advisory warnings.\n\nScorching conditions have killed 1,300 pilgrims during Haj;\n\nShut down tourist attractions in Europe's sweatbox cities;\n\nAnd closed schools across Asia and Africa - impacting more than 80 million children.\n\nOf course, summer heat is as old as the hills.\n\nBut the World Meteorological Organization, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and others have documented a rapid rise in the scale, intensity, frequency and duration of extreme-heat events.\n\nAnd it comes against a background of ever-rising temperatures - with June officially the 13th consecutive month to break global temperature records.\n\nExtreme heat is increasingly tearing through economies, widening inequalities, undermining the Sustainable Development Goals and killing people.\n\nHeat is estimated to kill almost half a million people a year, that's about 30 times more than tropical cyclones.\n\nWe know what is driving it: fossil fuel-charged, human-induced climate change.\n\nThe good news is we can save lives and limit its impact.\n\nToday, we are launching a global call to action with four areas of focus.\n\nFirst, caring for the most vulnerable.\n\nCrippling heat is everywhere - but it doesn't affect everyone equally.\n\nThose most at risk when the mercury soars include the urban poor. Pregnant women. People with disabilities. Older people. The very young, the sick, the displaced, and the impoverished - who often live in substandard housing without access to cooling.\n\nFor example, heat-related deaths for people over 65 years of age increased around 85 percent in 20 years.\n\nUNICEF tells us that almost 25 per cent of all children today are exposed to frequent heatwaves. By 2050, that could rise to virtually 100 per cent.\n\nAnd the number of urban poor living in extreme heat could rise 700 per cent.\n\nExtreme heat amplifies inequality, inflames food insecurity, and pushes people further into poverty.\n\nWe must respond by massively increasing access to low-carbon cooling; expanding passive cooling - such as natural solutions and urban design; and cleaning up cooling technologies while boosting their efficiency.\n\nThe United Nations Environment Programme estimates that, together, these measures could protect 3.5 billion people by 2050, while slashing emissions and saving consumers $1 trillion a year.\n\nIt's also vital to boost protection for the most vulnerable - in line with the Early Warning Systems for All initiative.\n\nThe World Health Organization, and the World Meteorological Organization estimate that scaling-up heat health-warning systems in 57 countries alone could save almost 100,000 lives a year.\n\nFinance to help safeguard communities from climate chaos is essential. And I urge developed countries to honour their promises, and show how they will close the gaping adaptation finance gap.\n\nSecond, we must step up protections for workers.\n\nA new report from the International Labour Organization - being released today - warns that over 70 per cent of the global workforce - 2.4 billion people - are now at high risk of extreme heat.\n\nIn Asia and the Pacific, three in four workers are now exposed to extreme heat. More than eight out of ten in Arab States, more than nine out of ten in Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, the Europe and Central Asia region has the most rapidly increasing workforce exposure to excessive heat.\n\nAnd the Americas is seeing the most rapidly increasing heat-related occupational injuries.\n\nAll of this is having a profound impact on people and the economy.\n\nExcessive heat is the cause of almost 23 million workplace injuries worldwide.\n\nAnd as daily temperatures rise above 34\u00b0C - or 93.2\u00b0F - labour productivity drops by 50%.\n\nHeat stress at work is projected to cost the global economy $2.4 trillion by 2030. Up from $280 billion in the mid-1990s.\n\nWe need measures to protect workers, grounded in human rights.\n\nAnd we must ensure that laws and regulations reflect the reality of extreme heat today - and are enforced.\n\nThird, we must massively boost the resilience of economies and societies using data and science.\n\nExtreme heat impacts almost every area:\n\nInfrastructure buckles, crops fail, and pressure piles on water supplies, health systems and electricity grids.\n\nCities are a particular worry - they are heating up at twice the global average.\n\nCountries, cities, and sectors need comprehensive, tailored Heat Action Plans, based on the best science and data.\n\nAnd we need a concerted effort to heatproof economies, critical sectors, and the built environment.\n\nFinally, I want to make one over-arching point.\n\nToday, our focus is on the impact of extreme heat. But let's not forget that there are many other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: Ever-more fierce hurricanes. Floods. Droughts. Wildfires. Rising sea levels. The list goes on.\n\nTo tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease.\n\nThe disease is the madness of incinerating our only home.\n\nThat means governments - especially G20 countries - as well as the private sector, cities and regions acting as though our future depends on it - because it does.\n\nAll countries must deliver by next year nationally determined contributions - or national climate action plans - aligned to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe International Energy Agency has shown that fossil fuel expansion and new coal plants are inconsistent with meeting that limit.\n\nI must call out the flood of fossil fuel expansion we are seeing in some of the world's wealthiest countries. In signing such a surge of new oil and gas licenses, they are signing away our future.\n\nThe leadership of those with the greatest capabilities and capacities is essential.\n\nCountries must phase-out fossil fuels - fast and fairly.\n\nThey must end new coal projects.\n\nThe G20 must shift fossil fuel subsidies to renewables and support vulnerable countries and communities.\n\nAnd national climate action plans must show how each country will contribute to the global goals agreed at COP28 to triple the world's renewables capacity, and end deforestation - by 2030.\n\nThey must also cut global consumption and production of fossil fuels by thirty percent in the same timeframe.\n\nAnd we need similar 1.5-aligned transition plans from business, the financial sector, cities and regions - following the recommendations of my High-Level Expert Group on Net Zero.\n\nClimate action also requires finance action.\n\nThat includes countries coming together for a strong finance outcome from COP29; progress on innovative sources of finance; drastically boosting the lending capacity of multilateral development banks to help developing countries tackle the climate crisis; and wealthier countries making good on all their climate finance commitments.\n\nThe message is clear: the heat is on.\n\nExtreme heat is having an extreme impact on people and planet.\n\nThe world must rise to the challenge of rising temperatures.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The death certificates of more than 2,300 people mentioned excessive heat. Heat killed 874 people in Arizona, 450 in Texas, 226 in Nevada, 84 in Florida and 83 in Louisiana.\n\nEarlier this year, India witnessed prolonged heatwaves that resulted in the death of at least a 100 people.

Those gases help trap heat, changing the energy balance between the heat coming in from the sun and that escaping Earth, meaning the planet retains more heat energy than before, he said.\n\nOther factors include the warming of the Pacific by El Nino; the sun reaching its peak cycle of activity; an undersea volcano explosion; and air with fewer heat-reflecting particles because of marine fuel pollution regulations, experts said.\n\nThe last 13 months have all set heat records. The world's oceans broke heat records for 15 months in a row and that water heat, along with an unusually warm Antarctica, are helping push temperatures to record level, Buontempo said.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised to see Thursday, Friday and Saturday also set new warmest day records,\" said climate scientist Andrew Weaver at the University of Victoria in Canada, which has been broiling in the warmth.\n\nBorenstein reported from Washington.\n\nFollow Sibi Arasu on X at @sibi123 and Seth Borenstein at @borenbears\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

number of workers face exposure to heat stress, the UN said Thursday, with climate change swelling the risks in regions unaccustomed to extreme heat like Europe and Central Asia.\n\nData from the United Nations' International Labour Organization shows that more than 70 percent of the global workforce was exposed to excessive heat during 2020 -- up nearly nine percent from the year 2000.\n\nIn a fresh report breaking down the heat stress by region, ILO showed unexpectedly that Africa was hardest hit, with nearly 93 percent of workers suffering from excessive heat exposure on the job, followed by the Arab states at 83.6 percent and Asia and the Pacific at 74.7 percent.\n\nBut at a time when human-induced climate change is seen driving global temperatures ever higher, with last year by far the hottest ever recorded, the fastest changing working conditions were seen in regions not traditionally impacted by extreme heat.\n\nExcessive heat exposure at work swelled the most in Europe and Central Asia, jumping 17.3 percent over the 20-year period to 29 percent, the ILO report found.\n\nAt the same time, the Americas, along with Europe and Central Asia, were found to have the most rapidly increasing proportion of heat-related occupational injuries, swelling 33.3 and 16.4 percent respectively over the two decades.\n\n\"Countries previously unaccustomed to extreme heat will face unfamiliar threats which they may be ill-equipped to deal with, while conditions in regions already contending with sustained high temperatures will only deteriorate,\" the report said.\n\nAt a global level, nearly 23 million occupational injuries attributed to excessive heat are reported each year, costing, on estimate, nearly 19,000 lives annually, the ILO said in a report published earlier this year.\n\nAt the time, it warned that climate change and excessive heat brought \"a cocktail of hazards\" for workers.\n\n\"Heat is an invisible force -- a silent killer,\" Tuesday's report cautioned.\n\nIt said heat hazards both for indoor and outdoor work increase the \"risk of health impacts such as heat exhaustion, heat stroke, cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, and death\".\n\n\"As record-breaking temperatures continue across various regions, more workers than ever before are losing the fight against excessive heat.\"\n\nThe report highlighted the impact of heat waves, which account for about 10 percent of overall excessive heat exposure globally, and which it said had cost 4,200 workers their lives in 2020.\n\nIn total, 231 million workers were exposed to heat waves that year -- a 66-percent hike from 2000.\n\nEurope, Central Asia and the Americas saw the fastest increase in exposure to excessive heat on the job during heat waves, with around 78.5 percent of such exposure happening during heat waves, the ILO report said.\n\n\"Excessive heat is creating unprecedented challenges for workers worldwide year-round, and not only during periods of intense heat waves,\" Vera Paquete-Perdigao, head of ILO's governance department which produced the report, said in a statement.\n\nManal Azzi, head of ILO's occupational safety and health division, called for action.\n\n\"We need year-round heat action plans and legislation to protect workers, and stronger global collaboration among experts to harmonize heat stress assessments and interventions at work,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the report, improved safety and health measures to prevent injuries from excessive heat in the workplace could save up to $361 billion globally in lost income and medical treatment expenses.", "source": {"uri": "phys.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Phys.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki",

The second hottest day? The day before. Heat records have never tumbled at such speed before and it could have dire consequences for people everywhere, especially Europe which is the fastest warming continent on Earth.\n\nThe EU's climate service Copernicus calculated that the global average temperature on Monday was 17.16 Celsius, narrowly topping the previous record set just a day before when it was 17.09 C. Tuesday was then 17.15 C.\n\nAll of these temperatures beat the record set just last year on 6 July by 0.01\u00b0C. All of these obliterate the previous record of 16.8\u00b0C, which itself was only a few years old, set in 2016.\n\nThe Earth would not be heating up so fast if fossil fuels were not being burned at such a rate, leading to human-caused global warming.\n\n'Heat is a killer'\n\n\"The steady drumbeat of hottest-day-ever records and near-records is concerning for three main reasons. The first is that heat is a killer.\n\nThe second is that the health impacts of heat waves become much more serious when events persist.\n\nThe third is that the hottest-day records this year are a surprise,\" says Stanford University climate scientist Chris Field.\n\nField said high temperatures usually occur during El Ni\u00f1o years - a natural warming of the equatorial Pacific that triggers weather extremes across the globe - but the last El Ni\u00f1o ended in April.\n\nField said these high temperatures \"underscores the seriousness of the climate crisis.\"\n\n\"This has been, I mean, probably the shortest-lived record ever,\" Copernicus Director Carlo Buontempo said Wednesday, after his agency calculated that Monday had beaten Sunday's mark. And he predicted that mark would also quickly fall. \"We are in uncharted territory.\"\n\nPrevious record has been beaten 59 times in 13 months\n\nBefore 3 July 2023, the hottest day measured by Copernicus was 16.8 C on 13 August, 2016. In the last 13 months that mark has now been beaten 59 times, according to Copernicus.\n\nHumanity is now \"operating in a world that is already much warmer than it was before,\" Buontempo said.\n\n\"Unfortunately people are going to die and those deaths are preventable,\" said Kristie Ebi, a public health and climate professor at the University of Washington. \"Heat is called the silent killer for a reason. People often don't know they're in trouble with heat until it's too late.\"\n\nMost heat deaths in more than 80 years\n\nIn past heatwaves, including in 2021 in the Pacific Northwest, heat deaths didn't start piling up until day two, Ebi said.\n\n\"At some point, the accumulated heat internally becomes too much, then your cells and your organs start to warm up,\" Ebi said.\n\nLast year, the United States had its most recorded heat deaths in more than 80 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. The death certificates of more than 2,300 people mentioned excessive heat.\n\nEarlier this year, India witnessed prolonged heatwaves that resulted in the death of at least a 100 people. However, health experts say heat deaths are likely undercounted in India and potentially other countries.\n\nThe \"big driver\" of the current heat is greenhouse gas emissions, from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Buontempo said. Those gases help trap heat, changing the energy balance between the heat coming in from the sun and that escaping Earth, meaning the planet retains more heat energy than before, he said.\n\nOther factors include the warming of the Pacific by El Nino; the sun reaching its peak cycle of activity; an undersea volcano explosion; and air with fewer heat-reflecting particles because of marine fuel pollution regulations, experts said.\n\nThe last 13 months have all set heat records. The world's oceans broke heat records for 15 months in a row and that water heat, along with an unusually warm Antarctica, are helping push temperatures to record level, Buontempo said.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised to see Thursday, Friday and Saturday also set new warmest day records,\" said climate scientist Andrew Weaver at the University of Victoria in Canada, which has been broiling in the warmth.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus", "type":

That's 122 degrees Fahrenheit -- and halfway to boiling,\" he said at a news conference here on Thursday.\n\n\"This past Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday were the three hottest days on record,\" he said, citing Copernicus Climate Change Service data.\n\n\"Heat is estimated to kill almost half a million people a year, that's about 30 times more than tropical cyclones,\" he added.\n\n\"Extreme heat amplifies inequality, inflames food insecurity, and pushes people further into poverty,\" he said.\n\nGuterres called for action in four areas to ameliorate the effects of the heatwaves sweeping the world: Care for the most vulnerable; increased protection for workers; boost the resilience of economies and societies, and action to fight climate change by committing to keep temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.\n\nTo protect the most vulnerable, he said, \"We must respond by massively increasing access to low-carbon cooling; expanding passive cooling - such as natural solutions and urban design; and cleaning up cooling technologies while boosting their efficiency.\"\n\nHe referred to a report from the International Labour Organisation on the effect of heat on workers released on Thursday that warned that more than 70 per cent of the global workforce - 2.4 billion people - are now at high risk of extreme heat.\n\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, three out of four workers are exposed to extreme heat, it said.\n\nGuterres said, \"All of this is having a profound impact on people and the economy.\"\n\nWhen daily temperatures rise above 34 degrees, labour productivity drops by 50 per cent and heat stress at work is projected to cost the global economy $2.4 trillion by 2030, up from $280 billion in the mid-1990s,\" he added.\n\nHe called for worker protection measures and said, \"We must ensure that laws and regulations reflect the reality of extreme heat today and are enforced.\"\n\nTo build resilience against increasing heat, he said, \"We need a concerted effort to heatproof economies, critical sectors, and the built environment.\"\n\nHe added, \"Countries, cities, and sectors need comprehensive, tailored Heat Action Plans, based on the best science and data.\"\n\nWhile today, the focus is on the impact of extreme heat, \"there are many other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: Ever-more fierce hurricanes... Floods... Droughts... Wildfires... Rising sea levels,\" he said.\n\n\"To tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease\" which he said were \"the addiction to fossil fuels,\" and \"climate inaction\".\n\n\"All countries must deliver by next year nationally determined contributions - or national climate action plans - aligned to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius,\" he added.\n\nHe said all countries must phase out fossil fuels \"fast and fairly,\" coal in particular, and towards that goal cut global consumption and production of fossil fuels by 30 per cent by 2030.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"We must recognise that a lot is being done.\"\n\n\"The increase of renewable energy we are witnessing is the fastest increase of energy production by any means in history,\" he added.\n\nWhile many things like increasing the number of electric cars are happening, it is \"too little, too late,\" he said.\n\n\"The problem is that climate change is running faster than all the measures that are now being put in place to fight it. And that is why it is important to understand that we need a huge acceleration of all the dimensions of climate action,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Copernicus, the daily global average temperature recorded across oceans and land saw records tumble at 17.09 degrees Celsius on Sunday, and on Monday at 17.16 degrees, and on Tuesday hold almost steady at 17.15 degrees.\n\nThe previous record set last year on July 6 was 17.08 degrees. (The temperatures may appear low because they aggregate the readings in the hottest regions and the coldest polar regions, but in fact, show marked increases over time. In the 10-year range, 15.72 degrees was the highest temperature for the year recorded on July 11, 1975.)\n\n(Arul Louis can be contacted at arul.l@ians.in and followed at @arulouis)", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus_Climate_Change_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copernicus Climate Change Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_cooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passive cooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Built environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyperthermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicolaus Copernicus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/202407263193226.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 16, "textEnd": 23}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 4113, "textEnd": 4119}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-07-", "textStart": 4397, "textEnd": 4404}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Extreme heat is having an extreme impact on people and planet. The world must rise to the challenge of rising temperatures.\"\n\nThe UN chief highlighted that while \"crippling heat is everywhere\", it does not affect everyone equally.\n\nThose most at risk include the urban poor, pregnant women, children, older persons, those with disabilities, the sick, and the displaced, who often live in substandard housing without access to cooling.\n\nAccording to UN estimates, heat-related deaths for people over 65 years of age increased by about 85 per cent over the past two decades, while 25 per cent of all children today are exposed to frequent heatwaves and by 2050, that could rise to almost 100 per cent.\n\n\"We must respond by massively increasing access to low-carbon cooling, expanding passive cooling - such as natural solutions and urban design and cleaning up cooling technologies while boosting their efficiency,\" Mr. Guterres said, calling for scaling up of finances to protect communities from \"climate chaos\".\n\nMr. Guterres also underscored the need to step up protections for workers.\n\nOver 70 per cent of the global workforce, or 2.4 billion people, are at substantial risk of extreme heat, according to new report from the UN International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\nThe situation is particularly dire in the Africa and Arab regions, where more than 90 per cent and 80 per cent of workers are exposed, respectively. In Asia and the Pacific - the world's most populous region - that figure is three in four workers (75 per cent).\n\nIn addition, heat stress at work is projected to cost the global economy $2.4 trillion by 2030, up from $280 billion in the mid-1990s.\n\n\"We need measures to protect workers, grounded in human rights,\" Mr. Guterres stressed.\n\n\"And we must ensure that laws and regulations reflect the reality of extreme heat today - and are enforced.\"\n\nHe also underscored the need to strengthen resilience of economies and societies, citing impacts such as infrastructure damage, crop failures, and increased pressure on water supplies, health systems, and electricity grids.\n\nCities are particularly vulnerable, experiencing heating at twice the global average rate.\n\nTo address these challenges, Mr. Guterres called for comprehensive and tailored action plans based on scientific data are essential for countries, cities and sectors.\n\n\"We need a concerted effort to heatproof economies, critical sectors and the built environment.\"\n\nThe UN chief reiterated that it is crucial to recognize the myriad symptoms beyond extreme heat, such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires and rising sea levels.\n\nThe core issue is the reliance on fossil fuels and climate inaction, he stated, stressing that governments, especially G20 nations, the private sector, cities and regions, must urgently adopt climate action plans to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nAlongside, countries must urgently phase-out fossil fuels and end new coal projects.", "source":

Las Vegas broke its all-time heat record at 120 F (48.9 C). Days of 100-degree heat dried out the California landscapes, fueling wildfires there and in the Northwest. Oregon reported several suspected heat deaths.\n\nGlobally, the planet had its hottest day in at least eight decades of recordkeeping on July 21 - and then broke the record again on July 22, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nThe extreme heat is part of a longer trend: Each of the past 13 months has been the hottest on record for that month globally, including the hottest June, the EU service reported in early July. It also found that the average temperature for the previous 12 months had been at least 1.5 C (2.7 F) warmer than the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average.\n\nThe 1.5 C warming threshold can be confusing, so let's take a closer look at what that means. In the Paris climate agreement, countries worldwide agreed to work to keep global warming under 1.5 C, however that refers to the temperature change averaged over a 30-year period. A 30-year average is used to limit the influence of natural year-to-year fluctuations.\n\nSo far, the Earth has only crossed that threshold for a single year. However, it is still extremely concerning. We study weather patterns involving heat. The world appears to be on track to cross the 30-year average threshold of 1.5 C within 10 years.\n\nHeat is becoming a global problem\n\nSeveral countries have experienced record heat across the Americas, Africa, Europe and Asia in 2024. In Mexico and Central America, weeks of persistent heat starting in spring 2024 combined with prolonged drought led to severe water shortages and dozens of deaths.\n\nExtreme heat turned into tragedy in Saudi Arabia, as over 1,000 people on the Hajj, a Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, collapsed and died. Temperatures reached 125 F (51.8 C) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on June 17.\n\nHospitals in Karachi, Pakistan, were overwhelmed amid weeks of high heat, frequent power outages, and water shortages in some areas. Neighboring India faced temperatures around 120 F (48.9 C) for several days in April and May that affected millions of people, many of them without air conditioning.\n\nJapan issued heatstroke alerts in Tokyo and more than half of its prefectures as temperatures rose to record highs in early July.\n\nLarge parts of Europe were suffering through a long-running heat wave as the 2024 Summer Olympics prepared to open in Paris in late July.\n\nThe climate connection: This isn't 'just summer'\n\nAlthough heat waves are a natural part of the climate, the severity and extent of the heat waves so far in 2024 are not \"just summer.\"\n\nA scientific assessment of the fierce heat wave in the eastern U.S. in June 2024 estimates that heat so severe and long-lasting was two to four times more likely to occur today because of human-caused climate change than it would have been without it. This conclusion is consistent with the rapid increase over the past several decades in the number of U.S. heat waves and their occurrence outside the peak of summer.\n\nThese record heat waves are happening in a climate that's globally more than 2.2 F (1.2 C) warmer - when looking at the 30-year average - than it was before the industrial revolution, when humans began releasing large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions that warm the climate.\n\nWhile a temperature difference of a degree or two when you walk into a different room might not even be noticeable, even fractions of a degree make a large difference in the global climate.\n\nAt the peak of the last ice age, some 20,000 years ago, when the Northeast U.S. was under thousands of feet of ice, the globally averaged temperature was only about 11 F (6 C) cooler than now. So, it is not surprising that 2.2 F (1.2 C) of warming so far is already rapidly changing the climate.\n\nIf you thought this was hot\n\nWhile this summer is likely be one of the hottest on record, it is important to realize that it may also be one of the coldest summers of the future.\n\nFor populations that are especially vulnerable to heat, including young children, older adults and outdoor workers, the risks are even higher. People in lower-income neighborhoods where air conditioning may be unaffordable and renters who often don't have the same protections for cooling as heating will face increasingly dangerous conditions.\n\nExtreme heat can also affect economies. It can buckle railroad tracks and cause wires to sag, leading to transit delays and disruptions. It can also overload electric systems with high demand and lead to blackouts just when people have the greatest need for cooling.\n\nThe good news: There are solutions\n\nYes, the future in a warming world is daunting. However, while countries aren't on pace to meet their Paris Agreement goals, they have made progress.\n\nIn the U.S., the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act has the potential to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half by 2035.\n\nSwitching from air conditioners to heat pumps and network geothermal systems can not only reduce fossil fuel emissions but also provide cooling at a lower cost. The cost of renewable energy continues to plummet, and many countries are increasing policy support and incentives.\n\nThere is much that humanity can do to limit future warming if countries, companies and people everywhere act with urgency. Rapidly reducing fossil fuel emissions can help avoid a warmer future with even worse heat waves and droughts, while also providing other benefits, including improving public health, creating jobs and reducing risks to ecosystems.\n\nThis is an update to an article originally published on June 26, 2024.\n\nMathew Barlow has received funding from the NOAA Modeling, Analysis, Predictions and

And halfway to boiling.\"\n\nAccording to the European Copernicus network, July 21, 22 and 23 were the three hottest days ever recorded worldwide, with July 22 holding the absolute record of 17.16 degrees Celsius (62.9 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nGuterres repeated his call for humanity to fight its \"addiction\" to fossil fuels.\n\n\"Today, our focus is on the impact of extreme heat. But let's not forget that there are many other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: ever-more fierce hurricanes. Floods. Droughts. Wildfires. Rising sea levels. And the list goes on,\" he said.\n\n\"To tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease. And the disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction,\" he stressed, calling in particular on G20 countries to take action.\n\nWhile 2023 was the hottest year on record, and 2024 could set a new record, temperatures well above 40C (104F) are increasingly common.\n\nIn the space of a year, the 50C threshold has even been exceeded in at least 10 places, from Death Valley in the United States (53.9C on July 7) to Agadir in Morocco, and also in China and India.\n\nThe intense heat, often less visible than other devastating impacts of climate change such as storms or floods, is nonetheless more deadly.\n\nThis \"silent killer\" is responsible for around 489,000 deaths per year between 2000 and 2019, compared with 16,000 deaths per year from cyclones, according to the UN's \"Call to Action\" document published on Thursday.\n\nExtremely high temperatures also have an economic impact, with the UN estimating economic losses from heat stress at work will reach $2.4 trillion in 2030.\n\nAccording to a report by the International Labor Organization published on Thursday, more than 70 percent of workers were exposed to excessive heat in 2020, 8.8 percent more than in 2000.\n\n\"The good news is that we can save lives and we can limit its impact,\" Guterres said Thursday.\n\nThe UN has called for the world community to first act to protect \"the most vulnerable\" -- including young children, the elderly and also humanity's poorest.\n\nIn this context, early warning systems should include extreme heat, warning populations of the arrival of heat waves and informing them of the precautions to take, the document says.\n\nThe call to action also recommends an \"increase (to) equitable access to and scale up (of) low-carbon cooling.\"\n\nThis would involve investing in passive cooling systems -- which include climate-sensitive urban design measures, reflective surfaces and natural cooling systems -- and the phase-out of climate-warming gases that are used in many cooling systems.", "source":

That is, until Monday, when global temperatures inched up a bit more. Then Monday became the hottest day in modern history, with an average global temperature of 17.16 Celsius or 62.88 Fahrenheit. Tuesday was almost as hot.\n\nThe records shouldn't come as a complete surprise. Earth tends to be at its warmest during the Northern Hemisphere's summer. The previous record for the planet's warmest day came last July.\n\nBut what stunned scientists wasn't the temperature of the hottest day ever recorded, which was up slightly from last year, it was how much hotter than usual it's been during the rest of the year, between these two summer peaks. Instead of returning to something close to normal, average global surface temperatures have remained stubbornly high for more than a year now.\n\n\"What is truly staggering is how large the difference is between the temperature of the last 13 months and the previous temperature records,\" said Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus. \"We are now in truly uncharted territory, and as the climate keeps warming, we are bound to see new records being broken in future months and years.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary general of the U.N., addressed the global heat wave and called for new efforts to protect the vulnerable and workers, as well as to make population centers more resilient.\n\n\"Let's face facts,\" he said. \"Extreme temperatures are no longer a one-day, one-week or one-month phenomenon. If there is one thing that unites our divided world, it's that we're all increasingly feeling the heat. Earth is becoming hotter and more dangerous for everyone, everywhere.\"\n\nAnd Guterres, who has emerged as an outspoken critic of the oil, coal and gas industries, left no doubts about the cause. \"We know what is driving it: fossil fuel-charged, human-induced climate change,\" he said. \"And we know it's going to get worse.\"\n\nExtreme heat is killing people around the globe. There have been hundreds of heat-related deaths this year in Maricopa County, Ariz., which includes Phoenix. Temperatures there hit 118 degrees Fahrenheit this month.\n\nIn many cities, the sidewalks are hot enough to give people contact burns. The extreme heat is not just limited to desert cities, either: Sacramento and Portland, Ore., are also withering under the heat, and officials there are working on plans to increase tree cover and provide portable cooling units to vulnerable residents.\n\nAs Damien Cave and Somini Sengupta reported recently, extreme heat is leading to catastrophes at large gatherings. At least 1,300 people died at this year's hajj, an Islamic pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, as temperatures reached 120 degrees. It's expected to be sweltering during the upcoming Olympics in Paris, posing potential risks for athletes.\n\nIn India, dozens of poll workers died on the job during recent elections. And at music festivals in Australia, Europe and North America, concertgoers have become sick from heat. The frequency of heat-related mass casualty events has prompted India to create new heatstroke wards in big hospitals and educate local officials about how to prepare for extreme temperatures.\n\nBut the recent records weren't just fueled by record heat in populated areas. Many of the most unusually warm places on Earth were near the poles.\n\n\"The sudden rise in daily global average temperature is related to much above-average temperatures over large parts of Antarctica,\" according to Copernicus. That heat has lowered Antarctic sea ice levels, which, in turn, is heating up the Southern Ocean.\n\nRemote regions near the North Pole -- including areas of Canada, Russia and Greenland -- are also experiencing above average temperatures.\n\n\"Extreme heat is the new abnormal,\" Guterres said. While global average temperatures may come down a bit in the weeks and months ahead, the brutal math of climate change means that as long as the world keeps burning fossil fuels at a high rate, Earth is going to keep getting hotter.\n\nGiven that stark reality, Guterres called on countries to ramp up their efforts to protect the vulnerable. While the U.N. secretary general has little power himself, he encouraged governments to increase access to cooling stations, introduce better excessive-heat warning systems and pass laws that protect workers who are exposed to high temperatures. This month, President Biden introduced new proposed regulations to protect workers from heat.\n\nThose are but some of the measures that could help. Cities including Lisbon and Medell\u00edn, Colombia, have managed to reduce urban temperatures by planting millions of new trees and shrubs. Other cities are painting rooftops and sidewalks white to reflect heat.\n\nAnd for those stuck in a heat wave, there are simple ways to reduce your body heat, including blocking your windows from the sun and spritzing your skin with water.\n\n\"Today, our focus is on the impact of extreme heat,\" Guterres said. \"But let's not forget that there are many other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: Ever-more fierce hurricanes. Floods. Droughts. Wildfires. Rising sea levels. The list goes on. To tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease. And the disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction.\"\n\nWhere Harris's potential running mates stand on climate issues\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has a long history as a climate-minded politician.\n\nAs California's attorney general, she prosecuted polluters, and as a U.S. senator, she cosponsored the Green New Deal, a resolution that called on the nation to pivot away from fossil fuels but that never passed Congress. During her time as vice president, Harris helped broker the largest climate deal in U.S. history, the $370 billion Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\n\nNow, her choice of running mate could help bolster her climate and energy agenda, or moderate her stance for voters in swing states.\n\nSo, where do some of the top contenders stand?

Responding to another question, the ministry said that heat wave deaths are reducing in the country due to better weather prediction.\n\nModelled estimates show that between the years 2000 and 2019, approximately 489,000 heat-related deaths occurred each year, with 45% of these in Asia and 36% in Europe, the UN further said.\n\nHeat exposure-related loss in labour capacity resulted in average potential income losses equivalent to US$863 billion in 2022, it said.\n\n\"Secretary-General is issuing a global call to action on extreme heat in four critical areas: Care for the vulnerable; protect workers; boost the resilience of our economies and societies using data and science, and limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C. Extreme heat impacts virtually everything we do, and every aspect of our lives,\" the report read.\n\nNew data from the International Labour Organization (ILO) warns that over 70% of the global workforce - 2.4 billion people - are now at high risk of extreme heat, resulting in 22.85 million injuries and 18,970 deaths annually among workers. \"Workers in Africa, the Arab states, and Asia and the Asia-Pacific are most exposed to excessive heat. In these regions, 93 per cent, 84 per cent, and 75% of the workforce are affected, respectively As daily temperatures rise above 34\u00b0C, labour productivity begins to drop by 50%,\" the report said.\n\nA triple strategy of passive cooling, higher energy efficiency and fast phasedown of climate-warming refrigerants offers the opportunity to reduce emissions from the cooling sector while protecting an additional 3.5 billion people at risk from heat by 2050, the UN said.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects that peak temperatures in heat waves will increase significantly faster than global mean and local average temperatures. An extreme heat event that would have occurred once in 50 years in a climate without human influence is now nearly five times more likely. Such an event is projected to be nearly 9 times more likely under 1.5\u00b0C and 14 times more likely under 2\u00b0C and bring heat and humidity levels that are far more dangerous, UN has flagged.\n\nUNICEF found that by 2050, if the current trend continues, almost every child under 18 in the world - nearly 2.2 billion - will be exposed to high heat wave frequency, up from only 24% of children in 2020. Heat-related mortality for people over 65 years of age increased by approximately 85% between 2000-2004 and 2018-2022.\n\nThe UN has recommended that countries adopt evidence-based policies, regulations multi-dimensional risk assessments and community-driven actions to protect the most vulnerable; enhance social protection schemes to integrate specific measures that help address the risks of extreme heat; implement urgent measures to protect the health and lives of all workers in all sectors and in all regions of the world from the risk of extreme heat through a rights-based approach; urgently review the laws and regulations on occupational safety and health to integrate provisions for extreme heat; develop and implement comprehensive, risk-informed heat action plans (and cooling plans) in all countries and all sectors among others.\n\n\"Every fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes, impacts and risks become larger. Limiting global warming to below 1.5\u00b0C will significantly reduce the risks, adverse impacts and related human suffering from climate change, including extreme heat,\" the report added.\n\nIt was the warmest June for northwest India since record-keeping began in 1901 according to the India Meteorological Department. The mean temperature in June was 31.73\u00b0C C, 1.65\u00b0C above normal. The average maximum temperature over the region was 38.2\u00b0C, nearly 2\u00b0C above normal and even the minimum temperature was the second highest since 1901 at 25.44\u00b0C, 1.35\u00b0C above normal.\n\nThere were reports of at least 100 deaths from different parts of north India this summer. The Centre, however, has not released the data.\n\nEast and northeast India also recorded its warmest June in terms of nighttime temperatures, recording an average minimum temperature of 25.14\u00b0C, nearly 1\u00b0C above normal.\n\nCompared to a normal of 3-4 days of heat wave, parts of Indo-Gangetic plains, northwest India, central and north India recorded a range of 10 to 18 heat wave days in June.\n\nUttar Pradesh recorded 18 heat wave days; Bihar 13; Gangetic West Bengal nine; Delhi, Haryana region recorded 14; Punjab 11; Himachal Pradesh 10 days, among others.\n\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department, between April to June, 20 to 38 days of heat waves days were recorded in different parts of east, north and central India Most frequent heat waves (20-38 days) were recorded over Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, West and East UP and Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Saurashtra and Kutch. The deadly heat spell recorded over Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and other parts of northwest India killed at least 100 people.\n\nIn April, east and southeast peninsular India saw an intense spell of humid heat (between April 5 and 7), and Odisha and West Bengal, one between April 15 and 30, which expanded over days to Bihar, Jharkhand and south peninsular India.\n\nIn May, Odisha, Gangetic West Bengal and parts of peninsular India saw an intense spell of heat (between May 1 and 7), Rajasthan, between May 16 and 26, with 9-12 days that were classified either a heat wave or a severe heat wave (with temperatures nearing 50 \u00b0C on some days), and Delhi and the National Capital Region, Haryana, southwest Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, also between May 16 and 26, with five to seven days that were classified a heat wave, with temperatures between 44\u00b0C and 48\u00b0C.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(File)\n\nUnited Nations:\n\nHumanity is grappling with an \"extreme heat epidemic,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres announced on Thursday, urging prompt actions to mitigate the effects of heat waves exacerbated by climate change.\n\n\"Billions of people are enduring an extreme heat epidemic, suffering under increasingly deadly heat waves, with global temperatures soaring past 50 degrees Celsius,\" he stated. \"That's 122 degrees Fahrenheit. And halfway to boiling.\"\n\nThe European Copernicus network reported that July 21, 22, and 23 were the hottest days ever recorded globally, with July 22 setting the record at 17.16 degrees Celsius (62.9 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nGuterres reiterated his plea for humanity to overcome its dependency on fossil fuels.\n\n\"Today, we focus on the impact of extreme heat. However, let's not overlook the numerous other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: increasingly fierce hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires, rising sea levels, and more,\" he emphasized.\n\n\"To address all these symptoms, we must tackle the underlying disease: the madness of destroying our only home. The disease is our addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction,\" he urged, particularly calling on G20 nations to take action.\n\nWhile 2023 marked the hottest year on record, 2024 could surpass it, with temperatures consistently exceeding 40C (104F).\n\nIn the past year alone, the 50C threshold was surpassed at least 10 times, including in locations such as Death Valley in the United States (53.9C on July 7), Agadir in Morocco, and regions in China and India.\n\nThe extreme heat, often less visible than other climate change impacts like storms or floods, is nevertheless more lethal.\n\nThis \"silent killer\" accounts for approximately 489,000 deaths annually between 2000 and 2019, compared to 16,000 deaths per year from cyclones, according to the UN's \"Call to Action\" document released on Thursday.\n\nWorkers at Risk\n\nExcessive temperatures also bear economic consequences, with the UN projecting economic losses from heat stress at work to reach $2.4 trillion by 2030.\n\nA report by the International Labor Organization published on Thursday revealed that over 70 percent of workers were exposed to extreme heat in 2020, an 8.8 percent increase since 2000.\n\n\"The good news is that we can save lives and limit its impact,\" Guterres reiterated on Thursday.\n\nThe UN has called on the global community to prioritize protecting \"the most vulnerable\" -- including young children, the elderly, and the impoverished.\n\nIn this regard, early warning systems should encompass extreme heat, alerting populations about impending heat waves and advising on necessary precautions, the document suggests.\n\nThe call to action also advocates for enhancing equitable access to and scaling up low-carbon cooling solutions.\n\nThis involves investing in passive cooling systems, which include climate-sensitive urban design, reflective surfaces, natural cooling systems, and phasing out climate-warming gases used in many cooling devices.", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in",

That is, until Monday, when global temperatures inched up a bit more. Then Monday became the hottest day in modern history, with an average global temperature of 17.16 Celsius or 62.88 Fahrenheit. Tuesday was almost as hot.\n\nThe records shouldn't come as a complete surprise. Earth tends to be at its warmest during the Northern Hemisphere's summer. The previous record for the planet's warmest day came last July.\n\nBut what stunned scientists wasn't the temperature of the hottest day ever recorded, which was up slightly from last year, it was how much hotter than usual it's been during the rest of the year, between these two summer peaks. Instead of returning to something close to normal, average global surface temperatures have remained stubbornly high for more than a year now.\n\n\"What is truly staggering is how large the difference is between the temperature of the last 13 months and the previous temperature records,\" said Carlo Buontempo, director of Copernicus. \"We are now in truly uncharted territory, and as the climate keeps warming, we are bound to see new records being broken in future months and years.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary general of the U.N., addressed the global heat wave and called for new efforts to protect the vulnerable and workers, as well as to make population centers more resilient.\n\n\"Let's face facts,\" he said. \"Extreme temperatures are no longer a one-day, one-week or one-month phenomenon. If there is one thing that unites our divided world, it's that we're all increasingly feeling the heat. Earth is becoming hotter and more dangerous for everyone, everywhere.\"\n\nAnd Guterres, who has emerged as an outspoken critic of the oil, coal and gas industries, left no doubts about the cause. \"We know what is driving it: fossil fuel-charged, human-induced climate change,\" he said. \"And we know it's going to get worse.\"\n\nExtreme heat is killing people around the globe. There have been hundreds of heat-related deaths this year in Maricopa County, Ariz., which includes Phoenix. Temperatures there hit 118 degrees Fahrenheit this month.\n\nIn many cities, the sidewalks are hot enough to give people contact burns. The extreme heat is not just limited to desert cities, either: Sacramento and Portland, Ore., are also withering under the heat, and officials there are working on plans to increase tree cover and provide portable cooling units to vulnerable residents.\n\nAs Damien Cave and Somini Sengupta reported recently, extreme heat is leading to catastrophes at large gatherings. At least 1,300 people died at this year's hajj, an Islamic pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, as temperatures reached 120 degrees. It's expected to be sweltering during the upcoming Olympics in Paris, posing potential risks for athletes.\n\nIn India, dozens of poll workers died on the job during recent elections. And at music festivals in Australia, Europe and North America, concertgoers have become sick from heat. The frequency of heat-related mass casualty events has prompted India to create new heatstroke wards in big hospitals and educate local officials about how to prepare for extreme temperatures.\n\nBut the recent records weren't just fueled by record heat in populated areas. Many of the most unusually warm places on Earth were near the poles.\n\n\"The sudden rise in daily global average temperature is related to much above-average temperatures over large parts of Antarctica,\" according to Copernicus. That heat has lowered Antarctic sea ice levels, which, in turn, is heating up the Southern Ocean.\n\nRemote regions near the North Pole -- including areas of Canada, Russia and Greenland -- are also experiencing above average temperatures.\n\n\"Extreme heat is the new abnormal,\" Guterres said. While global average temperatures may come down a bit in the weeks and months ahead, the brutal math of climate change means that as long as the world keeps burning fossil fuels at a high rate, Earth is going to keep getting hotter.\n\nGiven that stark reality, Guterres called on countries to ramp up their efforts to protect the vulnerable. While the U.N. secretary general has little power himself, he encouraged governments to increase access to cooling stations, introduce better excessive-heat warning systems and pass laws that protect workers who are exposed to high temperatures. This month, President Biden introduced new proposed regulations to protect workers from heat.\n\nThose are but some of the measures that could help. Cities including Lisbon and Medell\u00edn, Colombia, have managed to reduce urban temperatures by planting millions of new trees and shrubs. Other cities are painting rooftops and sidewalks white to reflect heat.\n\nAnd for those stuck in a heat wave, there are simple ways to reduce your body heat, including blocking your windows from the sun and spritzing your skin with water.\n\n\"Today, our focus is on the impact of extreme heat,\" Guterres said. \"But let's not forget that there are many other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: Ever-more fierce hurricanes. Floods. Droughts. Wildfires. Rising sea levels. The list goes on. To tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease. And the disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has a long history as a climate-minded politician.\n\nAs California's attorney general, she prosecuted polluters, and as a U.S. senator, she cosponsored the Green New Deal, a resolution that called on the nation to pivot away from fossil fuels but that never passed Congress. During her time as vice president, Harris helped broker the largest climate deal in U.S. history, the $370 billion Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\n\nNow, her choice of running mate could help bolster her climate and energy agenda, or moderate her stance for voters in swing states.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Las Vegas broke its all-time heat record at 120 F (48.9 C). Days of 100-degree heat dried out the California landscapes, fueling wildfires there and in the Northwest. Oregon reported several suspected heat deaths.\n\nGlobally, the planet had its hottest day in at least eight decades of recordkeeping on July 21 - and then broke the record again on July 22, according to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nThe extreme heat is part of a longer trend: Each of the past 13 months has been the hottest on record for that month globally, including the hottest June, the EU service reported in early July. It also found that the average temperature for the previous 12 months had been at least 1.5 C (2.7 F) warmer than the 1850-1900 pre-industrial average.\n\nThe 1.5 C warming threshold can be confusing, so let's take a closer look at what that means. In the Paris climate agreement, countries worldwide agreed to work to keep global warming under 1.5 C, however that refers to the temperature change averaged over a 30-year period. A 30-year average is used to limit the influence of natural year-to-year fluctuations.\n\nSo far, the Earth has only crossed that threshold for a single year. However, it is still extremely concerning. We study weather patterns involving heat. The world appears to be on track to cross the 30-year average threshold of 1.5 C within 10 years.\n\nSeveral countries have experienced record heat across the Americas, Africa, Europe and Asia in 2024. In Mexico and Central America, weeks of persistent heat starting in spring 2024 combined with prolonged drought led to severe water shortages and dozens of deaths.\n\nExtreme heat turned into tragedy in Saudi Arabia, as over 1,000 people on the Hajj, a Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, collapsed and died. Temperatures reached 125 F (51.8 C) at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on June 17.\n\nHospitals in Karachi, Pakistan, were overwhelmed amid weeks of high heat, frequent power outages, and water shortages in some areas. Neighboring India faced temperatures around 120 F (48.9 C) for several days in April and May that affected millions of people, many of them without air conditioning.\n\nJapan issued heatstroke alerts in Tokyo and more than half of its prefectures as temperatures rose to record highs in early July.\n\nLarge parts of Europe were suffering through a long-running heat wave as the 2024 Summer Olympics prepared to open in Paris in late July.\n\nAlthough heat waves are a natural part of the climate, the severity and extent of the heat waves so far in 2024 are not \"just summer.\"\n\nA scientific assessment of the fierce heat wave in the eastern U.S. in June 2024 estimates that heat so severe and long-lasting was two to four times more likely to occur today because of human-caused climate change than it would have been without it. This conclusion is consistent with the rapid increase over the past several decades in the number of U.S. heat waves and their occurrence outside the peak of summer.\n\nThese record heat waves are happening in a climate that's globally more than 2.2 F (1.2 C) warmer - when looking at the 30-year average - than it was before the industrial revolution, when humans began releasing large amounts of greenhouse gas emissions that warm the climate.\n\nWhile a temperature difference of a degree or two when you walk into a different room might not even be noticeable, even fractions of a degree make a large difference in the global climate.\n\nAt the peak of the last ice age, some 20,000 years ago, when the Northeast U.S. was under thousands of feet of ice, the globally averaged temperature was only about 11 F (6 C) cooler than now. So, it is not surprising that 2.2 F (1.2 C) of warming so far is already rapidly changing the climate.\n\nWhile this summer is likely be one of the hottest on record, it is important to realize that it may also be one of the coldest summers of the future.\n\nFor populations that are especially vulnerable to heat, including young children, older adults and outdoor workers, the risks are even higher. People in lower-income neighborhoods where air conditioning may be unaffordable and renters who often don't have the same protections for cooling as heating will face increasingly dangerous conditions.\n\nExtreme heat can also affect economies. It can buckle railroad tracks and cause wires to sag, leading to transit delays and disruptions. It can also overload electric systems with high demand and lead to blackouts just when people have the greatest need for cooling.\n\nYes, the future in a warming world is daunting. However, while countries aren't on pace to meet their Paris Agreement goals, they have made progress.\n\nIn the U.S., the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act has the potential to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by nearly half by 2035.\n\nSwitching from air conditioners to heat pumps and network geothermal systems can not only reduce fossil fuel emissions but also provide cooling at a lower cost. The cost of renewable energy continues to plummet, and many countries are increasing policy support and incentives.\n\nThere is much that humanity can do to limit future warming if countries, companies and people everywhere act with urgency. Rapidly reducing fossil fuel emissions can help avoid a warmer future with even worse heat waves and droughts, while also providing other benefits, including improving public health, creating jobs and reducing risks to ecosystems.\n\nThis is an update to an article originally published on June 26, 2024.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

And halfway to boiling.\"\n\n- 'Unfamiliar threats' -\n\nThe ILO report cautioned that \"countries previously unaccustomed to extreme heat will face unfamiliar threats which they may be ill-equipped to deal with, while conditions in regions already contending with sustained high temperatures will only deteriorate\".\n\nAt a global level, nearly 23 million occupational injuries attributed to excessive heat are reported each year, costing an estimated nearly 19,000 lives annually, the ILO said in a report published earlier this year.\n\n\"Heat is an invisible force - a silent killer,\" Tuesday's report cautioned.\n\nIt said heat hazards both for indoor and outdoor work increases the \"risk of health impacts such as heat exhaustion, heat stroke, cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, and death\".\n\nThe report highlighted the impact of heatwaves, which account for about 10 percent of overall excessive heat exposure globally, and which it said had cost 4,200 workers their lives in 2020.\n\nIn total, 231 million workers were exposed to heatwaves that year -- a 66-percent hike from 2000.\n\nEurope, Central Asia and the Americas saw the fastest increase in exposure to excessive heat on the job during heatwaves, with around 78.5 percent of such exposure happening during heatwaves, the ILO report said.\n\n\"Excessive heat is creating unprecedented challenges for workers worldwide year-round, and not only during periods of intense heatwaves,\" Vera Paquete-Perdigao, head of ILO's governance department which produced the report, said in a statement.\n\nManal Azzi, head of ILO's occupational safety and health division, called for \"year-round heat action plans and legislation to protect workers\" as well as \"stronger global collaboration\".\n\nAccording to the report, improved safety and health measures to prevent injuries from excessive heat in the workplace could save up to $361 billion globally in lost income and medical treatment expenses.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Labour Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hyperthermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Asia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/images/UrduPoint-English-22.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Extreme heat is having an extreme impact on people and planet. The world must rise to the challenge of rising temperatures.\"\n\nThe UN chief highlighted that while \"crippling heat is everywhere\", it does not affect everyone equally.\n\nThose most at risk include the urban poor, pregnant women, children, older persons, those with disabilities, the sick, and the displaced, who often live in substandard housing without access to cooling.\n\nAccording to UN estimates, heat-related deaths for people over 65 years of age increased by about 85 per cent over the past two decades, while 25 per cent of all children today are exposed to frequent heatwaves and by 2050, that could rise to almost 100 per cent.\n\n\"We must respond by massively increasing access to low-carbon cooling, expanding passive cooling - such as natural solutions and urban design and cleaning up cooling technologies while boosting their efficiency,\" Mr. Guterres said, calling for scaling up of finances to protect communities from \"climate chaos\".\n\nGuterres also underscored the need to step up protections for workers.\n\nOver 70 per cent of the global workforce, or 2.4 billion people, are at substantial risk of extreme heat, according to new report from the UN International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\nThe situation is particularly dire in the Africa and Arab regions, where more than 90 per cent and 80 per cent of workers are exposed, respectively. In Asia and the Pacific - the world's most populous region - that figure is three in four workers (75 per cent).\n\nIn addition, heat stress at work is projected to cost the global economy $2.4 trillion by 2030, up from $280 billion in the mid-1990s.\n\n\"We need measures to protect workers, grounded in human rights,\" Guterres stressed, \"and we must ensure that laws and regulations reflect the reality of extreme heat today - and are enforced.\"\n\nHe also underscored the need to strengthen resilience of economies and societies, citing impacts such as infrastructure damage, crop failures, and increased pressure on water supplies, health systems, and electricity grids.\n\nCities are particularly vulnerable, experiencing heating at twice the global average rate.\n\nTo address these challenges, Guterres called for comprehensive and tailored action plans based on scientific data are essential for countries, cities and sectors.\n\n\"We need a concerted effort to heatproof economies, critical sectors, and the built environment.\"\n\nThe UN chief reiterated that it is crucial to recognize the myriad symptoms beyond extreme heat, such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires and rising sea levels.\n\nThe core issue is the reliance on fossil fuels and climate inaction, he stated, stressing that governments, especially G20 nations, the private sector, cities and regions, must urgently adopt climate action plans to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nAlongside, countries must urgently phase-out fossil fuels and end new coal projects.\n\n\"They must act as though our future depends on it -

And halfway to boiling.\"\n\nAccording to the European Copernicus network, July 21, 22 and 23 were the three hottest days ever recorded worldwide, with July 22 holding the absolute record of 17.16 degrees Celsius (62.9 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nGuterres repeated his call for humanity to fight its \"addiction\" to fossil fuels.\n\n\"Today, our focus is on the impact of extreme heat. But let's not forget that there are many other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: ever-more fierce hurricanes. Floods. Droughts. Wildfires. Rising sea levels. And the list goes on,\" he said.\n\n\"To tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease. And the disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction,\" he stressed, calling in particular on G20 countries to take action.\n\nWhile 2023 was the hottest year on record, and 2024 could set a new record, temperatures well above 40C (104F) are increasingly common.\n\nIn the space of a year, the 50C threshold has even been exceeded in at least 10 places, from Death Valley in the United States (53.9C on July 7) to Agadir in Morocco, and also in China and India.\n\nThe intense heat, often less visible than other devastating impacts of climate change such as storms or floods, is nonetheless more deadly.\n\nThis \"silent killer\" is responsible for around 489,000 deaths per year between 2000 and 2019, compared with 16,000 deaths per year from cyclones, according to the UN's \"Call to Action\" document published on Thursday.\n\n- Workers exposed -\n\nExtremely high temperatures also have an economic impact, with the UN estimating economic losses from heat stress at work will reach $2.4 trillion in 2030.\n\nAccording to a report by the International Labor Organization published on Thursday, more than 70 percent of workers were exposed to excessive heat in 2020, 8.8 percent more than in 2000.\n\n\"The good news is that we can save lives and we can limit its impact,\" Guterres said Thursday.\n\nThe UN has called for the world community to first act to protect \"the most vulnerable\" -- including young children, the elderly and also humanity's poorest.\n\nIn this context, early warning systems should include extreme heat, warning populations of the arrival of heat waves and informing them of the precautions to take, the document says.\n\nThe call to action also recommends an \"increase (to) equitable access to and scale up (of) low-carbon cooling.\"\n\nThis would involve investing in passive cooling systems -- which include climate-sensitive urban design measures, reflective surfaces and natural cooling systems -- and the phase-out of climate-warming gases that are used in many cooling systems.\n\nabd/aha/des\n\nMore from this section\n\niMyFone VoxBox TTS Voice AI Launches Video Dubbing Feature\n\nOptimal Blue Launches New Generative AI Assistant

The world must rise to the challenge of rising temperatures.\"\n\nThe UN chief highlighted that while \"crippling heat is everywhere\", it does not affect everyone equally.\n\nThose most at risk include the urban poor, pregnant women, children, older persons, those with disabilities, the sick, and the displaced, who often live in substandard housing without access to cooling.\n\nAccording to UN estimates, heat-related deaths for people over 65 years of age increased by about 85 per cent over the past two decades, while 25 per cent of all children today are exposed to frequent heatwaves and by 2050, that could rise to almost 100 per cent.\n\n\"We must respond by massively increasing access to low-carbon cooling, expanding passive cooling - such as natural solutions and urban design and cleaning up cooling technologies while boosting their efficiency,\" Mr. Guterres said, calling for scaling up of finances to protect communities from \"climate chaos\".\n\nMr. Guterres also underscored the need to step up protections for workers.\n\nOver 70 per cent of the global workforce, or 2.4 billion people, are at substantial risk of extreme heat, according to new report from the UN International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\nThe situation is particularly dire in the Africa and Arab regions, where more than 90 per cent and 80 per cent of workers are exposed, respectively. In Asia and the Pacific - the world's most populous region - that figure is three in four workers (75 per cent).\n\nIn addition, heat stress at work is projected to cost the global economy $2.4 trillion by 2030, up from $280 billion in the mid-1990s.\n\n\"We need measures to protect workers, grounded in human rights,\" Mr. Guterres stressed, \"and we must ensure that laws and regulations reflect the reality of extreme heat today - and are enforced.\"\n\nHe also underscored the need to strengthen resilience of economies and societies, citing impacts such as infrastructure damage, crop failures, and increased pressure on water supplies, health systems, and electricity grids.\n\nCities are particularly vulnerable, experiencing heating at twice the global average rate.\n\nTo address these challenges, Mr. Guterres called for comprehensive and tailored action plans based on scientific data are essential for countries, cities and sectors.\n\n\"We need a concerted effort to heatproof economies, critical sectors, and the built environment.\"\n\nThe UN chief reiterated that it is crucial to recognize the myriad symptoms beyond extreme heat, such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires and rising sea levels.\n\nThe core issue is the reliance on fossil fuels and climate inaction, he stated, stressing that governments, especially G20 nations, the private sector, cities and regions, must urgently adopt climate action plans to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nAlongside, countries must urgently phase-out fossil fuels and end new coal projects.\n\n\"They must act as though our future depends on it - because it does.\"", "source": {"uri": "news.un.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "UN News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headquarters_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Headquarters of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sahel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_cooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passive cooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Labour Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arabs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea level rise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "G20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Built environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyperthermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Collections/Embargoed/27-07-2023-ILO-Philippines-construction.jpg/image770x420cropped.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

The second is that the health impacts of heatwaves become much more serious when events persist. The third is that the hottest-day records this year are a surprise.\"\n\nHe added that high temperatures usually occur during El Nino years -- a natural warming of the equatorial Pacific that triggers weather extremes across the globe -- but the last El Nino ended in April.\n\nMr Field said the high temperature \"underscores the seriousness of the climate crisis\".\n\n\"This has been... probably the shortest-lived record ever,\" Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo said on Wednesday after his agency calculated that Monday had beaten Sunday's mark. He predicted that mark would also quickly fall, adding: \"We are in uncharted territory.\"\n\nBefore July 3 2023, the hottest day measured by Copernicus was 16.8C on August 13 2016. In the last 13 months that mark has been beaten 59 times, according to Copernicus.\n\nHumanity is now \"operating in a world that is already much warmer than it was before\", Mr Buontempo said.\n\n\"Unfortunately people are going to die and those deaths are preventable,\" said Kristie Ebi, a public health and climate professor at the University of Washington.\n\n\"Heat is called the silent killer for a reason. People often don't know they're in trouble with heat until it's too late.\"\n\nIn past heatwaves, deaths did not start piling up until day two, Ms Ebi said.\n\n\"At some point, the accumulated heat internally becomes too much, then your cells and your organs start to warm up.\"\n\nLast year, the US had its most recorded heat deaths in more than 80 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centres for Disease Control and Prevention data.\n\nThe death certificates of more than 2,300 people mentioned excessive heat, which killed 874 people in Arizona, 450 in Texas, 226 in Nevada, 84 in Florida and 83 in Louisiana.\n\nEarlier this year, India witnessed prolonged heatwaves that resulted in the death of at least 100 people. Health experts say heat deaths are likely to be undercounted in India and potentially other countries.\n\nThe \"big driver\" of the current heat is greenhouse gas emissions, from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Mr Buontempo said. Those gases help trap heat, changing the energy balance between the heat coming in from the sun and that escaping Earth, meaning the planet retains more heat energy than before, he added.\n\nOther factors include the warming of the Pacific by El Nino, the sun reaching its peak cycle of activity, an undersea volcano explosion, and air with fewer heat-reflecting particles because of marine fuel pollution regulations, experts said.\n\nThe last 13 months have all set heat records. The world's oceans broke heat records for 15 months in a row and that water heat, along with an unusually warm Antarctica, are helping push temperatures to record levels, Mr Buontempo said.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised to see Thursday, Friday and Saturday also set new warmest day records,\" said climate scientist Andrew Weaver at the University of Victoria in Canada.", "source": {"uri":

Issues Global Call to Combat Extreme Heat: Urgent Action Needed | Business", "body": "U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged global leaders to address the extreme heat crisis exacerbated by climate change, after the world experienced its hottest day ever recorded. The U.N. emphasized the need for reducing fossil fuel emissions and safeguarding vulnerable populations, including workers, due to the heightened risks of heatwaves.\n\nU.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres called on Thursday for a global response to the urgent issue of extreme heat, which has been exacerbated by climate change. His statements came just days after the world registered its hottest day on record.\n\n\"Extreme heat is the new abnormal,\" Guterres said. \"The world must rise to the challenge of rising temperatures.\" He emphasized that climate change is causing heatwaves to become more frequent, intense, and longer-lasting worldwide.\n\nThis year alone, extreme heat has resulted in 1,300 hajj pilgrims dying, closed schools for 80 million children in Africa and Asia, and caused a rise in hospitalizations and deaths in the Sahel. According to the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, each month since June 2023 has been the planet's warmest on record for that particular month.\n\nThe U.N. urges governments not only to reduce fossil fuel emissions -- the primary driver of climate change -- but also to protect the most vulnerable populations such as the elderly, pregnant women, and children. Safeguarding workers is also crucial, as over 70 percent of the global workforce, about 2.4 billion people, are at high risk of extreme heat, according to a report by the International Labour Organization (ILO) published Thursday.\n\nIn Africa, 93 percent of the workforce is exposed to excessive heat, while 84 percent of the Arab States' workforce face similar conditions. Excessive heat has been linked to nearly 23 million workplace injuries globally, and approximately 19,000 deaths annually.\n\n\"We need measures to protect workers, grounded in human rights,\" Guterres stated. He also called for \"heatproofing\" economies, critical sectors such as healthcare, and the built environment.\n\nRapid urbanization and the urban heat island effect are causing cities to warm at twice the global average rate. By 2050, experts predict a 700 percent increase in the number of urban poor living in extreme heat conditions.\n\nThis marks the first time the U.N. has made a global call for action on extreme heat. \"We need a policy signal and this is it,\" said Kathy Baughman Mcleod, CEO of Climate Resilience for All, a nonprofit focused on extreme heat. She noted, \"It's recognition of how big it is and how urgent it is. It's also recognition that everybody doesn't feel in the same way and pay the same price for it.\"", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sahel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Built_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Built environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urban heat island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arab world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Urbanization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Labour Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/25_07_2024_16_32_07_0820692.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

In the last 13 months that mark has been beaten 59 times, according to Copernicus.\n\nHumanity is now \"operating in a world that is already much warmer than it was before\", Mr Buontempo said.\n\n\"Unfortunately people are going to die and those deaths are preventable,\" said Kristie Ebi, a public health and climate professor at the University of Washington.\n\n\"Heat is called the silent killer for a reason. People often don't know they're in trouble with heat until it's too late.\"\n\nIn past heatwaves, deaths did not start piling up until day two, Ms Ebi said.\n\n\"At some point, the accumulated heat internally becomes too much, then your cells and your organs start to warm up.\"\n\nLast year, the US had its most recorded heat deaths in more than 80 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centres for Disease Control and Prevention data.\n\nThe death certificates of more than 2,300 people mentioned excessive heat, which killed 874 people in Arizona, 450 in Texas, 226 in Nevada, 84 in Florida and 83 in Louisiana.\n\nEarlier this year, India witnessed prolonged heatwaves that resulted in the death of at least 100 people. Health experts say heat deaths are likely to be undercounted in India and potentially other countries.\n\nThe \"big driver\" of the current heat is greenhouse gas emissions, from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Mr Buontempo said. Those gases help trap heat, changing the energy balance between the heat coming in from the sun and that escaping Earth, meaning the planet retains more heat energy than before, he added.\n\nOther factors include the warming of the Pacific by El Nino, the sun reaching its peak cycle of activity, an undersea volcano explosion, and air with fewer heat-reflecting particles because of marine fuel pollution regulations, experts said.\n\nThe last 13 months have all set heat records. The world's oceans broke heat records for 15 months in a row and that water heat, along with an unusually warm Antarctica, are helping push temperatures to record levels, Mr Buontempo said.\n\n\"I

Secretary General Antonio Guterres called on Thursday for countries to address the urgency of the extreme heat epidemic, fueled by climate change - days after the world registered its hottest day on record.\n\n\"Extreme heat is the new abnormal,\" Guterres said. \"The world must rise to the challenge of rising temperatures,\" he said.\n\nClimate change is making heatwaves more frequent, more intense and longer lasting across the world.\n\nAlready this year, scorching conditions have killed 1,300 hajj pilgrims, closed schools for some 80 million children in Africa and Asia, and led to a spike in hospitalizations and deaths in the Sahel.\n\nEvery month since June 2023 has now ranked as the planet's warmest since records began in 1940, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, according the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nThe U.N. called on governments to not only tamp down fossil fuel emissions - the driver of climate change - but to bolster protections for the most vulnerable, including the elderly, pregnant women and children, and step up safeguards for workers.\n\nOver 70 percent of the global workforce - 2.4 billion people - are now at high risk of extreme heat, according to a report from the International Labour Organization (ILO) published Thursday.\n\nIn Africa, nearly 93 percent of the workforce is exposed to excessive heat, and 84 percent of the Arab States' workforce, the ILO report found.\n\nExcessive heat has been blamed for causing almost 23 million workplace injuries worldwide, and some 19,000 deaths annually.\n\n\"We need measures to protect workers, grounded in human rights,\" Guterres said.\n\nHe also called for governments to \"heatproof\" their economies, critical sectors such as healthcare, and the built environment.\n\nCities are warming at twice the worldwide average rate due to rapid urbanization and the urban heat island effect.\n\nBy 2050, some researchers estimate a 700 percent global increase in the number of urban poor living in extreme heat conditions.\n\nThis is the first time the U.N. has put out a global call for action on extreme heat.\n\n\"We need a policy signal and this is it,\" said Kathy Baughman Mcleod, CEO of Climate Resilience for All, a nonprofit focused on extreme heat.\n\n\"It's recognition of how big it is and how urgent it is.

The world must rise to the challenge of rising temperatures.\"\n\nProtect the most vulnerable\n\nThe UN chief highlighted that while \"crippling heat is everywhere\", it does not affect everyone equally.\n\nThose most at risk include the urban poor, pregnant women, children, older persons, those with disabilities, the sick, and the displaced, who often live in substandard housing without access to cooling.\n\nAccording to UN estimates, heat-related deaths for people over 65 years of age increased by about 85 per cent over the past two decades, while 25 per cent of all children today are exposed to frequent heatwaves and by 2050, that could rise to almost 100 per cent.\n\n\"We must respond by massively increasing access to low-carbon cooling, expanding passive cooling - such as natural solutions and urban design and cleaning up cooling technologies while boosting their efficiency,\" Mr. Guterres said, calling for scaling up of finances to protect communities from \"climate chaos\".\n\nProtect workers\n\nMr. Guterres also underscored the need to step up protections for workers.\n\nOver 70 per cent of the global workforce, or 2.4 billion people, are at substantial risk of extreme heat, according to new report from the UN International Labour Organization (ILO).\n\nThe situation is particularly dire in the Africa and Arab regions, where more than 90 per cent and 80 per cent of workers are exposed, respectively. In Asia and the Pacific - the world's most populous region - that figure is three in four workers (75 per cent).\n\nIn addition, heat stress at work is projected to cost the global economy $2.4 trillion by 2030, up from $280 billion in the mid-1990s.\n\n\"We need measures to protect workers, grounded in human rights,\" Mr. Guterres stressed, \"and we must ensure that laws and regulations reflect the reality of extreme heat today - and are enforced.\"\n\nBoost resilience\n\nHe also underscored the need to strengthen resilience of economies and societies, citing impacts such as infrastructure damage, crop failures, and increased pressure on water supplies, health systems, and electricity grids.\n\nCities are particularly vulnerable, experiencing heating at twice the global average rate.\n\nTo address these challenges, Mr. Guterres called for comprehensive and tailored action plans based on scientific data are essential for countries, cities and sectors.\n\n\"We need a concerted effort to heatproof economies, critical sectors, and the built environment.\"\n\nFight the disease\n\nThe UN chief reiterated that it is crucial to recognize the myriad symptoms beyond extreme heat, such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires and rising sea levels.\n\nThe core issue is the reliance on fossil fuels and climate inaction, he stated, stressing that governments, especially G20 nations, the private sector, cities and regions, must urgently adopt climate action plans to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nAlongside, countries must urgently phase-out fossil fuels and end new coal projects.\n\n\"They must act as though our future depends on it - because it does.\"\n\n/UN News Release.

(File)\n\nUnited Nations:\n\nHumanity is suffering from an \"extreme heat epidemic,\" UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Thursday, calling for action to limit the impacts of heat waves intensified by climate change.\n\n\"Billions of people are facing an extreme heat epidemic -- wilting under increasingly deadly heat waves, with temperatures topping 50 degrees Celsius around the world,\" he said. \"That's 122 degrees Fahrenheit. And halfway to boiling.\"\n\nAccording to the European Copernicus network, July 21, 22 and 23 were the three hottest days ever recorded worldwide, with July 22 holding the absolute record of 17.16 degrees Celsius (62.9 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nGuterres repeated his call for humanity to fight its \"addiction\" to fossil fuels.\n\n\"Today, our focus is on the impact of extreme heat. But let's not forget that there are many other devastating symptoms of the climate crisis: ever-more fierce hurricanes. Floods. Droughts. Wildfires. Rising sea levels. And the list goes on,\" he said.\n\n\"To tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease. And the disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction,\" he stressed, calling in particular on G20 countries to take action.\n\nWhile 2023 was the hottest year on record, and 2024 could set a new record, temperatures well above 40C (104F) are increasingly common.\n\nIn the space of a year, the 50C threshold has even been exceeded in at least 10 places, from Death Valley in the United States (53.9C on July 7) to Agadir in Morocco, and also in China and India.\n\nThe intense heat, often less visible than other devastating impacts of climate change such as storms or floods, is nonetheless more deadly.\n\nThis \"silent killer\" is responsible for around 489,000 deaths per year between 2000 and 2019, compared with 16,000 deaths per year from cyclones, according to the UN's \"Call to Action\" document published on Thursday.\n\nWorkers exposed\n\nExtremely high temperatures also have an economic impact, with the UN estimating economic losses from heat stress at work will reach $2.4 trillion in 2030.\n\nAccording to a report by the International Labor Organization published on Thursday, more than 70 percent of workers were exposed to excessive heat in 2020, 8.8 percent more than in 2000.\n\n\"The good news is that we can save lives and we can limit its impact,\" Guterres said Thursday.\n\nThe UN has called for the world community to first act to protect \"the most vulnerable\" -- including young children, the elderly and also humanity's poorest.\n\nIn this context, early warning systems should include extreme heat, warning populations of the arrival of heat waves and informing them of the precautions to take, the document says.\n\nThe call to action also recommends an \"increase (to) equitable access to and scale up (of) low-carbon cooling.\"\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThis would involve investing in passive cooling systems -- which include climate-sensitive urban design measures, reflective surfaces and natural cooling systems -- and the phase-out of climate-warming gases that are used in many cooling systems.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

It noted heat-related deaths in countries from Saudi Arabia to India in the past 100 days alone.\n\n\"Secretary-General is issuing a global call to action on extreme heat in four critical areas: Care for the vulnerable; protect workers; boost the resilience of our economies and societies using data and science, and limit temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C,\" the document said.\n\nThe UN declaration came a day after India's earth sciences ministry informed Parliament that extreme heat is not yet considered a natural disaster eligible for financial assistance, as the 15th Finance Commission did not find merit in expanding the scope. The ministry added that heat wave deaths are reducing due to better weather prediction.\n\nModelled estimates show approximately 489,000 heat-related deaths occurred annually between 2000 and 2019, with 45% in Asia and 36% in Europe, the UN said. Heat exposure resulted in potential income losses equivalent to $863 billion in 2022.\n\nInternational Labour Organization data warns that over 70% of the global workforce - 2.4 billion people - are now at high risk of extreme heat, resulting in 22.85 million injuries and 18,970 deaths annually among workers. Africa, the Arab states, and Asia-Pacific are most exposed.\n\n\"Workers in Africa, the Arab states, and Asia and the Asia-Pacific are most exposed to excessive heat. In these regions, 93 per cent, 84 per cent, and 75% of the workforce are affected, respectively As daily temperatures rise above 34\u00b0C, labour productivity begins to drop by 50%,\" the report said.\n\nAnd such spells are only likely to get worse as the planet warms. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projects peak heatwave temperatures will increase significantly faster than average temperatures. An extreme heat event that would have occurred once in 50 years is now nearly five times more likely, and projected to be 14 times more likely under 2\u00b0C warming.\n\nUNICEF found that by 2050, nearly 2.2 billion children will be exposed to high heatwave frequency, up from only 24% in 2020. Heat-related mortality for people over 65 increased by approximately 85% between 2000-2004 and 2018-2022.\n\nThe UN has recommended that countries adopt evidence-based policies, regulations and multi-dimensional risk assessments and community-driven actions to protect the most vulnerable; enhance social protection schemes to integrate specific measures that help address the risks of extreme heat; implement urgent measures to protect the health and lives of all workers in all sectors and in all regions of the world from the risk of extreme heat through a rights-based approach; urgently review the laws and regulations on occupational safety and health to integrate provisions for extreme heat; develop and implement comprehensive, risk-informed heat action plans (and cooling plans) in all countries and all sectors among others.\n\n\"Every fraction of a degree of warming matters. With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes, impacts and risks become larger.

The second is that the health impacts of heatwaves become much more serious when events persist. The third is that the hottest-day records this year are a surprise.\"\n\nHe added that high temperatures usually occur during El Nino years -- a natural warming of the equatorial Pacific that triggers weather extremes across the globe -- but the last El Nino ended in April.\n\n(Ben Birchall/PA)\n\nMr Field said the high temperature \"underscores the seriousness of the climate crisis\".\n\n\"This has been... probably the shortest-lived record ever,\" Copernicus director Carlo Buontempo said on Wednesday after his agency calculated that Monday had beaten Sunday's mark. He predicted that mark would also quickly fall, adding: \"We are in uncharted territory.\"\n\nBefore July 3 2023, the hottest day measured by Copernicus was 16.8C on August 13 2016. In the last 13 months that mark has been beaten 59 times, according to Copernicus.\n\nHumanity is now \"operating in a world that is already much warmer than it was before\", Mr Buontempo said.\n\n\"Unfortunately people are going to die and those deaths are preventable,\" said Kristie Ebi, a public health and climate professor at the University of Washington.\n\n\"Heat is called the silent killer for a reason. People often don't know they're in trouble with heat until it's too late.\"\n\nIn past heatwaves, deaths did not start piling up until day two, Ms Ebi said.\n\n\"At some point, the accumulated heat internally becomes too much, then your cells and your organs start to warm up.\"\n\nLast year, the US had its most recorded heat deaths in more than 80 years, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centres for Disease Control and Prevention data.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised to see Thursday, Friday and Saturday also set new warmest day records Climate scientist Andrew Weaver\n\nThe death certificates of more than 2,300 people mentioned excessive heat, which killed 874 people in Arizona, 450 in Texas, 226 in Nevada, 84 in Florida and 83 in Louisiana.\n\nEarlier this year, India witnessed prolonged heatwaves that resulted in the death of at least 100 people. Health experts say heat deaths are likely to be undercounted in India and potentially other countries.\n\nThe \"big driver\" of the current heat is greenhouse gas emissions, from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, Mr Buontempo said. Those gases help trap heat, changing the energy balance between the heat coming in from the sun and that escaping Earth, meaning the planet retains more heat energy than before, he added.\n\nOther factors include the warming of the Pacific by El Nino, the sun reaching its peak cycle of activity, an undersea volcano explosion, and air with fewer heat-reflecting particles because of marine fuel pollution regulations, experts said.\n\nThe last 13 months have all set heat records. The world's oceans broke heat records for 15 months in a row and that water heat, along with an unusually warm Antarctica, are helping push temperatures to record levels, Mr Buontempo said.\n\n\"I

The Call to action outlines the global need to care for the vulnerable, protect workers, boost resilience using data and science, and limit global average temperature increase to 1.5 \u00b0C.\n\nThe climate crisis is driving temperatures up to unbearable levels all over the world leading to heat-related deaths, heat-related illnesses and putting strain on health systems all over the world. Heat stress is the leading cause of weather-related deaths and estimates show that approximately 489 000 heat-related deaths occurred each year between 2000 and 2019.\n\n\"Extreme heat is the most visible effect of climate change, everyone is affected,\" said Dr Maria Neira, Director of the Department of Environment, Climate Change and Health at the World Health Organization. \"Those with existing health conditions will be made much worse with extreme heat and it impacts the health of everyone in sometimes surprising ways. Even mental health is affected by heat, making people confused, anxious or even violent.\"\n\nAcute and prolonged exposure to excess heat causes heat stress on the body and exacerbates underlying illnesses including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, mental health, asthma and kidney disease. It can increase the risk of accidents, adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, and heighten the transmission of some infectious diseases. In extreme heat conditions, untreated heat stress can lead to heat stroke, which can be a fatal medical emergency.\n\nThe good news is that heat-related illness and deaths are preventable. There are evidence based actions and tools which save lives and significantly limit the health impacts of extreme heat. We can protect the most vulnerable through public awareness of how to keep cool, heat-ready social protection and health systems, scale up heat-health warning systems to alert authorities and the public, and foster nature-based solutions in cities to reduce excess urban heat.\n\nAccording to estimates in a report produced by WHO, the global scale-up of heat health-warning systems for 57 countries alone has the potential to save almost 100 000 lives per year. The WHO co-sponsors the Global Heat Health Information Network bringing together UN agencies, governments, experts, and civil society partners to share knowledge and scale solutions for protecting communities from extreme heat worldwide.\n\n/Public Release.

REUTERS/Khalid Al-Mousily\n\nPeople everywhere are struggling with the fatal impacts of worsening extreme heat, which is also damaging economies, widening inequalities and undermining green development, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said on Thursday.\n\nCalling for global action to limit the devastating consequences, the head of the United Nations said \"billions of people are facing an extreme heat epidemic - wilting under increasingly deadly heatwaves\".\n\nExtreme-heat events have been getting more frequent, intense and longer-lasting in recent decades as a result of human-made climate change.\n\nGuterres' appeal comes as the record for the world's hottest day was set twice on consecutive days this week, according to Europe's Copernicus Climate Change Service. Monday beat Sunday, with the global average surface air temperature reaching 17.15 Celsius, as parts of the world sweltered through fierce heatwaves from the Mediterranean to Russia and Canada.\n\nGuterres said the UN had just received preliminary data indicating that Tuesday \"was in the same range\", which would make a third hottest straight day on record, if confirmed.\n\nIn a speech, he noted that heat - driven by \"fossil fuel-charged, human-induced climate change\" - is estimated to kill almost half a million people a year, about 30 times more than tropical cyclones.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres speaks during the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) in Dubai, December 1, 2023. COP28/Christophe Viseux/Handout via REUTERS\n\nThis year alone, extreme heat struck highly vulnerable communities across the Sahel region, killed at least 1,300 pilgrims in Mecca during Hajj and shut down schools across Asia and Africa affecting more than 80 million children.\n\n\"And we know it's going to get worse. Extreme heat is the new abnormal,\" Guterres added in his speech to journalists at UN headquarters in New York.\n\nThe Secretary-General's \"call for action\" brings together ten specialised UN agencies for the first time in an urgent and concerted push to strengthen international cooperation in addressing extreme heat.\n\nFocus on most vulnerable\n\nGuterres listed four areas where greater efforts could be made to keep people, societies and economies safer from the negative consequences of rising global temperatures.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of \"caring for the most vulnerable\" - with those at greatest risk including poor people in urban areas, pregnant women, people with disabilities, the elderly, children, those who are sick and people who are displaced from their homes.\n\nHouseholds living in poverty often live in substandard homes without access to cooling, he added, appealing for a boost in access to low-carbon cooling and expanded use of natural measures - which include planting trees for shade - and better urban design, alongside a ramp-up of heat warning systems.\n\nGraphic from Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change\n\nWorkers also need more protection, he said, as a new report from the International Labour Organization warned that over 70 percent of the global workforce - 2.4 billion people - are now at high risk of extreme heat, especially in Asia-Pacific, Africa and the Arab States.\n\nThe UN is calling on governments to urgently review laws and regulations on occupational safety and health to integrate provisions for extreme heat, including the right to refuse working in extreme hot weather.\n\nEnergy transition and adaptation\n\nA third area targeted by the UN for action is making economies and societies better able to withstand heat, through stronger infrastructure, more resilient crops, and efforts to ease the pressure on health systems and water supplies.\n\n\"Countries, cities, and sectors need comprehensive, tailored Heat Action Plans, based on the best science and data,\" Guterres said.\n\nLastly, the UN chief urged stepped-up action to \"fight the disease\", by phasing out fossil fuels \"fast and fairly\" including no new coal projects, with the aim of limiting global warming to 1.5C - a goal nearly 200 governments signed up to in the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\n\"I must call out the flood of fossil fuel expansion we are seeing in some of the world's wealthiest countries,\" he emphasised. \"In signing such a surge of new oil and gas licenses, they are signing away our future.\"\n\nThe United States, Canada, Australia, Norway and the UK have issued two-thirds of the global number of oil and gas licences since 2020, according to research published by the International Institute for Sustainable Development this week.\n\n'Still time to act'\n\nCommenting on the UN's call to action, Alan Dangour, director of climate and health at Wellcome, a UK-based science foundation, noted that people working outside in physical jobs and those who cannot afford to adapt to rising heat are particularly exposed - but the effects are far broader.\n\n\"The levels of heat we now routinely see around the world put every part of society under extreme pressure, directly harming our health while also affecting food and water security and much of our vital infrastructures,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on Thursday, scientists convened by Wellcome said there are positive measures that can be taken to combat the problem of extreme heat, which can also bring wider social benefits.\n\nUAE's ALT\u00c9RRA invests in fund backing fossil gas despite \"climate solutions\" pledge\n\nFor example, they explained that using community facilities as cooling centres can offer older people a place to chat or play cards, tackling social isolation and heat stress at the same time. Or adding shades with solar panels to market stalls can help women traders keep working on hot days while also providing free electricity for their businesses.\n\n\"There is still time for concerted action to save lives from the impacts of climate change, but we can no longer afford to delay,\" Dangour said.\n\nThe UN's call for action points out that existing tools to reduce the devastating consequences of extreme heat could be deployed with large and far-reaching effects. Guterres said the good news is that \"there are solutions... that we can save lives and limit its impact\".\n\nFor example, a global scale-up of heat health warning systems could save more than 98,000 lives every year, according to the World Health Organization. And the rollout of occupational safety and health measures could avoid $361 billion a year in medical and other costs, the ILO has estimated.\n\nThe UN chief urged a \"huge acceleration of all the dimensions of climate action\" as global warming is currently outpacing efforts to fight it. That could start to change, he added, as heatwaves, impacts on public health and disasters such as Canada's wildfires are now hitting the richest countries as well as poorer ones.\n\n\"The heat is being felt by those that have decision-making capacity - and that is my hope,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting and editing by Matteo Civillini and Megan Rowling)", "source": {"uri": "climatechangenews.com",

in Morocco, and also in China and India.\n\nThe intense heat, often less visible than other devastating impacts of climate change such as storms or floods, is nonetheless more deadly.\n\nThis \"silent killer\" is responsible for around 489,000 deaths per year between 2000 and 2019, compared with 16,000 deaths per year from cyclones, according to the UN's \"Call to Action\" document published on Thursday.\n\nExtremely high temperatures also have an economic impact, with the UN estimating economic losses from heat stress at work will reach $2.4 trillion in 2030.\n\nAccording to a report by the International Labor Organization published on Thursday, more than 70 percent of workers were exposed to excessive heat in 2020, 8.8 percent more than in 2000.\n\n\"The good news is that we can save lives and we can limit its impact,\" Guterres said Thursday.\n\nThe UN has called for the world community to first act to protect \"the most vulnerable\" -- including young children, the elderly and also humanity's poorest.\n\nIn this context, early warning systems should include extreme heat, warning populations of the arrival of heat waves and informing them of the precautions to take, the document says.\n\nThe call to action also recommends an \"increase (to) equitable access to and scale up (of) low-carbon cooling.\"\n\nThis would involve investing in passive cooling systems -- which include climate-sensitive urban design measures, reflective surfaces and natural cooling systems -- and the phase-out of climate-warming gases that are used in many cooling systems.", "source":

Pregnant women. People with disabilities. Older people. The very young, the sick, the displaced, and the impoverished - who often live in substandard housing without access to cooling.\"\n\nHe said extreme heat amplified inequality, worsened food insecurity and pushed people further into poverty.\n\nHe called for action to increase \"massively\" access to low-carbon cooling, expanding passive cooling such as natural solutions and urban design and cleaning up cooling technologies while boosting efficiency.\n\nThere should be a scaling-up of heat health warning systems, and developed countries should honour their promises and deliver finance to help poor nations and communities adapt to climate change.\n\nHe said 2.4 billion people in the global workforce were now at high risk of extreme heat, harming health and productivity with heat stress at work predicted to cost the global economy 2.4 trillion US dollars (\u00a31.86 trillion) by 2030.\n\n\"We need measures to protect workers, grounded in human rights,\" he said.\n\n\"And we must ensure that laws and regulations reflect the reality of extreme heat today - and are enforced.\"\n\nHe also called for measures to boost the resilience of economies and societies, as infrastructure buckles, crops fail, and pressure is piled on water supplies, power grids and health systems by extreme heat.\n\nCities are a particular worry, he warned, as they are heating at twice the global average, and he called for countries, cities and sectors to have comprehensive tailored heat action plans based on the best science and data.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType":

It remained in a similar range on Tuesday.\n\nUN secretary-general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the weather extremes being experienced were symptoms of the \"disease\" of the \"addiction to fossil fuels\". Burning of these fuels for heat and energy is the biggest contributor to global warming.\n\nThe International Labour Organization, a UN agency, said the fastest changing working conditions were in Europe and central Asia, where almost a third of the workforce was exposed to extreme heat.\n\nThe regions had greatest increase in the number of workers enduring excessive heat exposure, at 17.3 per cent between 2000 and 2020, or almost double the global average rise of 8.8 per cent. Europe is the world's fastest warming continent.\n\nThis was matched by a rapid increase in the proportion of heat-related occupational injuries since 2000 to 2020, with a 16.4 per cent rise.\n\nThe proportion of heat related occupational injuries also spiked in the Americas, up 33 per cent over the same period.\n\nBy far the greatest proportion of the workforce enduring excessive heat, remained in Africa, the Arab states and Asia and the Pacific, however, where respectively some 93 per cent, 84 per cent and 75 per cent are affected, with a prevalence of outdoor physical, construction, agricultural or industrial work.\n\nThe ILO estimated that improved safety and health measures to prevent injuries from excessive heat in the workplace could save up to $361bn globally, including lost income and medical treatment expenses.\n\nOverall, it said some 2.4bn workers -- about 70 per cent of the global workforce -- were now at high risk of extreme heat.\n\nThe ILO cited a study finding that if the core body temperature rises above 38C, physical and cognitive functions are impaired, and above 40.6C, the risk of organ damage, loss of consciousness and fatality, increases sharply.\n\n\"There is only so much heat that our bodies can endure,\" said Alan Dangour, director of climate and health at Wellcome.\n\nThe UN's Guterres called for workplace laws and regulations to integrate extreme heat risks, as well as the appointment of heat champions to drive government responses to extreme heat.\n\nGovernments needed to \"turbo charge measures to phase out fossil fuels\", he said, including cutting global production and consumption of all fossil fuels at least 30 per cent by 2030.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"},

The new data reveals that regions previously unaccustomed to extreme heat will face increased risks, while workers in already hot climates will confront ever more dangerous conditions.\n\nHeat stress is an invisible and silent killer that can quickly cause illness, heatstroke or even death. Over time it can also lead to serious heart, lung and kidney problems for workers, the study underlines.\n\nOverall, the report indicates that workers in Africa, the Arab states and Asia and the Pacific are most often exposed to excessive heat. In these regions, 92.9 per cent, 83.6 per cent and 74.7 per cent of the workforce are affected, respectively. The figures are above the global average of 71 per cent, according to the most recent figures available (2020).\n\nThe fastest changing working conditions are seen in Europe and Central Asia, says the report. From 2000 to 2020 the region recorded the largest increase in excessive heat exposure, with the proportion of workers affected rising by 17.3 per cent, almost double the global average increase.\n\nMeanwhile, the Americas and Europe and Central Asia are witnessing the largest rise in workplace injuries from heat stress since the year 2000, with increases of 33.3 per cent and 16.4 per cent respectively. This is possibly due to hotter temperatures in regions where workers are unaccustomed to heat, the report notes.\n\nThe report estimates that 4,200 workers globally lost their lives to heatwaves in 2020. In total, 231 million workers were exposed to heatwaves in 2020, marking a 66 per increase from 2000. Nonetheless, the report stresses that nine out of ten workers globally were exposed to excessive heat outside of a heatwave and eight in ten occupational injuries from extreme heat happened outside of heatwaves.\n\nExcessive heat is creating unprecedented challenges for workers worldwide year-round, and not only during periods of intense heatwaves.\n\n\"As the world continues to grapple with rising temperatures, we must protect workers from heat stress year-round. Excessive heat is creating unprecedented challenges for workers worldwide year-round, and not only during periods of intense heatwaves, said ILO Director-General Gilbert F. Houngbo.\n\nImproved safety and health measures to prevent injuries from excessive heat in the workplace could save up to US$361 billion globally - in lost income and medical treatment expenses - as the heat stress crisis accelerates, affecting global regions differently, emphasizes the study.\n\nThe ILO estimates show that low- and middle-income economies, in particular, are the most affected, as the costs of injuries from excessive heat in the workplace can reach around 1.5 per cent of national GDP.\n\n\"This is a human rights issues, a workers' rights issue, and an economic issue, and middle-income economies are bearing the biggest brunt. We need year-round heat action plans and legislation to protect workers, and stronger global collaboration among experts to harmonize heat stress assessments and interventions at work,\" added Houngbo.\n\nThe impact of heat on workers worldwide is fast becoming a global issue, and one that requires action.\n\n\"If there is one thing that unites our divided world, it's that we're all increasingly feeling the heat. Earth is becoming hotter and more dangerous for everyone, everywhere. We must rise to the challenge of rising temperatures - and step up protections for workers, grounded in human rights,\" explained the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres.\n\nThe ILO report looks at legislative measures in 21 countries worldwide to find common features that can guide the creation of effective workplace heat safety plans. It also describes the key concepts of a safety and health management system to protect workers from heat-related illnesses and injuries.\n\nThe findings build on a previous report, published in April this year, which indicated that climate change was creating a \"cocktail\" of serious health hazards for an estimated 2.4 billion workers who are exposed to excessive heat. The April report indicated that excessive heat alone causes 22.85 million occupational injuries and the loss of 18,970 lives each year.\n\nReport findings per region:\n\nAfrica\n\nWorkplace exposures to excessive heat in Africa were above the global average, affecting 92.9 per cent of the workforce.The Africa region has the greatest proportion of occupational injuries As put by excessive heat, accounting for 7.2 per cent of all occupational injuries.\n\nAmericas\n\nThe Americas region has seen the most rapidly increasing proportion of heat-related occupational injuries since the year 2000, with an increase of 33.3 per cent.The Americas also have a significant proportion of occupational injuries due to excessive heat, at 6.7 per cent.\n\nArab States\n\nWorkplace exposures to excessive heat in the Arab States were above the global average, affecting 83.6 per cent of the workforce.\n\nAsia and the Pacific\n\nWorkplace exposures to excessive heat in Asia and the Pacific were above the global average, affecting 74.7 per cent of the workforce.\n\nEurope and Central Asia\n\nEurope and Central Asia had the greatest increase in excessive heat exposure, with a 17.3 per cent increase between 2000 and 2020. This is almost double the global average increase of 8.8 per cent.The region has seen a rapid increase in the proportion of heat-related occupational injuries since 2000, with a 16.4 per cent increase. /Public Release.

That is 122 degrees Fahrenheit - halfway to boiling,\" the UN chief said at a press conference at UN Headquarters in New York.\n\n\"The message is clear: the heat is on. Extreme heat is having an extreme impact on people and planet. The world must rise to the challenge of rising temperatures.\"\n\nThe UN chief highlighted that while \"crippling heat is everywhere\", it does not affect everyone equally.\n\nThose most at risk include the urban poor, pregnant women, children, older persons, those with disabilities, the sick, and the displaced, who often live in substandard housing without access to cooling.\n\nAccording to UN estimates, heat-related deaths for people over 65 years of age increased by about 85 per cent over the past two decades, while 25 per cent of all children today are exposed to frequent heatwaves and by 2050, that could rise to almost 100 per cent.\n\n\"We must respond by massively increasing access to low-carbon cooling, expanding passive cooling - such as natural solutions and urban design and cleaning up cooling technologies while boosting their efficiency,\" Mr. Guterres said, calling for scaling up of finances to protect communities from \"climate chaos\".\n\nGuterres also underscored the need to step up protections for workers.\n\n\"We need measures to protect workers, grounded in human rights,\" Guterres stressed, \"and we must ensure that laws and regulations reflect the reality of extreme heat today - and are enforced.\"\n\nHe also underscored the need to strengthen resilience of economies and societies, citing impacts such as infrastructure damage, crop failures, and increased pressure on water supplies, health systems, and electricity grids.\n\nCities are particularly vulnerable, experiencing heating at twice the global average rate.\n\nTo address these challenges, Guterres called for comprehensive and tailored action plans based on scientific data are essential for countries, cities and sectors.\n\n\"We need a concerted effort to heatproof economies, critical sectors, and the built environment.\"\n\nThe UN chief reiterated that it is crucial to recognize the myriad symptoms beyond extreme heat, such as hurricanes, floods, droughts, wildfires and rising sea levels.\n\nThe core issue is the reliance on fossil fuels and climate inaction, he stated, stressing that governments, especially G20 nations, the private sector, cities and regions, must urgently adopt climate action plans to limit global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nAlongside, countries must urgently phase-out fossil fuels and end new coal projects.\n\n\"They must act as though our future depends on it -

Three days after the Earth recorded its hottest day ever on Monday, at a global average surface temperature of 17.15 degrees Celsius, he reminded 196 countries of their Paris climate agreement pledges.\n\nThe current plans add up to about 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming above the pre-industrial average by 2100. That's well above the Paris Agreement's goal of capping warming as close to 1.5 degrees as possible and into the realm of extremely dangerous heating, with nearly unsurvivable heatwaves, crop failures and more severe floods and droughts.\n\nThose are the symptoms of the climate crisis, and \"to tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease,\" he said. \"The disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction.\"\n\nIn particular, he said developed countries must lead the way in cutting fossil fuel emissions and shifting funding away from oil and gas and toward renewables. But instead, many are doing the opposite, including the United States which has increased fossil fuel production to the highest level ever.\n\n\"I must call out the flood of fossil fuel expansion we are seeing in some of the world's wealthiest countries,\" Guterres said. \"In signing such a surge of new oil and gas licenses, they are signing away our future.\"\n\nThe warnings were reinforced by a new report on heat impacts, showing a global average of 489,000 annual heat-related deaths between 2000 and 2019, with 45 percent of the deaths in Asia and 36 percent in Europe.\n\nThe report, United Nations Secretary-General's Call to Action on Extreme Heat, was compiled by 10 specialized U.N. entities, including those focused on agriculture, health, biodiversity, cultural heritage, disaster risk reduction and meteorology showing heat impacts to every aspect of life all over the world.\n\nGlobally, 2.41 billion workers, 70 percent of the working population, are exposed to excessive heat, the report found. Poor people, older people and people with pre-existing health conditions, as well as pregnant women, infants and young children, are especially vulnerable to heat, and more must be done to protect them given the near-certainty of worsening heatwaves in the years ahead, the report noted, citing the IPCC.\n\nThe report emphasizes focusing on four areas: Caring for the vulnerable; protecting workers; boosting the resilience of economies and societies using data and science: and limiting the average global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nAlso worrying is that the world's cities are heating up at twice the global average rate, with rapid urbanization leading to more concentration of heat in urban areas, where more than half the world's population lives.\n\n\"As the world is heating up faster than anticipated, cities are bearing the brunt, as congestion, the built environment and concentrated energy use trap and amplify temperatures,\" the U.N. authors wrote.\n\n\"This is exactly what climate science told us would happen if the world continued burning coal, oil and gas,\" said Joyce Kimutai, a climate scientist at Imperial College, London, adding that it will keep getting hotter until the world stops burning fossil fuels. \"People are suffering as the world heats up,\" she said. \"The suffering will only become greater as long as emissions continue.\"\n\nIt's not just the heat, said Akshay Deoras, a research scientist with the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading. Human-caused warming is also intensifying extremes of the water cycle, with more floods and more droughts.\n\nThe report was released just two days after scientists reported that Earth as a whole had experienced its warmest day on record, with the average surface temperature at just over 17 degrees Celsius. The last 13 consecutive months have all set records and the planet also just experienced its first stretch of 12 consecutive months exceeding the 1.5 degrees of warming that the Paris climate agreement set as a temperature limit.\n\n\"At present, warmer than normal weather conditions are being witnessed across all continents of our planet,\" Deoras said. \"So, the warming pattern responsible for the record temperature on July 21 seems to be more or less uniform across the planet.\"\n\n\"We know what is driving it,\" Guterres said. \"Fossil fuel-charged, human-induced climate change.\"\n\nHe listed some of the most recent horrific impacts of extreme heat, including a reported 1,300 deaths during the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, in a region where temperatures have been climbing to 40, and even topping 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit).\n\nIn the United States, he said, warmth was so widespread and oppressive that 120 million people were under heat warnings, while heat-related school closures in Africa and Asia affected more than 80 million children.\n\nHeat stress at work is projected to cost the global economy $2.4 trillion by 2030, up from $280 billion in the mid-1990s. He said that as daily temperatures rise above 34 degrees Celsius, labor productivity drops by 50 percent.\n\nHe said the next round of national climate action plans, which are due in 2025 under the Paris Agreement, must show how developed countries will cut global consumption and production of fossil fuels by thirty percent by 2030.\n\n\"We need similar 1.5-aligned transition plans from business, the financial sector, cities and regions,\" he added.\n\nDeveloped countries, specifically the G20, are facing a \"dangerous reality,\" said Paris Agreement co-architect Christiana Figueres, who oversaw U.N. climate negotiations from 2010 to 2016, and the co-founder of Global Optimism, a U.K.-based civic organization promoting a culture of optimism and collaboration to tackle the climate crisis.\n\nRich countries with strong economies must address the climate crisis decisively, with policies to accelerate the deployment of renewables and prudently phaseout fossil fuels.\n\n\"One third of global electricity can be produced by solar and wind alone,\" she said. \"But targeted national policies have to enable that transformation. Or we all scorch and fry.\"", "source": {"uri": "insideclimatenews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "InsideClimate News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derek_harrison@insideclimatenews.org", "name": "Derek

It's a growing concern as summers get hotter. In Boston, average summertime temperatures have increased 1.4 degrees since 1970. Global warming also has upped the intensity and duration of extreme heat events, and heat waves now occur more frequently across the U.S.\n\n\"Many people -- employers and workers -- don't know the dangers of workplace heat. It just doesn't viscerally resonate as dangerous the way that frigid weather does, for example,\" Terri Gerstein, director of the NYU Wagner Labor Initiative, told city councilors. \"People sometimes feel like, 'well, you know, it's the summer. It's hot. Get used to it.' But it's hotter than it used to be and it is extremely dangerous.\"\n\n\"Heat is the most deadly natural hazard. The data is showing more so than tornadoes, hurricanes, all of that. And it particularly is a hazard at work.\"\n\nThe city's climate projections show Boston could get up to 60 days over 90 degrees in the next 50 years, according to Zoe Davis, a climate resilience project manager in Boston's Environment Department.\n\n\"We could see about 130 days over 80 degrees Fahrenheit in the next 50 years as well,\" Davis said.\n\nHeat doesn't just affect outdoor workers like those in construction or landscaping. People who work indoors in places without air conditioning, like warehouses or kitchens, can also be impacted.\n\nNearly 1,000 workers died from heat exposure in the U.S. between 1992 and 2022, according to Jodi Sugerman-Brozan, the city's deputy chief of worker empowerment.\n\n\"Heat is the most deadly natural hazard,\" Sugerman-Brozan said. \"The data is showing more so than tornadoes, hurricanes, all of that. And it particularly is a hazard at work.\"\n\nBoston currently has no protections for employees forced to work during heat emergencies. The city does, however, have a heat resilience plan. There are also no federal or state standards for protecting workers in extreme heat, though some efforts are underway.\n\nThe Biden administration proposed a new rule that would require employers to address heat-related illness and hazards in the workplace. The rule, however, faces an uphill battle to get finalized in an election year.\n\n\"A federal heat standard would more clearly establish enforceable employee obligations and measures necessary to effectively protect employees from hazardous heat,\" said Amee Bhatt, assistant regional administrator for enforcement programs at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) Boston office.\n\nBhatt said OSHA has issued guidance on heat safety to employers and done outreach in recent years.\n\nThe state has also issued guidance to employers. A working group with the state's Department of Labor Standards has focused on heat and worker safety for two years. The group has developed best practices for employers and is piloting a heat illness prevention program with a few municipalities.\n\nCouncilor Weber said it's important for the city to step in with its own rules to ensure workers receive adequate water, shade, breaks and other provisions in extreme heat conditions. He plans to file a city ordinance this fall to make sure employers have safety plans in place to prevent heat illness in the workplace.\n\n\"I want to put employers on notice that when conditions are extremely hot -- as will be defined in the ordinance -- that we provide water, rest, and shade for those workers,\" Weber said.\n\nFrank Murray, president of Iron Workers Local 7, said the city should look to unions when crafting its heat safety protocols since the building trades already have practices in place as well as provisions like drinking water and shelter in their bargaining agreements.\n\n\"In my experience as a union member, it's always been promoted -- your personal safety, your personal hydration ... like how you're feeling and your physical body,\" Murray said.\n\nRick Rabin of the workers' rights nonprofit Massachusetts Coalition for Occupational Safety and Health (MassCOSH) said it's important the city puts clear rules in place for working in heat.\n\n\"Far too many of the workers that we see don't know that they have these rights,\" said Rabin, a trainer and technical consultant at MassCOSH. \"And if they know that they have the rights, they're afraid of retaliation, either being fired or being deported. So, having it in writing and having it enforced is absolutely crucial.\"", "source": {"uri": "wbur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WBUR 90.9 mHz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_hazard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural hazard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Weber", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Weber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labor rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rash", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Wagner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Occupational Safety and Health Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscaping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landscaping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24172654738453-1000x667.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

And we know it's going to get worse; extreme heat is the new abnormal.\"\n\nGuterres's warning comes a day after the European Union's climate monitor said the world had experienced its hottest day on record this week.\n\nThe Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said on Wednesday that the global average surface air temperature on July 22 rose to 17.15 degrees Celsius (62.9 degrees Fahrenheit) - or 0.06 degrees Celsius higher than the record set just a day earlier.\n\nEvery month since June 2023 has now ranked as the planet's warmest since records began in 1940, compared with the corresponding month in previous years, according to C3S.\n\n\"This is exactly what climate science told us would happen if the world continued burning coal, oil and gas,\" Joyce Kimutai, a climate scientist from Imperial College London, told the AFP news agency about this week's findings.\n\n\"And it will continue getting hotter until we stop burning fossil fuels and reach net zero emissions.\"\n\nThe record had last been set for four consecutive days in early July 2023. Before that, the hottest day was in August 2016.\n\nMillions of people around the world have experienced record-high temperatures in recent weeks, including across the Middle East, Africa and Asia, where the crisis has exacerbated social inequalities.\n\nMore than 70 percent of the global workforce - some 2.4 billion people - are now at high risk of extreme heat, according to a report from the International Labour Organization (ILO) published on Thursday.\n\nIn Africa, nearly 93 percent of the workforce is exposed to excessive heat, and 84 percent of the Arab states' workforces, the report found.\n\nExcessive heat has been blamed for causing almost 23 million workplace injuries worldwide, and some 19,000 deaths annually.\n\nExperts also have warned that as the effects of climate change intensify, weather patterns are becoming more extreme with droughts, super-charged hurricanes, floods and wildfires affecting much of the globe.\n\nDuring Thursday's news conference, Guterres said countries must reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, which worsens the climate crisis.\n\n\"Leaders across the board must wake up and step up - and that means governments, especially G20 countries,\" the UN chief said.\n\n\"The leadership of those with the greatest capabilities and capacities is essential.

Heat stress, which occurs when the body cannot cool itself adequately, can lead to serious health issues such as heat exhaustion, heatstroke, and other heat-related illnesses. This is particularly dangerous for workers in physically demanding environments who are often exposed to high temperatures and strenuous activities.\n\nIn this extra-large combo issue of ISHN, we're offering a summer safety guide to provide a variety of information, tips, guidelines and strategy to help you learn more about reducing injuries this season. I hope you find the content valuable.\n\nIn June, the U.S. Department of Labor released a much-anticipated proposed heat rule with the goal of protecting millions of workers from the significant health risks of extreme heat. If finalized, the proposed rule would help protect approximately 36 million workers in indoor and outdoor work settings and substantially reduce heat injuries, illnesses and deaths in the workplace.\n\nThe proposed rule would require employers to develop an injury and illness prevention plan to control heat hazards in workplaces affected by excessive heat. Among other things, the plan would require employers to evaluate heat risks and -- when heat increases risks to workers -- implement requirements for drinking water, rest breaks and control of indoor heat. It would also require a plan to protect new or returning workers unaccustomed to working in high heat conditions.\n\n\"Workers all over the country are passing out, suffering heat stroke and dying from heat exposure from just doing their jobs, and something must be done to protect them,\" said Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Doug Parker. (The) \"proposal is an important next step in the process to receive public input to craft a 'win-win' final rule that protects workers while being practical and workable for employers.\"\n\nEmployers would also be required to provide training, have procedures to respond if a worker is experiencing signs and symptoms of a heat-related illness, and take immediate action to help a worker experiencing signs and symptoms of a heat emergency.\n\nLast month, we asked website readers to answer the following question: As an industrial safety professional, which aspect of your job do you find most challenging? We received a variety of responses, but the majority of pros (54 percent) said balancing safety priorities with operational demands and budget constraints is the most challenging.

Pregnant women. People with disabilities. Older people. The very young, the sick, the displaced, and the impoverished - who often live in substandard housing without access to cooling.\"\n\nHe said extreme heat amplified inequality, worsened food insecurity and pushed people further into poverty.\n\nHe called for action to increase \"massively\" access to low-carbon cooling, expanding passive cooling such as natural solutions and urban design and cleaning up cooling technologies while boosting efficiency.\n\nThere should be a scaling-up of heat health warning systems, and developed countries should honour their promises and deliver finance to help poor nations and communities adapt to climate change.\n\nHe said 2.4 billion people in the global workforce were now at high risk of extreme heat, harming health and productivity with heat stress at work predicted to cost the global economy 2.4 trillion US dollars (\u00a31.86 trillion) by 2030.\n\n\"We need measures to protect workers, grounded in human rights,\" he said.\n\n\"And we must ensure that laws and regulations reflect the reality of extreme heat today - and are enforced.\"\n\nHe also called for measures to boost the resilience of economies and societies, as infrastructure buckles, crops fail, and pressure is piled on water supplies, power grids and health systems by extreme heat.\n\nCities are a particular worry, he warned, as they are heating at twice the global average, and he called for countries, cities and sectors to have comprehensive tailored heat action plans based on the best science and data.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus_Climate_Change_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copernicus Climate Change Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sahel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hajj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Institute_for_Sustainable_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Institute for Sustainable Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon_exploration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrocarbon exploration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incineration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incineration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(element)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercury (element)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_cooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passive cooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyperthermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.guernseypress.com/resizer/v2/Z4GCXZDT3VGXXACN734B3YXUTU.jpg?auth=1462e3a4e03a803bf34fbc87932f907fb4f035198f086df5ef2e6030f821fb73&width=1200&height=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 651, "textEnd": 658}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

Or follow us on Google News!\n\nExtreme heat has been ravaging North America, Europe, and Asia this summer. We're collecting records, yet again, and the worst thing is that we know this is only the beginning ... summer heat of today will look like a comfortable, cool breeze in a couple of decades. But, yes, let's not even go there, because this summer has been bad enough (and it's not even halfway over).\n\nAlready back in May, Reuters reported, \"Meteorologists say a weather phenomenon known as a 'heat dome' has trapped hot air over the southern Gulf of Mexico and northern Central America, causing temperatures to soar to 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas. Between May 12 and May 21, authorities said 22 people died from heat-related causes, adding to a total of 48 deaths since March 17. In comparison, during the same period in 2022 and 2023, heat waves claimed the lives of two and three people, respectively.\"\n\nOf course, extreme heat leads to other uncommon or unprecedented extreme weather events, as evidenced here:\n\nMeanwhile, over in Delhi, India, the capital city of famously hot India set a new heat record in May, before summer officially arrived, reaching 52.3 degrees Celsius (Fahrentheit)! \"The highest temperature ever recorded in India has been recorded. According to the national Indian meteorological authority IMD, 52.3 degrees Celsius were recorded on Wednesday afternoon in Mungeshpur, a suburb in the Indian capital region of Delhi, which has been hit by a heat wave. The previous record for India was 51 degrees: it was measured in 2016 in the desert region of Phalodi in the state of Rajasthan,\" TA International writes.\n\n\"According to preliminary data from the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, the global average temperature reached 17.15 degrees Celsius (62.87 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday, toppling the prior day's record of 17.09 C.\" So, not only was it a new record, it was a pretty sharp rise over the previous record.\n\nAs I was going to get the graph for this, though, I noticed something else. Tuesday's data is now in, and Tuesday was even hotter than Monday! So, for the third day in a row, it was the hottest day on record.\n\nAlso, while those rises in record temperature may not seem like a lot on the surface, remember that these represent global averages. The more extreme cases in various locations will be much more ... extreme. Also, one metereologist explained it well with a good old-fashioned metaphor: \"Let's say your body temperature went up half a degree, that wouldn't worry you if you're 98.6 F, but if you're already 103 F, that extra half a degree is really unsettling,\" meteorologist Bob Henson said.\n\nTemperatures in Fairbanks, Alaska, were forecast to hit 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) yesterday. Earlier in July, Las Vegas \"saw five straight days with a high temperature of 115 degrees Fahrenheit or more, breaking the old record of four consecutive days set in July 2005, per The Guardian. It also hit a record high of 120 degrees on July 7.\"\n\nAnd if you think heat is something we can handle with air conditioning and water, note that heat kills more people in the US than every other disaster you can think up. \"The National Weather Service reports that heat has been the leading cause of weather-related deaths in our country for at least 30 years. On average, heat has killed more people during the past three decades than floods, lightning, and hurricanes combined,\" TCD writes.\n\nJune was the 13th month in a row to set a new heat record for the month. We can be sure July will be the 14th month in a row.\n\nI don't know what stories we're going to see in coming days about record human deaths, dying animals, and extreme weather events from this record heat wave. But we can be sure they're coming.\n\nThe planet, our home, is getting cooked. And we're clearly not doing enough to stop it.\n\nGlobal heating is here.

We've been making some big improvements with our e-Edition. Click here to learn more.\n\nWhile last summer was characterized by relentless rain, this summer is staking its claim as one of the hottest summers yet for us New Hampshirites. Heat waves have been abundant, the temperature consistently remains above yearly averages and my AC unit can barely keep up.\n\nSo, when most of us are accustomed to moderate summertime temperatures, heat waves can hit us hard, and with average temperatures increasing, knowledge (and air conditioning) is the only way to keep ourselves safe and healthy while still getting the most out of our limited summer months.\n\nIn New England, when there's a limited window to take advantage of the summer weather, it's easier to ignore heat warnings, but it's important to understand what they mean and how we can still enjoy the warm weather in a changing climate.\n\nWhat is the Heat Index?\n\n\"It's not the heat, it's the humidity\" -- well, it's really both.\n\nThe heat index -- more commonly named the \"real feel\" or \"feels like\" temperature -- is an important indicator of a summer day's weather. The heat index is what the temperature feels like to the human body, combining the air temperature with the relative humidity. When considering temperature regulation for the body, the heat index is an important factor.\n\nWhen the body becomes too hot, it perspires to cool itself. When the perspiration cannot evaporate due to high humidity, the body cannot cool down. This means, in areas with high humidity, the body feels warmer due to a decreased rate of evaporation. When you hear people reference \"dry heat\", the temperature only feels cooler because your body can better regulate itself. (weather.gov)\n\nIt's important to note that the heat index is calculated based on shady locations. If you are exposed to direct sunlight, the heat index value can increase up to 15 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nHeat Index Levels:\n\n(Categorized by the National Weather Service)\n\nCaution: 80F-90F: Fatigue possible with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity.\n\nExtreme Caution: 90-103F: Heat stroke, heat cramps or heat exhaustion possible with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity.\n\nDanger: 103F-124F: Heat cramps or heat exhaustion likely and heat stroke possible with prolonged exposure and/or physical activity\n\nExtreme Danger: 125F and above: Heat stroke highly likely.\n\nUnderstanding Heat Warnings:\n\nAs high temperatures maintain in our region, it's important to understand the various heat warnings.\n\nExcessive Heat Outlooks: Heat outlooks are issued when there is potential for an excessive heat event in the next three to seven days. Outlooks provide warning to those who need lead-time to prepare for such an event. This may include the elderly, people experiencing \u2003\u2003 housing insecurity, those with animals and more.\n\nExcessive Heat Watch: Heat watches are distributed when conditions are favorable for an excessive heat event in the next 24 to 72 hours. These warnings are meant for preparedness but are released when its occurrence and timing is somewhat uncertain.\n\nHeat Advisory: These warnings are issued within 12 hours of extremely dangerous heat conditions. The rule of thumb for heat advisory warnings is when the maximum heat index is expected to be 100 degrees or higher for at least two days; and nighttime temperatures don't drop below 75 degrees. When a heat advisory is issued, it is important to take caution and limit strenuous activities and time outdoors. If air conditioning is not available, consider a cooling center like the library or shopping center.\n\nExcessive Heat Warning: Like heat advisory warnings, these warnings are issued within 12 hours of extremely dangerous heat conditions when the maximum heat index is expected \u2003\u2003 to be 105 degrees Fahrenheit or more for at least two days and when night air temperatures do not drop below 75 degrees Fahrenheit. If no precautions are taken during an extreme weather event, individuals have a high risk of heat illness or even death.\n\nAfter the yearly, widespread cabin fever of winter, people are eager to get outside, but we must remember: a sunny day does not always mean perfect weather.

The UN just issued a wake-up call.", "body": "\"If there is one thing that unites our divided world, it is that we are all increasingly feeling the heat,\" said United Nations (UN) Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres today as he issued a Global Call to Action on Extreme Heat. The first-of-its-kind report, which I contributed to in my capacity as the UN's global chief heat officer, emphasizes the urgent need for actionable heat-related measures and policies worldwide.\n\nIn the Call to Action, the secretary-general makes clear that governments and policymakers must protect and care for the lives and livelihoods of frontline communities, protect workers, advance the evidence base to drive innovative resilience solutions, and limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nThis clear recognition from the Office of the Secretary-General is an important moment for us all. Extreme heat is often underestimated and ignored, but its impacts are unavoidable. The planet is heating up faster than we thought. We are outside scientific model predictions and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and devastating.\n\nRising heat affects our major critical systems -- such as water, energy, food, transportation, and communications. It also feeds mega droughts, wildfires, and storms, creating cascading and compounding crises. It's a global crisis. But we are not ready for any of it. We're sleepwalking.\n\nIn my work as global chief heat officer and first chief heat officer for the city of Athens, I have worked directly with cities and have seen the impacts of heat firsthand. Cities are heating up at twice the rate of the global average. At 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming, sixty-seven cities will experience 150 or more days per year of temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit). At 2 degrees Celsius, the number jumps to ninety-four cities. At just under 3 degrees Celsius of global warming, it soars to 197 cities.\n\nPolicies to address extreme heat so far remain scattered, disjointed, and underfunded. But the rising temperatures mark a global crisis with local impacts. That's why the global focus of the UN's Call to Action is so crucial. Increasingly, our world is facing challenges that go beyond the capacity and limited mandate of single nation states. We're facing crises, like climate change, that need international cooperation to support and facilitate equitable, multilevel, science-based decision making and solutions. The UN is the only legitimate multilateral governance structure able to address issues that need global mobilization and localized solutions. As cities take on climate change, they need support at every level.\n\nIn 2022, globally, humanity spent a little over one trillion dollars on adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change. For comparison, the world spent $11.7 trillion on COVID-19 emergency fiscal measures in 2020 alone. As temperatures rise, this funding gap is a dangerous threat. And there is another issue that needs to be urgently addressed: In 2022, about one trillion dollars went to financing emissions mitigation, while only one hundred billion dollars went to adaptation and resilience-building initiatives. We urgently need both climate adaptation and resilience financing.\n\nThe UN's Call to Action is an important milestone for climate resilience, but it is also only the beginning. As the document explains, the world urgently needs a Global Action Strategy to \"mobilize governments, policy makers, and all stakeholders to act, prevent, and reduce heat risk.\" A dedicated trust fund for urban heat resilience initiatives is also needed, because cities are on the frontlines of extreme heat, and they are where more than half of the world's population lives -- a share that is expected to rise to seven-in-ten people by midcentury. Finally, more dedicated heat champions, like the community of chief heat officers established by the Arsht-Rock Resilience Center, with heat resilience departments that can articulate the challenges and co-create the best solutions are needed. These champions are critical to ensuring that the dangers of -- and the solutions to -- extreme heat are understood widely.\n\nEach of these essential efforts, as well as others, requires building an international consensus around the scope of the problem and its solutions. Here, the UN's Call to Action on Extreme Heat can help shape conversations in positive directions at upcoming conferences such as Climate Week NYC and this year's UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, also known as COP29.

Here are the heat illness symptoms you should watch for.", "body": "It's easy to forget about the risk of heat exhaustion or sunstroke when you're enjoying a pool party or hanging out at the beach, but these serious conditions can and do happen. Ahead, three emergency room physicians answer questions about how to stay safe when it's scorching out -- from being able to identify symptoms to the most effective ways to keep cool.\n\nWhy should I care about heat illness now?\n\nSummer is when temperatures are the highest in the U.S. As temperatures soared last year, so did ER visits for heat illness. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published in April found that there were nearly 120,000 heat-related emergency room visits in 2023, and 90% of them happened between May and September.The most ER visits happened in Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, with males and adults between the ages of 18 and 64 having the highest rates of ER visits for heat illness.\n\nHeat is also the deadliest form of extreme weather, the National Weather Service warns. Hot weather kills 1,220 people annually, according to the CDC. And tolls are rising each year, amid climate change. Last year was the hottest in human history, and a record-breaking 2,303 people died from heat exposure, the Department of Health and Human Services estimates.\n\n\"With hotter summer months rapidly approaching, it's important to plan ahead to protect yourself and others from heat illness,\" Dr. Marc Taub, an emergency physician and medical director of emergency services at MemorialCare Saddleback Medical Center in Laguna Hills, Calif., tells Yahoo Life. \"It's especially important to take precautions for those who are more vulnerable to the heat, such as children, older adults, pregnant persons, those who work outdoors, people without ready access to cool areas and fluids and people with underlying health conditions.\"\n\nWhat exactly is heat illness?\n\nHeat illness (also known as heat-related illness) is an umbrella term used to describe several conditions that can happen to your body when temperatures rise.\n\nHeat illness generally refers to these conditions:\n\nSymptoms of heat illness vary depending on the type you experience. Here's a breakdown, according to the CDC:\n\nIt depends on the type of heat illness you have. Heat rash and heat cramps are \"generally uncomfortable if you are healthy,\" Dr. Lewis Nelson, chair of emergency medicine at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, tells Yahoo Life. However, they are not usually serious.\n\nBut anyone can experience heat exhaustion and heat stroke -- the latter of which is life-threatening, he points out.\n\n\"With heat stroke, you can develop organ problems, kidney failure, heart problems and stroke-like symptoms,\" Dr. Eric Adkins, emergency medicine physician at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Yahoo Life. \"You can die from heat stroke.\"\n\nI am having symptoms. What should I do?\n\nDoctors recommend getting out of the heat ASAP if you don't feel well. \"The most important intervention if you feel sick in the heat is to move to a cooler area,\" Nelson says. \"This may be as simple as moving out of the sun or going indoors.\"\n\nUsing a fan can speed up the evaporation of sweat and help you cool down, but Nelson points out that it's \"not very efficient\" at higher temperatures. In fact, the Environmental Protection Agency recommends that people don't use fans when the heat index temperature, which is a combination of the temperature and humidity, is above 99 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n\"Making sure you are adequately hydrated is critical and replacing the lost sweat with water, plus electrolytes will help avoid a fall in your blood sodium level,\" Nelson says.\n\nIt's also a good idea to take off extra clothes and put on wet towels, if you have them nearby, to help cool you down, Adkins says. Spraying water on your body can also help, according to Taub.\n\nIf someone is showing symptoms of heat stroke, call 911 immediately. The NWS also urges getting \"immediate medical attention\" if heat cramps last for more than an hour, the person vomits or if heat exhaustion symptoms get worse or last for more than an hour.\n\nHow can I stay informed about heat risks?\n\nThe CDC just launched a Heat & Health Tracker to make it easier to know what's happening with heat in your area. The tracker offers local heat and health information, including rates of emergency room visits for heat illness where you live. The CDC also notes which medications might make you more vulnerable to the effects of heat, and how to store them safely when temperatures rise.\n\n\"Keep track of daily weather forecasts and local heat alerts,\" Taub says. \"Good sources of information on current and forecasted weather include local news channels and weather websites.\" He also suggests checking out Heat.gov for up-to-date information and forecasts.\n\nMy car is always sizzling in the summer. How can I keep myself cool?\n\nCar temperatures can skyrocket, and research has found that interior temperatures can hit 116 degrees and seats can get up to 123 degrees.\n\n\"Getting into a hot car for a brief period of time is generally safe, but opening the windows or turning on the air conditioning should help moderate the temperature,\" Nelson says. \"The inside of a car, especially in the sun, can reach unsafe temperatures if not cooled, so do not keep children or pets in closed cars, even if out of the sun.\"\n\nAdkins recommends parking in the shade when you can. A sun shade in your car can help to deflect heat away from the interior as well, Taub says. If your car doesn't have air conditioning and it's extremely hot outside, Adkins suggests taking public transportation if it's available.\n\nWhat are the most effective ways to stay cool?\n\nIf you feel yourself getting hot, there are a few things you can do to cool off in the moment.\n\nDrinking plenty of water is an obvious choice, but Adkins also recommends keeping an eye on the color of your urine. \"If it looks more pale yellow, you're hydrated,\" he says. \"If it's dark yellow, orange or brown, that's a primary sign of dehydration.\"\n\nUsing fans, including portable fans, when the heat index is below 99 degrees can be helpful, along with misting yourself with cool water, Nelson says. Putting cool, wet cloths on your wrists, neck and ankles can help keep your temperature down, too, Adkins says.\n\nIs there anything else I can do?\n\nDoctors say there are a few other moves you can make to keep yourself cool on hot days. A big one is avoiding being outside on the hottest times of the day -- typically between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. -- if you're able, Adkins says.\n\nNelson also suggests carrying around a bottle of water with you to make sure you're staying well hydrated. Carrying a portable fan in your bag and using it when you need to cool off can also be helpful, according to Adkins.\n\nIf you want to really plan ahead, Adkins recommends planting trees on your property to create shade for the future.\n\nOverall, doctors stress the importance of being aware of the heat in your area and taking steps to keep yourself cool. \"Exposure to excess heat can be serious -- and it's important to take it seriously,\" Adkins says.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "korin_miller@yahoo.com", "name": "Korin

That year, a category 3 heat wave - the most severe tier -- was named Zoe.\n\nThe naming project was a collaboration between the Seville city council and the Adrienne Arsht-Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center (Arsht-Rock), an American foundation that focuses on building resilient communities in the face of climate change.\n\n\"Seville is an incredibly hot city, I think people, anyone who's been to Seville or honestly been in Europe this summer will know that it's been incredibly hot and it's only getting hotter,\" said Owen Gow, deputy director of the Extreme Heat Initiative at Arsht-Rock.\n\n\"We named four heat waves starting with I think what was the most widely publicized, and reported on heat waves Zoe, and having the city council as a close partner ... [it] was [an] incredibly valuable start.\"\n\nIn 2021, a ranking system was launched in Athens, Greece, ranking heat waves from zero to three. That program has since expanded to six other cities.\n\nGow says that both Australia and the U.K. are interested in developing their own heat wave ranking systems.\n\nBy this time next year, the state of California will also have a heat wave ranking system, which is being developed by the California Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nBut not everyone thinks naming heat waves is a good idea.\n\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada told CBC News that naming heat waves might misdirect attention from important messaging.\n\n\"Though naming heat waves may raise public and media awareness of the event, it also misdirects the attention away from messaging, including information on vulnerability and protective actions,\" wrote a spokesperson for ECCC in a statement to CBC.\n\n\"Development of heat-health warning systems and action plans, in partnership with public health and emergency management decision-makers, is the government of Canada's current focus in preparation for extreme heat events.\"\n\nAdvocates for a naming or ranking system say it could compel governments to take the health risks associated with heat more seriously.\n\n\"We need to start talking about heat and reflecting the true risks associated with heat,\" said Metz.\n\nAccording to Statistics Canada, in Canada's 12 major cities from 2000 to 2020, about 670 excess non-accidental deaths, 115 excess cardiovascular deaths, and 115 excess respiratory deaths are attributable to the increased mortality risks during extreme heat.\n\n\"I think it's important to bring heat into the equation the same way we're recognizing ... wildfire smoke, flood risk, even risks from hurricanes and storms as potentially serious, damaging to physical property, and harmful to human health and well-being,\" said Metz.\n\n\"Heat is responsible for more illnesses and deaths compared to any other weather hazards combined.\"\n\nWith global temperatures rising, Gow says it's important we start to update city infrastructure, and create emergency response plans for heat, to ensure they are prepared for what's to come.\n\n\"We've seen records being broken for the last several years, and I don't think we can count anymore on those records being maintained or staying the same ... we are now in a situation where we need to prepare for a future that looks vastly different.\"", "source":

Even so, companies and safety managers alike are fighting to keep up, not just with the array of regulations and recommendations, but with practical policies to save their employees from harm that can be life-threatening.\n\nWith 92 million workers impacted by heat stress in the United States each year, few of us need additional reasons to pay attention to this issue. But beyond keeping workers as acclimated, cool, and hydrated as possible, be sure you also know some of the surprising ways that heat can affect your workers' well-being, and your safety record, and what you can do to help.\n\nObviously, heat-related injuries like heat exhaustion and heat stroke tend to rise in higher temperatures, but did you know accidents in which heat is NOT directly involved also increase on hot days? A 2021 study by the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs showed that the risk of accidents like falls, struck-by incidents, and pinches or crushes continues to rise along with the temperature. Workers are 6 to 9 percent more likely to have accidents in temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit and 10 to 15 percent more likely when temperatures rise above 100 degrees. With the heat routinely rising into triple digits in many areas of the country, making workers aware of this increase in risk may be a good first step to keeping them more vigilant.\n\nOne thing that may explain those accident statistics is the finding by Scientific American that we actually make worse decisions and have trouble thinking clearly when we're overheated. This doesn't just refer to people who are experiencing heat illness. Even people whose bodies are coping well with high temperatures still have impaired thinking. The jaw dropper in this study is that overheated brains tend to make simpler and more straightforward decisions, even when they lead to worse results. Additionally, our brains have trouble processing complex decisions when we're overheated. This is bad news for safety since an overheated worker may decide it's simpler to skirt safety rules when they're hot and not thinking clearly. And workers doing complex tasks and leading work crews are likely at even higher risk. While you can't change the way the brain works, you can take a look at your policies and jobsites to see where you can make decisions simpler. Build in extra checks for hot workdays including buddy systems and reminders. Wherever possible, consider breaking complex tasks down into simpler ones as temperatures rise.\n\nYou probably know that heavier workers or those suffering from heart disease or diabetes are more vulnerable in hot environments. But there are many other health conditions that can put workers at risk. Health issues as common as high blood pressure or even seasonal allergies can add vulnerabilities due to the effects of medication treatments. Even people with anxiety or mood disorders or those struggling with substance use disorders are more likely to end up in the emergency room while working in the heat. Some illnesses or medications literally weaken the body's ability to properly hydrate or to respond to high temperatures. Other conditions may simply put enough strain on a worker's body that they have fewer resources to cope in the heat. Either way, it's an important topic for toolbox talks and safety training to make workers aware that they may be at higher risk and need to adjust their routines accordingly. Whether that's requesting additional breaks, upping their fluid intake, or brainstorming solutions with their doctor, encourage everyone to advocate for personal needs that their manager may not know about.\n\nAn often-overlooked danger during heat waves is people's inability to fully cool down, even at night. Workers without adequate (or any) home air conditioning may find themselves trying to sleep in warm, humid environments, leaving them sleep-deprived and less able to stay alert and make good decisions, leading to increased accidents. Living constantly at elevated temperatures without the ability to fully cool down also makes workers more susceptible to heat illness on the job. Although you probably can't change where people live, you can take steps to help. Consider allowing employees to take their cooling gear home with them overnight during a heat wave. Offer before, during, and after-shift cooling opportunities in air-conditioned trailers or buildings to allow people to get their body temperatures back to normal before they head back out into the heat. You might even consider hosting workers' families for after-hours cool-downs.\n\nAs the number of days in a heat wave increase, so does absenteeism on the job. Surveys show that everyone from steel workers to garment sewers say they're more likely to call in sick when a heat wave drags on beyond a week or so. Here too, making work a good place to cool down can help workers to keep showing up.\n\nIn general, be sure you're checking all the boxes for heat safety, including:\n\nHot days and heat waves may require extra reminders, extra checks, and of course, increased cooling measures and breaks to provide as much relief from the heat as possible.

If finalized, the rule would establish the first major federal safety of its kind: one that protects an estimated 36 million workers from heat exposure injuries on the job. Workers covered by the rule would include farmworkers, delivery workers, workers in factories/kitchens/warehouses, and tradespeople -- including HVAC professionals, whose work often takes them into attics that can far surpass 100\u00b0 on a summer afternoon.\n\nThe rule was highlighted as one of the five steps the Biden administration is taking to address extreme weather. The rule comes during a time when the effects of extreme weather are current and imminent -- specifically Hurricane Beryl, which ripped through the Caribbean in late June/early July.\n\nAccording to ABC7, Biden noted that there are human and financial costs from climate change, saying that weather-inflicted damage last year cost the economy $90 billion.\n\n\"More people die from extreme heat than floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes combined,\" Biden said. \"These climate-fueled extreme weather events don't just affect people's lives. They also cost money. They hurt the economy, and they have a significant negative psychological effect on people.\"\n\nBiden also said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was also finalizing a rule to factor in possible flooding risks for federal construction projects. Additionally, FEMA was announcing $1 billion in grants to help communities deal with natural disasters, while the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was releasing a new report on climate change's impacts.\n\nDespite the increased awareness of potential health risks from high temperatures, extreme heat protections -- for those routinely exposed to heat index readings above 80\u00b0F -- have lagged.\n\nUnder the proposed rule, employers would be required to identify heat hazards, develop emergency response plans related to heat illness, and provide training to employees on the signs and symptoms of related illnesses. Employers would also be required to establish breaks for employees to rest, provide both shade and water in extreme conditions, and ensure heat acclimatization -- or the building of tolerance to higher temperatures -- for new workers.\n\nThose who refuse to do so will face penalties for heat-related violations in workplaces that would increase significantly, in line with what workplaces are issued for violations of Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) rules, according to a senior White House administration official.\n\nIn 2023, an estimated 2,300 people died from heat-related illnesses. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), workers with prolonged exposure to extreme heat are among the most vulnerable to related health risks, such as heatstroke and other related illnesses.\n\nSince 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has been working on developing a standard for how workplaces deal with heat and, last year, OSHA held meetings to hear about how the proposed measures could affect small businesses.\n\nHowever, heat protection laws in the U.S. have faced consistent industry opposition, from chambers of commerce to other business associations, with many feeling that a blanket mandate would be difficult to implement across such a wide range of industries.\n\nOnly five states currently have workplace standards for heat exposure in place: California, Colorado, Oregon, Minnesota, and Washington. Some regulations have recently come under attack. Within the past year, Florida and Texas passed legislation preventing local governments from requiring heat protections for outdoor workers.\n\nIf finalized, the rule would override state measures, and states with existing procedures to deal with heat would have to institute measures that are at least as stringent as the finalized federal rule.\n\nBiden said his administration would hold a conference titled \"White House Summer on Extreme Heat\" in the coming months.", "source": {"uri": "achrnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The ACHR NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We know about it since the 1950s, but if you open an occupational safety and health textbook written back then, you would find that it is maybe dangerous for bakers or workers in metal foundries - that is specialized occupations. And what our report found is that the scope of the problem is much larger than that. About 2.4 billion workers, or 71 per cent of the global labour force, are exposed to extreme heat at work. And in the last 20 years the exposure share increased by almost nine per cent. We identified 22.8 million occupational injuries attributable to extreme heat, almost 19,000 deaths and over 26 million cases of kidney diseases which are a result of prolonged exposure to heat during work.\n\nUN News: What are the new professions and what are the new threats that have appeared compared to those estimates that were 50 or 70 years ago?\n\nThe main realization is that this is really impacting the majority of the labour force. It's not only few specialized occupations where there are artificial heat sources. It is not only agriculture or construction, but indoor workers, especially if in not properly ventilated workplaces, - they are all exposed to heat. And then workers, because of they are at work, tend to be exposed for a longer period of time. They cannot avoid it.\n\nI think that the main understanding or the main realization is that it's really a global problem in the sense of both geography and the distribution of the labour force.\n\nUN News: Your report covers all regions. Do you see difference in response to the dangers that there are based on the fact that in some regions heat factor is something that has been there for ages, but in other it might be something that is new, that is coming with this climate change?\n\nBalint Nafradi: A big part of the exposure to heat on workers is coming from the sun. And obviously, in the regions or countries which are warmer the problem already existed before. That's 70 per cent of the exposed labour force is a global average. In such regions such as Africa it's over 90 per cent and in the Arab states it's over 80 per cent. Of course, there are variations, because in Europe, especially in northern parts of Europe, it's less than 30 per cent. So there is this geographical variation.\n\nRegions which tend to be colder, like Europe, showed much faster than average increase in the past 10 years. So, in terms of response that makes two different difficulties.\n\nFor the regions where there is a big, sizable exposure already today, the difficulty is to mitigate this occupational safety and health hazard. For the regions where the exposure is relatively low but rapidly growing, the problem is to adapt to this newly changing working environment. It's a difference if the temperature is 25, 35 or 45 degrees Celsius. This brings us to the topic of heat waves and the discussion of those. The share or the importance of heat waves increased fastest in the Americas. But still the report indicates that nine out of 10 workers who is exposed, they are exposed outside of heat waves. If you like, heat waves are the tip of the iceberg which gives the visibility to the problem, but the majority of workers are actually exposed in times where there is no official warning issued.\n\nUN News: In this situation, are there any policies introduced currently? What is the reaction to that new and constantly growing challenge?\n\nBalint Nafradi: There is guidance specific to heat exposure. The ILO produced the Code of Practice on the Working Environment, which has a chapter on how to protect workers against heat exposure. There are specific international labour standards. They have guidance on protecting certain groups of workers.\n\nWe found that most of the countries have some sort of labour law in place, but most of those are old and they are not designed with taking into account this huge share of the labour force which is exposed.\n\nWe also identified several cases all over the globe where the labour law was recently updated: for example, temperature limits are set depending on the activities. It's usually not only the temperature that's important, but other factors like humidity or air movements which are there in many of these recently updated legislations. In most places acclimatization or hydration, requirements for working intensity, or the adaptation of the working intensity to the temperature are in the law. Those are the positive signs that we found. But many of those laws are responding mostly to heat waves which I mentioned before. That's only one out of 10 workers, so one out of 10 exposures. The other nine still need to be considered and workers need protection.\n\nThe important part is to have the labour laws updated, but in this updating process, social dialogue is really important. The active involvement of both workers and employers, because they are the fist to know what risks are out there and how to best respond to them. We put 21 countries in our report all over the world from Europe, also Japan and China, Mexico of South Africa - really a lot of countries. The local realities are different over there. Many of the updated laws have specific guidance for the work intensity. There are different rules that apply if it's a heavy physical activity, or if it's an office work, etcetera.\n\nThere is also advice to adapt the working arrangements to the temperature. It's not necessarily shifting working hours because we also know that shift work or night work is on its own particularly dangerous. We don't want to be in a situation that we replace one hazard with another. But there are a lot of practices which can be done: like making the heavy part, the physically heavy work in the hours that are not hot, and the other activities in the warmer periods. Also a practice which is highly recommended is to provide shade or areas where workers can avoid heat or can escape from heat. Providing water and hydration is a really important safety measure.\n\nEducation and awareness raising both for workers and the employers is important so that they know that heat is a hazard. And that's, of course particularly important for the regions where it is fastly growing. We'll assume that in Africa, everyone knows that heat is a problem. But in northern Europe, which is one of the fastest increasing parts, one needs to adopt the thinking that if a week of hot weather is coming that was great 20 years ago, nowadays it's a week of 35 plus degrees Celsius. And that's the heat which could be a hazard for work.\n\nUN News: There is Olympics starting in Paris and athletes are workers, right? As well as those thousands of people who will be servicing the Olympics, making this big sports events a great success. Are there any recommendations you would share on how to stay fit without any bad consequences health wise due to the heat?\n\nBalint Nafradi: I will maybe start with a fun fact: one of the first studies from the 1950s, which studied the heat effect on human performance was done by professional athletes. So, we know for a fact that athletes just because they are in good physical conditions, they are not immune to heat. So they have to take care.\n\nAs for the rest of us, the usual outdoor activities and the guidance that applies is to stay hydrated. Be in the shade as much as you can and don't be in direct sun unless it's absolutely necessary. Minimize those hours as much as you can. And the third recommendation would be to avoid heavy physical activities. But I guess, for the Olympics that's not really a particularly useful advice. It is heat and if you see someone in the crowd or your coworkers, colleagues, whatever, feeling dizzy, take care and alert the helpline.", "source": {"uri": "news.un.org", "dataType": "news", "title":

Following the recent record-setting day of global temperatures, Guterres declared, \"Extreme heat is the new abnormal,\" urging nations to confront the escalating crisis fueled by climate change.\n\nThis year has already seen unprecedented heatwaves causing severe impacts, including the deaths of 1,300 hajj pilgrims, school closures affecting 80 million children, and a significant rise in hospitalizations and fatalities in the Sahel.\n\nThe UN's appeal comes after a series of consecutive hottest days ever recorded, as confirmed by the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service. Since June 2023, every month has marked a new high in global temperatures. Guterres stressed the urgency of not only reducing fossil fuel emissions but also enhancing protections for the most vulnerable -- such as the elderly, children, and outdoor workers.\n\nAccording to the International Labour Organization, over 70 percent of the global workforce, or 2.4 billion people, are now at high risk from extreme heat, with Africa and the Arab States bearing the brunt of this crisis.\n\nThe UN's recommendations include improving heatwave warning systems, expanding passive cooling techniques, and strengthening urban design to mitigate the effects of extreme temperatures. Guterres emphasized that while the UN can coordinate and offer support, significant action must come from individual countries.\n\nAddressing the broader implications of this crisis, he noted that extreme heat exacerbates inequality and food insecurity, pushing more people into poverty.

The latter is particularly important as air temperature gets close to, or even above skin temperature.\n\nHowever, this comes with a physiological \"cost\" in the form of greater cardiovascular strain, dehydration (where fluid replacement is insufficient), and an increased perception of effort (i.e. how hard it feels) which may result in a reduction in performance (i.e. slowing down).\n\nIndeed, these processes can only achieve so much, and it is possible that for highly motivated athletes, the combination of environmental heat and work rate that they sustain will exceed the body's heat loss capability.\n\nThis can result in uncontrolled elevations in deep body temperature which can cause heat illnesses, such as heat exhaustion through to exertional heat stroke.\n\nAthletes can use heat acclimatisation, cooling and hydration strategies to increase their ability to withstand these conditions.\n\nAnd organisers can schedule events to cooler venues or change regulations, e.g. shortening of events, introduction of cooling breaks.\n\nHowever, the sporting spectacles of the future may soon look different from those which we are accustomed to.", "source": {"uri": "express.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "EXPRESS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hanna_geissler@express.co.uk", "name": "Hanna Geissler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thermoregulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hemodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fluid replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acclimatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Thermodynamics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Thermodynamics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/151/1200x630/5518205.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

In fact, heat has become the most prevalent lethal factor among all weather-related fatalities, according to the National Weather Service. To address the threat to worker safety and lives posed by rising global climate trends, the Biden-Harris administration recently announced a proposed rule to substantially reduce heat injuries, illnesses, and deaths in the workplace. The proposed rule would be \"the first-ever federal regulation on heat stress in the workplace.\"\n\nThe proposed rule would require employers to conduct heat hazardous identification and assessment, develop a heat injury and illness prevention plan, provide indoor work area control, and allocate time and area for rest breaks. The rule also would require employers to provide training and education in their workplace.\n\nThe new standard has two heat index triggers that apply nationwide. When temperatures reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the proposal would require employers to provide workers with drinking water, as well as a place and time to take breaks and help employees acclimatize to working in extreme heat. When temperatures reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit, employers would be required to provide employees with 15-minute rest breaks every two hours and monitor for symptoms of heat-related illnesses.\n\nBy establishing a federal standard, the proposed rule would benefit a vast number of U.S. workers and enhance equity. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 33% of workers in 2023 were exposed to the outdoors as a regular part of their job. Furthermore, Black, African American, Hispanic, or Latino workers -- who make up roughly 32% of the U.S. population -- comprise 45% of all workers in outdoor conditions.\n\n2024 could be the hottest year on record. Worsening climatic conditions mean that workers who work outdoors and indoors in high temperatures are more at risk. The proposed rule is therefore a necessary policy effort to protect workers amid the ongoing global climate crisis.", "source": {"uri": "epi.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Policy Institute"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyperthermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://files.epi.org/uploads/iStock-1466821179-950x632.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

In nearby Henderson, Nevada, it prompted officials to open up \"polar pods,\" according to the Guardian.\n\nEven longtime residents of Las Vegas may have been shocked by the heat wave that hit in early July. The city saw five straight days with a high temperature of 115 degrees Fahrenheit or more, breaking the old record of four consecutive days set in July 2005, per the Guardian. It also hit a record high of 120 degrees on July 7.\n\n\"This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,\" said John Adair, a meteorologist who has worked with the National Weather Service for 30 years.\n\nLas Vegas resident Alyse Sobosan won't walk her dogs until 9 p.m. or later.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" Sobosan told The Guardian. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nHenderson reportedly became the first town in southern Nevada to employ \"polar pods\" during the extreme heat. The pods can collapse into compact bags, making them easily portable, per News 3. Cold water can flow in the watertight pods around someone suffering heat distress, rapidly cooling them and potentially saving their life.\n\nHeat can be hazardous to our health, causing heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Human activities, such as the burning of dirty fuels, have exacerbated the issue.\n\nJournalist and climate tech investor Molly Wood explained that rising global temperatures are \"like steroids\" for our weather, making events such as dangerous heat waves more likely to occur.\n\nThe National Weather Service reports that heat has been the leading cause of weather-related deaths in our country for at least 30 years. On average, heat has killed more people during the past three decades than floods, lightning, and hurricanes combined.\n\nThis summer, heat is suspected to be the cause of death of at least 16 people in Oregon, per KGW8.\n\nInvestigations into heat-related deaths can take several days or even months, so it is difficult to determine how many have perished from it this year. As of July 12, health officials in Maricopa County, Arizona, had reported 14 confirmed heat-related deaths in 2024, with another 234 deaths still under investigation, per the Arizona Republic.\n\nOn some days, ABC News reported, more than 150 million people in the United States were under heat alerts.\n\nOur planet just recorded its 13th consecutive warmest month on record in June, with our world warming from an increase in heat-trapping gases in our atmosphere. Anything we can do to reduce the amount of those gases released into our atmosphere and cool our planet can help.\n\nWe can all make better, cleaner choices in our daily lives. This can include using our purchasing power for good and supporting brands that advocate for a better future. Vacationing responsibly by using low-impact travel options and supporting eco-friendly travel sites can also have an impact.\n\nMany small actions also come with big monetary perks, too.

Once-temperate Paris has warmed 1.8C since it last hosted the Olympics in 1924, according to a recent report that also details a rise in \"scorching days\" and a 2,100% increase in tropical nights. The same stone buildings, zinc rooftops and narrow streets that make Paris so charming can also make it swelter.\n\nBlevins is just one athlete among thousands who are finding ways to contend with it. Other events to be held in the heat-prone city center include beach volleyball, archery, cycling, athletics, football, hockey, and tennis.\n\nAmong the most grueling Olympic events is likely to be the marathon, which starts at the large plaza at Paris City Hall, an area with a high density of zinc rooftops and lack of vegetation. Nearly 80% of Paris' rooftops are made of zinc, which can heat up to 90C (194F) on a sunny day, heating the area around them.\n\nThe race continues along the Seine, which cools the air around it by several degrees, before diverting around Opera, one of the hottest areas in the city. Building materials, urban density and narrow streets combine to trap heat in some parts of the city, making them more prone to the urban heat island effect, where temperatures rise above surrounding rural areas.\n\nAn analysis in The Lancet last year ranked Paris as the European capital most vulnerable to heat waves, but the city is far from anomalous. All over the world, a growing number of athletic events face rising heat risk as climate change turns up the global thermostat. For Olympics organizers, coaches and athletes, that means developing a comprehensive heat playbook -- from low-tech measures such as proper hydration to sophisticated sensors that help athletes maintain peak performance without sacrificing safety.\n\n\"The heat sometimes brings this physiological panic response where your whole system is telling you to get out of there and go cool off,\" says Blevins. \"Racing is always going to be a game of pushing beyond what your body's telling you. I think that you run into interesting territory when that's compounded by extreme heat.\"\n\nThe harder the human body works, the hotter it gets. Roughly 80% of the energy generated by performing muscular exercises is released as heat, according to Mike Sawka, an environmental physiologist and professor at Georgia Tech. When external temperatures are cool, it's easy for the body to dissipate that heat through thermal radiation and sweat. But when temperatures soar, and especially when it's humid, the body struggles to keep up.\n\n\"The athlete is not a roasted chicken in an oven. He is not cooked by the environment,\" says Dr. Sebastien Racinais, heat expert in the International Olympic Committee's Medical and Scientific Commission Games Group. \"The athlete is producing the heat himself or herself.\"\n\nThis is also why athletic performance often declines when it's hot: The body has to devote more resources to cooling itself down. At rest, a human heart might pump five liters of blood per minute to move nutrients and waste around the body. Exercise can bring that to more like 15 liters per minute, but heat will force the body to pull some of that blood out of main circulation and into the skin for cooling. At that point, \"it's harder to maintain that needed blood cardiac output and blood pressure regulation,\" says Sawka.\n\nThe impacts are most acute when it comes to the intensity and duration of athletic performance, which is why Racinais says the marathon, half-marathon and 10,000-meter races are the Olympics' highest-risk events. \"This is the window where you have both intensity high enough to produce a lot of heat and duration long enough for this heat to accumulate,\" he says.\n\nKristian Blummenfelt, a Norwegian triathlete who won the gold in Tokyo, says heat stress makes for a special kind of suffering. \"You can be forced to be standing still on a bike or on the road, not because you are in poor shape but just the heat is basically killing your legs,\" he says.\n\nIn the marathon stage of the 2022 Ironman World Championships -- held in Kona, Hawaii, where temperatures reached 31C with 65% humidity -- Blummenfelt fell off pace with 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) left in the race. \"My core temperature went through the roof, up to almost 41C,\" he says. A core body temperature of 40C or higher is a sign of heat stroke that, if not properly treated, can be fatal. In this case, the consequences were less severe: Blummenfelt's fellow Norwegian Gustav Iden pulled away to win the race, leaving him to finish third.\n\nA CORE sensor worn by Blummenfelt provides insight into an athlete's physiological response when his core body temperature peaked at an estimated 40.8C and needed medical attention.\n\nThe good news is that athletes can adapt. \"When you introduce a specific stress on the human body, it will adapt to this specific stress,\" Racinais says. And because adapting can mean the difference between an Olympic medal and the emergency room, athletes are increasingly focused on tactics for achieving it. The most critical piece of adaptation is training in the heat. A few weeks before competing in Tokyo in 2021, Blummenfelt traveled to Thailand to train; in the leadup to Paris, he's been incorporating heat training into sessions in the French Pyrenees. Blevins, who lives and trains in Santa Cruz, California, dons five layers of clothing for indoor heat-training rides, which he complements with time in the sauna.\n\nIndian triathlete Pragnya Mohan usually trains in the UK, as much of India is too hot for most of the year to train outdoors. But the UK's milder conditions are a hindrance when she has to compete in hotter climates. Last year, Mohan had a competition in India during which temperatures were expected to hit 40C. She flew in two weeks early to acclimate.\n\nThis type of training essentially teaches the body to sweat more and to cool itself more efficiently. Even a week of exposure can make a big difference, says Brent Ruby, director of the Montana Center for Work Physiology and Exercise Metabolism at the University of Montana. \"We're the best animals on the planet as far as thermal regulation,\" Ruby says. \"But you have to have those critical talents dialed up. Otherwise, they're not going to work.\"\n\nStill, it's not enough to simply train in hot conditions and hope for the best. For athletes competing at the highest levels, even small adjustments on race day can be the difference between finishing on or off the podium. That's why many of them are turning to high-tech sensors to help monitor their body conditions both in training and during a competition.\n\nOne key indicator of heat stress is core body temperature, which in a lab or hospital setting is measured by clinicians using a rectal thermometer. This, of course, is not really an option for athletes. While there are experimental efforts to use ingestible thermometers, known as e-pills, they can be expensive and a hassle to deploy. It's also not necessary, says Ruby: By the time core temperature starts to rise, it's often too late to prevent problems.\n\nInstead, athletes like Blummenfelt are turning to CORE, a Swiss startup that makes a roughly $300 sensor for tracking heat strain. Founded in 2019, CORE uses a thermal energy transfer sensor -- also known as a heat flux sensor -- that athletes can wear on the same chest strap they already use for heart rate monitors. Made by CORE's parent company, GreenTeg, the sensor measures the flow of heat energy from the skin.\n\nImagine holding a metal wrench in one hand and a piece of paper in another. The surface temperature of each will be roughly the same because they are in the same ambient conditions, but the wrench will feel colder. This is because the thermal transfer from your hand to the metal is faster than it is to the paper. The nerves in your skin are acting as heat flux sensors. CORE's sensors do likewise, measuring the heat being thrown off by the body during exercise.\n\n\"The marketplace is starting to recognize that they don't need to obsess so much about measuring internal body temperature,\" Ruby says. \"Let's measure on the skin and combine that with something as simple as heart rate and athletes can make very smart decisions.\"\n\nAs an example of the insights that come from sensors, Ross McGraw, head of CORE and a professional triathlete himself, points to cyclists' habit of zipping up their jerseys and dousing themselves in water to cool off during mountain descents. This technique helps lower body temperatures, but CORE sensors showed that most riders aren't doing enough of it to prepare for the next climb. \"It's counterintuitive to dump more water on because it doesn't feel great,\" McGraw says. \"At that point, you're feeling chilly.\"\n\nMost athletes have other tools in their cool-down arsenal. Hydration is a universal obsession. Some use ice vests before and during events. Blevins brings a special cooling mattress, and at least eight nations will bring their own air conditioners to Paris, where the Olympic Village relies mainly on a geothermal cooling system. At the Tokyo Games, Blummenfelt's victory became a minor viral sensation because he wore a see-through white outfit, which his coach selected after CORE sensors determined the material kept the racers' bodies coolest.\n\nThe Olympics themselves are also making adjustments. In Tokyo, organizers shifted some scheduling to avoid the warmest parts of the day, and added an education campaign to teach athletes how to avoid exertional heat stroke (EHS). They also installed a \"heat deck\" at key sites, with medical equipment, inflatable pools of ice, and physicians trained in handling EHS. That setup, which will also be in place in Paris, made it easier to help athletes cool down in under 30 minutes, an important threshold for avoiding significant long-term health impacts.\n\nAll of these tactics will be increasingly necessary as the planet warms, especially if the Summer Olympics continue to be held in July and August -- often the hottest time of the year in the northern hemisphere. Scientists use the \"wet-bulb globe temperature\" -- which includes heat, humidity, wind speed, sun angle and cloud cover -- to quantify the danger rising heat poses to the human body. The higher the reading, the less sweat can evaporate, making it harder to cool down.\n\nMid-summer timing \"wasn't always the tradition,\" says Daniel Scott, professor and research chair in the department of geography and environmental management at the University of Waterloo. The first Paris Olympics in 1900 started in May, and the 1964 Summer Games in Tokyo -- the first Olympics held in Asia -- took place in October to avoid the city's humid summer climate. Scott says the current schedule is largely driven by the desire for TV ratings, as there are few other professional sports whose seasons compete for eyeballs in summer months.\n\nBut no matter how much athletes adjust for a warmer world, the heat takes a toll. After competing at 40C in India, Mohan needed almost a month to get back to normal. \"We are dehydrated. There's a lot of cramping. We might have diarrhea for a while. We might not be able to eat much,\" she says. Competing in extreme heat is \"almost like an illness. And it takes time to recover.\"", "source": {"uri": "bloomberg.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bloomberg Business"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And halfway to boiling,\" said Mr Guterres.\n\n\"The World Meteorological Organization, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and others have documented a rapid rise in the scale, intensity, frequency and duration of extreme-heat events,\" he said.\n\nExtreme heat is increasingly tearing through economies, widening inequalities, undermining the Sustainable Development Goals and killing people. It is estimated to kill almost half a million people a year, that's about 30 times more than tropical cyclones, pointed out Mr Guterres.\n\nThe Call to Action on Extreme Heat says there must be a concerted effort to enhance international cooperation to address extreme heat in four critical areas:\n\nIt brings together the expertise and perspectives of ten specialized UN entities, including extensive and detailed input from experts at WMO and in the WMO-WHO Joint Office on Climate and Health. It is a first-of-its-kind joint report underscoring the diverse multi-sectoral impacts of extreme heat on human health, lives, and livelihoods.. National and local governments and businesses who are the most impacted around the world also supported the launch of the Call to Action.\n\n\"Our Earth is running an unprecedently high fever,\" said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo. \"In addition to this week's three new global daily temperature records, we have seen monthly temperature records for 13 successive months.\"\n\n\"Widespread, intense and extended heatwaves have hit communities on every continent. At least ten countries have recorded temperatures of more than 50\u00b0 C in more than one location this year. Many dozens of locations have seen daytime maximum temperatures of more than 40\u00b0C and dangerously high minimum overnight temperatures,\" she said.\n\n\"The WMO community is working hard with many partners to strengthen heat-health action plans and early warnings to treat the symptoms of this fever. But, in addition, we need to tackle the root cause and urgently reduce greenhouse gas levels, which remain at record observed levels,\" said Celeste Saulo.\n\nThe Call to Action stresses the need to establish and bolster heat early warning systems in line with the Early Warnings for All initiative, ensuring at-risk populations receive timely alerts that include information on protective actions to undertake and sources of assistance. Strengthening capacities of National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) would be critical, it says.\n\nThere is good news, it says, heat illness and deaths are preventable and many impacts can be minimized with targeted economic and social policies and concrete actions, including public awareness campaigns.\n\nIt cites recent estimates produced by the WHO and WMO that the global scale-up of heat health-warning systems for 57 countries alone has the potential to save an estimated 98,314 lives per year.\n\nThe need is urgent. Modelled estimates show that between 2000 and 2019, approximately 489,000 heat-related deaths occurred each year, with 45 per cent of these in Asia and 36 per cent in Europe. Worldwide, the official diagnosis and reporting of heat-related illness, injuries and deaths are recognized to be under-reported. The lack of uniform reporting standards makes the aggregation and comparison of nationally reported impact statistics challenging, it says.\n\nEvery one of these deaths is preventable.", "source": {"uri": "public.wmo.int", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Meteorological Organization"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Meteorological_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Meteorological Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus_Climate_Change_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copernicus Climate Change Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_Saulo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celeste Saulo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development_Goals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable Development Goals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_warning_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Early warning system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Who"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone_Layer", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Ozone Layer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://public.wmo.int/sites/default/files/2024-07/image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 464, "textEnd": 471}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 512, "textEnd": 519}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

In the theme of providing transcripts of presentations I'm giving in various places for people who prefer the written word, this is the lightly edited transcript of the second half of our conversation. For those who missed the first half, here's the link.\n\nMichael Barnard (MB): Hi, welcome back to Redefining Energy - Tech. I'm your host, Michael Barnard. This is the second half of my discussion with Jan Rosenow, director of European programs at RAP, an expert on all things heat pumps. Always when I'm talking heat pumps, when I ask the question or somebody just brings it up because they're ticked off. Do you like the name heat pump or do you have a preferred term for heat pump?\n\nJan Rosenow (JR): I mean this, yeah, I've seen this many times. I don't think it's a problem that they're called heat pumps, I mean, whatever you call them, I don't think that's the main problem. I've just done an interview with Wired, the tech magazine in the US. I think they are based out of San Francisco. And they say the heat pump stories are the best, most read stories? Everyone wants to read about heat pumps. It's like, really? Yeah. But that seems to be like just heat pumps in the title and people click on them and want to read about them. The Guardian recently did a myth-busting series about heat pumps and it was hugely successful. I wrote an article for Carbon Brief on heat pumps and myths. Huge success. Lots of people clicked on it.\n\nSo I don't think there's a problem with the term as such. I think there's a lot of problems with the marketing. I mean, it's getting better now, but I think when you look at how this technology has been marketed and the customer experience, there's certainly been room for improvement. Just the design and the look of heat pumps, especially air source heat pumps. This gray box in your garden that looks ugly and not particularly nice. It's not very difficult to design a box that looks appealing. You don't have to be ugly. And there are no companies doing that. Making it look nice, slick, something that you can actually say, oh, look, yeah, look at my heat pump. A bit like a statement rather than just trying to hide it away because it's an ugly box. So we're seeing that changing.\n\nBut I think the term heat pump as such, I'm sitting on the fence. I haven't seen a better term come along. So I don't think that's the main issue really. I just wanted to bring up one more thing, Michael. When we went through these technologies, we were kind of talking about the supply of heat. Where does the supply of heat come from? What is the fuel that you're going to use to heat your home? The other big missing piece in this, of course, is there's still a lot of potential for demand-side reduction measures. Simple stuff that doesn't really get the limelight very often. But if you don't have any insulation in your loft, you can insulate the loft, right? You should have loft insulation.\n\nIf you have some gaps between your windows, you should be draft-proofing those windows. There's a lot of easy stuff that can be done to reduce demand and make properties more efficient, more comfortable. That's not sexy. It's not like the hydrogen versus heat pump discussion, but I think we need to keep focusing also on that, because these are low hanging fruits and there's still lots of them, and there's not a lot of people who talk about it these days. But I think it's still important that we, at the same time, once we have this big effort on decarbonizing the heat supply, we also try to really use heat more efficiently and smartly. We might want to go into that later, but I think smart and dynamic use of heat is going to be much more important in the future as well.\n\nMB: Well, two things to pull apart from this. The first one, efficiency types. There are many people who are deeply committed to efficiency first and negawatts who get really annoyed with me because my Short List of Climate Actions That Will Work does not include that. It starts with electrify everything, including heat pumps, and it doesn't include insulation. The reason is that if we electrify heat and the electricity is low carbon, then the primary concern is the cost of the heat, not about climate change. My focus is on climate change. Secondarily, there's a nuanced argument about reducing the increased demand of electricity by efficiency measures for a systemic thing, but that is secondary to electrifying heat, in my opinion.\n\nThe data point I tend to draw out on is a UK study. You've probably seen it, out of I think it was Cambridge, might have been Oxford. They looked at 55,000 UK homes which had received grants for insulation, for envelope retrofits from the early 2000s to 2020 or something. They looked at the ones that had gas heating, which is all, virtually all of them. And what they found was that after two years, virtually all gas reductions had been eliminated. After four years, people were using exactly the same amount of gas as they had been before.\n\nJR: I've actually reviewed that stuff on Twitter, I think, when it came out, and I'm not persuaded by the analysis, I must say. I certainly had some questions that were unanswered, because there is data that the government has of metered data. The UK government has data from energy use before a measure was being installed and after, and they have it over several years, and they show very clearly that there is an effect. The effect isn't as big as you would expect when you model it. When you sit down with the perfect model, this is what we expect because you have a rebound effect and you also have a performance gap. So the insulation technologies don't deliver 100% of what you might assume in the model. That data shows a reduction.\n\nWe also have longitudinal data of energy use at an aggregate level for the whole sector. You can look at the building sector and you see energy use and how it develops over time, and it's gone down substantially in the UK, and you can then do decomposition and analysis. So what's driving that, you know, is that because there are fewer people living in these homes, has the indoor temperature dropped? Are people working in the office and not at home? Like, what is the driver? When you look at that, efficiency shows up. So I think it's indeed a nuanced picture. I actually just did a paper with some colleagues at Oxford University and University College London on fabric first. Is it still the right approach? And our conclusion is, not really.\n\nI mean, for new buildings, If you construct a new building, you want to make sure that because the marginal cost is fairly minimal, and if you can build a new building that's more efficient, uses less energy, it's going to be cheaper to run. That makes the problem smaller. If you have an old stone building, thick walls, do you really want to insulate all of that? Does that make sense before you even think about the heating system? No. You can run a heat pump very efficiently or connect to district heating. If you have the right kind of heating system installed in the house, you can still achieve very high efficiency.\n\nI just never bought the argument that if you want to decarbonize your heating, you first need to do all these insulation measures, otherwise you can't do it. But if you want to just install another fossil system, your oil boiler breaks down, you put your new oil boiler in. That's fine. That's okay. You can go ahead and do that. You don't need to think about insulation. That's completely acceptable. But if you put a heat pump in, you have to do all of this stuff first, otherwise it's not perfect. It's not what we want you to do. I don't understand why. Because the carbon impact of putting a fossil fuel heating system in an inefficient building is way bigger than replacing a fossil fuel system in an inefficient building with a heat pump. You're saving way more carbon.\n\nIn fact, when you install the oil heating system, you're saving no carbon. Maybe a little bit, because the new system is a little bit more efficient. This is one of those, I think, topics that we've seen a shift, right. We had this sort of mantra of deep retrofits. That's the way to go. Fabric first. I think that's changing now because the electricity mix is getting cleaner and the carbon argument is no longer persuasive. You can decarbonize without any insulation. I think the question then is, well, what is the residual value of insulation? I think there still is one. Reduced running costs, the ability to pre cool and preheat, shift heat demand around comfort. So these arguments are still there, but they're different arguments.\n\nMB: Yeah, it's exactly the place I arrived at five years ago when I spent time looking at this, which is its fabric second. There's a Pareto argument for all of those types of things. You don't have to achieve 100% perfection passive home retrofit. 20% of the cost provides 80% of the benefits, and it balances the case for operational and capital cost exchanges. We ended up in the same place, even though we disagree on that UK study to a certain extent. To be clear, you've spent more time looking at it than I have, so you have a more nuanced view on it.\n\nThe second thing I'd like to pull in, though, is something we haven't talked about, which is cooling. One of the reasons that the name heat pump is problematic is that it's taking a while for the public to clue in, the general schmo who goes about their job and worries about reality TV, that heat pumps pump heat out as well as pumping heat in. They're like a refrigerator. The inside of your refrigerator is cold because a heat pump is pumping the heat out of the refrigerator, not because it's pumping cold in. Same thing with heat pumps.\n\nThe story I like to tell, the simplifying story, you have a gas furnace, you have central air, and you're paying maintenance on both of those, and you have different technicians that are coming on those, and you have different insurance concerns for those. It's really nice just to put in a single unit that replaces both of those. The total capital cost is lower because you're replacing two units with one, the maintenance costs are lower. If you don't have air conditioning today, getting a new gas furnace and insulation won't help you with that, but getting a heat pump will. We focus on the heat side, but the cooling side is critical. How many people was it in Europe that died in that heat wave three years ago, 61,000?\n\nJR: I don't have the numbers in front of me, but those numbers will be growing. We're going to see more heat waves and temperatures that were unheard of in Europe. The drive to cooling is already happening. In the US, I think something like 95% plus of all buildings have air con. In Europe, I think it's less than 5%. Certainly in residential buildings. Commercial buildings have more because they often have reversible heat pumps, actually for heating and cooling, but cooling demand will go up. It can go up in a kind of really unmanaged fashion. So people go on Amazon, buy a mobile air conditioning system for a specific room. That's not a great way to go about this.\n\nIdeally, you think, okay, we're gonna need cooling every year or every other year. So you may as well have a heating system and cooling system that's integrated that does both. That's one of the upsides of having cooling. I would be surprised if in ten years' time, this wasn't more on people's minds. When they think about the next system they want, might not even be about, oh, will I pay more money or less money running this system? But really I want cooling, I want the comfort, and I'm willing to pay extra for that. I think we're going to see that happening increasingly where people will look at cooling, and that's an opportunity, in a way, to also then talk about the heating at the same time.\n\nIn the US, I know this is a conversation that the installers of heat pumps often have with their customers, where they say, look, you've got an old cooling system here, that air con system that needs to be replaced. You also have the furnace. How about we get rid of your heating system and just have one system that's going to, for exactly the reasons you've outlined, cheaper to operate and cheaper to install. You're actually saving money. But this is, I think, one of the arguments being made.\n\nMB: There's also a health argument. Back to that 61,000. I live in a jurisdiction in British Columbia, in the lower mainland. It was incredibly temperate. It was rare to get below freezing. It was rare to get above 25 degrees Celsius. That was the range that British Columbia exists in. The average winter day has a high of seven degrees Celsius, which is something in Fahrenheit American listeners can go look up. That range is interesting. Two or three years ago we had over 900 deaths in the lower part of British Columbia, during the heat dome over the region. It hit 37 degrees in the area surrounding my condo building.\n\nAnd like Europe, British Columbia, Lower Mainland buildings, British Columbia buildings had no air conditioning. We didn't need it. It just wasn't a requirement. We had heat. Unlike New Zealand, which doesn't have heat in any of its buildings, which is really weird. I was down there last year, and I was like, where's the thermostat? There is no thermostat. They have a space heater in the closet that they provide. But now what's happening in Vancouver is going to be happening everywhere because the health effects epidemiologically start appearing when nighttime temperatures do not get below 20 degrees Celsius for two to three nights. People start dying. The lower socioeconomic classes who do not have the luxury of going outside, the people in the upper stories of lower multi-unit residential rental buildings, they start seeing extreme heat, and they start seeing the challenges of that.\n\nNow, Vancouver has mandated that as of 2025, all new residential units must have air conditioning. And they must be EV-ready as well, which is nice, that's good, but air conditioning will save people's lives. And so we are starting to see a really big transition. I'm leading a retrofitting of our multi-unit residential building for heat pumps right now. All my baseboard heaters are gone, and I have gaping holes in my drywall. But I have air conditioning and cheaper heating. Cooling is that secondary factor, and just replacing the heat, if you just stop at replacing the heat, you miss the advantage. That simplification of a heat pump for both heating and cooling and heat pumps. I'm just going to say this. Heat pumps are generally more efficient than the air conditioners they replace because the technology has moved on. The coefficient of performance is better than the stuff they're replacing.\n\nJR: Oh, huge differences. I mean, that's when you look at, you, can some people track this, right? You can see in history how the efficiency improves with increased deployment. You have that innovation. In Switzerland, for example, there's a longitudinal study going back, I think, to the 1970s, and they've done a lot of ground source heat pumps and also air source heat pumps. You can see how that efficiency getting better over time, because the technology is getting better, the installation that's also important is getting better. The installers figure out how to install these technologies in a way that delivers higher efficiency.\n\nWhen people have a really poor experience with heat pumps, it's often down to a very bad install. If you have an installer who doesn't really know what he or she is doing and the system is installed badly, you end up with a really inefficient system. Then often people turn to social media and they say, my heat pump is terrible. It doesn't work, it's super expensive. A journalist will pick that up, write a story about it. The main reason why it's not working is because the person who installed it didn't do a good job.\n\nThen we look at the top installs. There's now a great website, I think it's heatpumpmonitor.org or something for the UK, where you can see like there's some real nerdy stuff going on, but people basically do it. They share the API for the data of the heat pump with that platform. You can see a ranking of who has the most efficient system and you can see who installed it, what kind of model is it? But you can see these vast differences in efficiency. They could be twice or three times as efficient if installed well. This is a really significant factor, but just on the cooling piece, because I think it's fascinating and it's overlooked.\n\nWe're going to run into a lot of problems, not so much in southern Europe, perhaps because the buildings are constructed in a way to deal with quite extreme heat. They have been built already, hundreds of years ago in a way, to deal with heat, but inner cities, take Paris, for example. A colleague of mine lives in Paris, in an old building on the fifth floor. During the heat wave, I asked him what the temperature was at night. He said, oh, it never got below 25 degrees Centigrade. Try to sleep at 25 degrees Centigrade. I mean, I can't sleep. It's too hot. It's awful. So this is going to become a huge thing, and I think no one is really yet paying enough attention to it. So, yeah, this could be a huge challenge. But at the same time, as you said, Michael, it could be an opportunity to use it for accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels used for heating.\n\nMB: The nice thing about summer cooling is you can time-shift excess solar to nighttime cooling much more easily than you can time-shift summertime solar to winter heating. There is a better match.\n\nJR: Right, the match with solar and cooling. Indeed. It's only the evening hours, but that's less of a problem in Europe. But I think if you're near the equator, for example, and you need cooling after dark and it's still hot. Right. That's kind of where solar doesn't really help you anymore. You can do some pre-cooling, but I think that's what we're seeing in California, right, where we have that evening ramp up, where people want air con, they're home, they want it nice and cool, but the solar is dropping off. Then all these batteries are now kicking in. That's a fascinating story. I think cooling almost warrants its own episode on this podcast at some point, it seems.\n\nMB: I think it's time to really put a few more nails in the coffin of hydrogen for domestic and commercial heat. You've been publishing, it feels like every three months, a new meta analysis of independent studies of the question of hydrogen versus its alternatives. Would you like to tell us about when you started that process and what the numbers are up to now and what the findings are?\n\nJR: Very happy to. Where do I start? When I first started to look at decarbonization of heating, it was perhaps five or six years ago when I wrote the first paper, 2019, I think it was. I wrote the first paper on what do we do with heating? And I came to this really not wanting to get involved in the technology discussion too much. I was more interested in what is workable, what can we scale. I don't want to be in this kind of polarized discussion that I was seeing taking place. But I increasingly realized that unless we resolve this discussion, we can't move on.\n\nBecause every time you say, oh, we should have a policy that's supporting the uptake of heat pumps or district heating, someone will say, no, no, hydrogen is going to come along, that's a waste of public money, or that's a poor policy decision. So it was really holding back the progress that I thought we would need to make. So then my next step was, okay, let's look at the evidence. Let's look at the scientific evidence and not the evidence that's been manufactured, paid for, because there's a lot of studies that you can find and that will say hydrogen is the best way to decarbonize heating. And when you look at who's funded that work, it's companies with vested interests.\n\nYou also find lots of studies, by the way, that will say heat pumps are the solutions, district heating is a solution, bioenergy is a solution funded by the companies that sell these products, these technologies. Again, of course they would say that, otherwise they wouldn't publish these studies, which they paid for. The studies that they paid for that don't arrive at that conclusion, they wouldn't publish. I'm not saying these studies are wrong, I'm just saying we have to take them with a pinch of salt and be cautious about them. So I was then concluding, let's look at just the independent studies not funded by industry at all, whether that's the electric utilities, the heat pump companies, the gas boiler manufacturers, the gas network operators.\n\nNone of those studies are included in what I started doing as my first review on LinkedIn. Actually, I think it was only ten studies, and I put them together in a table and it didn't look particularly pretty. Then people were asking me for more detail and they were encouraging me to write this up, and they were sending me stuff as well. I mean, that's like, oh, have you looked at this? Have you looked at that? I then decided, actually, it's time to do a meta analysis.\n\nMB: Let's talk about the pyramid of evidence and where meta analyses sit on the pyramid of evidence.\n\nJR: Is it worth describing what a meta analysis is, what that entails?\n\nMB: Let's start with what a meta analysis isn't. I mean, at the bottom you've got expert opinion and people refer to me and I just keep saying to them, here's the pyramid of evidence. Here's what I'm saying. For the most part, it's expert opinion. So then you get controlled case studies, you've got controlled trials with control groups, and then you've kind of got something else. But then you get to meta analyses at the top of the pyramid of evidence.\n\nThis is where, let me paraphrase, because I've been involved in a couple kind of peripherally, this is where people, a group of people, or an individual establishes criteria for inclusion of high quality evidence, makes a judgment about the evidence, says this is not high quality enough to be reliable, and then assesses the results across all of the reliable pieces of evidence of scientific papers that other people have done to assert what the best current view of common reality is. The IPCC reports are a meta analysis of all climate change and climate impact efforts. It is the biggest, most expensive, most long running meta analysis going. Jan is doing a small version of that for heating around hydrogen and heat pumps. So Jan, massively credible, top of the pyramid of evidence, you're doing it. Tell us what the results are.\n\nJR: In the first meta analysis that I did, I had just above 30 different studies that I identified that were independent, that were looking at using hydrogen for heating in buildings, and what the economics of that would be. The cost, the consumer, the system cost. How feasible is that? They didn't all answer the same question. They looked at different aspects of hydrogen for heating. None of those studies that I found at the time, all of which are independent, that was for me, was a cut-off, like any non-independent study, was not included in that. None of them suggest that hydrogen for heating would be a scalable solution, that would be cheaper, more efficient, less costly, with lower systems cost.\n\nIn fact, there was agreement that hydrogen is going to cost consumers more, is going to have higher energy system cost, and also the limited evidence that there is, has higher environmental impacts because of the increased use of resources required to produce the hydrogen in the first place. That is, electricity use and the resources required to build out renewable energy for that. That was the first piece of it. In the aftermath, there was a multitude of more studies getting published. I did an update a year and a bit after that. That was published in December last year, in December 2023, and that was now at 54 studies. Again, similar picture, very similar picture.\n\nThere was only one study in there that was kind of sitting on the fence. They were saying hydrogen isn't going to be cheaper, but it's also not necessarily going to be more expensive. We don't know the uncertainties, but it didn't come out saying hydrogen is a great solution. Since then we had another, I think, five studies. We're now at 59 studies. I think that we're not quite at 60 yet. The picture hasn't changed. I have people on LinkedIn in particular, when I published this and put the paper out, attacking me and saying, you are biased, you know, you haven't included all of the studies.\n\nI said, send me any studies that I haven't included because what I have done is just to explain how you actually go about, yeah, there's Web of Science, which is a database for scientific papers, Scopus, another database for scientific papers, Google Scholar, that's a little less reliable because it's more wide-ranging. But I've used all of the usual platforms. You define your search terms, you screen all of the papers. I've screened thousands of papers, filtered out the ones that are relevant, and then you do the analysis. Right. I couldn't find any other papers, so I said, please, if I missed something, which is possible, because sometimes the search terms that you've used don't get you to all of the papers, that can happen. But no one could send me anything.\n\nThere was one guy who sent me a paper that was funded by a gas network company, or this was funded by the boiler association. I'm not going to include that. I still stand by the same conclusion, which is that the independent evidence is very conclusive that hydrogen for heating is going to be more expensive for consumers, has higher system costs, and is unlikely to play a significant role. I think that is a statement based on the evidence. This made it into different parliamentary proceedings not just in Europe, and it's been quoted in regulatory proceedings also in the US, I think also in Canada, because people are ultimately interested in what the evidence says and regulators are very interested in that question. Policymakers who are sensible will look at that and, yeah.\n\nHas it changed the debate? I've been told it has, because it's kind of provided that clarity, which I think when I started out where it wasn't clear. Where is this debate? Like, are you pro hydrogen or pro heat pumps? It seemed like a silly debate with no evidence base behind it. Now there is an evidence base and hopefully that will have supported that clarity that we needed to see to move forward.\n\nMB: Three or four things about this. One is part of what I spend my time doing, people point me at DNV reports on hydrogen pipelines from offshore hydrogen generation at wind farms, or, you know, other reports that are funded by trucking lobbies. I look at them and they're often credible organizations. DNV is a very credible organization, a northern European quality assurance and standards organization. It's responsible for safety of a lot of infrastructure. McKinsey is a blue chip consulting firm. Roland Berger out of Germany is another one.\n\nBut the thing is, I used to work in consulting firms, and I know how they work, and I know how consulting reports are written. A client comes and says, I need this outcome, and the consultant goes, how does it need to be framed? What do we need to do? What conditions do we need to put on it? How much are you willing to pay me for it? And they hold their noses in many cases, or they're biased themselves and do the study and find the results the client wants. And they have a strong impetus for this, because consulting firms have to manage their bench. They have people sitting on the bench not doing anything, who are not making money for the company, resources with fixed costs. And if there's no revenue covering those costs, the company is losing money. I look at some of these reports, and then I look at the provenance of some of the authors and I go, okay, those three people were definitely sitting on the bench and the lead is the hydrogen lead for the company.\n\nThat's a problem. One, we get weak reports that are bought and paid for results. But then the organizations that are buying those reports are also paying PR firms to amplify those results, which no scientific paper gets. It's like the DNV paper, for example, which found that green hydrogen manufactured offshore and piped into Europe would be cheaper than anything else. Guess who funded it? The European Gas Pipeline association. It's very clear. And they got the oil and gas side of DNV to do that. I won't tell tales out of court, but I've heard a bit about the internal furor about that. It was not well received in all of DNV.\n\nWe have this interesting conundrum where organizations, legacy organizations who are threatened, like every gas utility in the world, have a tremendous amount of money. Existing lobbying groups clearly see the writing on the wall, and it doesn't say, your business is golden, and you'll have 4% compounded annual growth rates for the next hundred years. Here's a bottle of Cristal and a cigar. Let's go and have a smoke. It doesn't say that. Says quite the opposite, but unless they can put hydrogen into those pipelines, they won't exist.\n\nYou're undoubtedly familiar with RISE, the Swedish Research Institute. I participated in a freight trucking decarbonization study for Europe with RISE over the past eight months or so. One of the questions I was discussing with the lead researcher, Jakob Rogstadius, was, will there be a hydrogen gas distribution network in Europe? I said, no, look at Jan's study. If there's no use for hydrogen for heating buildings, there's no gas distribution retail network, because that's what the primary use is. There's no way to pay for it. There'll be an industrial network, potentially, that's probably already about as big as it's going to be, but no retail network. The entire gas utility industry is facing the utility death spiral. That means they have to set up a strategic schedule to shut down their distribution, their gas distribution system, sub isolation network by sub isolation network, strategically, and help the neighborhoods to get heat pumps or hooked up to district heating. You know, that's just what it is.\n\nJR: Actually, Michael, we're actually having a paper coming out very soon on this very subject, because what we're seeing now is that this is already happening, right? In France, president of the regulator, last year, when the grid fees for the gas network went up, said, this is happening because we see less volume of gas being piped through and fewer customers. So if you have the same cost of operating the gas grid and you have a smaller number of customers and less volume, well, guess what? Your cost per customer, in particular, kilowatt-hour, or BTU, I think, as you would call it, probably.\n\nMB: I'd call it a gigajoule personally.\n\nJR: But that goes up, right? And this is only very modest. But the projections, and we've looked at projections in our paper, in some cases, the projections are for the UK, the regulator, things could be going up by ten times. So by 2050, if you do nothing, if you just say, we're not going to do anything, and if you let the decarbonization journey continue and people are switching away from the gas grid, the remaining gas customers will have to pay more and more for remaining connected to the gas grid, which then in turn drives them to consider other options. Because the economic case for switching away from the gas grid, it becomes ever greater. The incentive to move away is increasing, which then in turn drives again more of that death spiral.\n\nWhat we are really trying to figure out is how can you, rather than just letting this happen, how can you manage this, how can you make sure this is not happening in an unregulated fashion, which is actually in the interests, I would argue, of the gas network companies and of the investors that want to get their money back. An orderly regulatory framework that makes sure we have a transition that is managed is preferable to a situation where it's chaotic and people are defecting the network at rapid pace. There's no plan for how to deal with the decommissioning costs, which are also not insignificant. I mean, it's not that, it's you just leave the gas network in the ground and then you walk away. You have to make it safe. And there's a cost associated with that.\n\nYou need to disconnect people from the network. But again, there's a cost associated with that. So we're going to spell out in more detail what we think that can look like, that framework, how it can be done. But this is becoming, I think, in the next decade, I think this will be one of the number one topics in the energy discussion. There's no doubt. I think the last sort of ten years, and just before that, it was all about getting out of coal and decarbonizing the power sector. We're now moving towards getting out of fossil gas and especially the distribution grid. We're just getting into the discussion now.\n\nIn countries like Germany, where the government decided that there's going to be a requirement for municipalities now to put forward plans for how they decarbonize their building stock, their heating system, they can't just say, oh, we're going to have hydrogen in 2030 or 2035, and it's going to be fine. No, the regulator will very carefully check whether that's a realistic proposition. So if your local gas grid operator says, we're going to continue, we're going to convert our network to hydrogen, unless they have a really credible plan to do that, the regulator will say, we don't believe that, you know, that's not going to happen. And we will see more and more of that where at the city level, decisions will be made to decommission parts of the gas grid in stages. Not going to happen all in one go.\n\nIt's happening already in Switzerland, in Basel, in Wintertour, for example, we're seeing municipalities taking steps towards that. I think we're going to see more of that, whether we like it or not. Yeah, I don't think this is stoppable. It's going to happen, but I think if it happens, we should deal with it in a way that is orderly and managed, rather than having a chaotic decommissioning approach.\n\nMB: The proof point I point to is Utrecht, which has been going down this path for five years in the Netherlands municipality in the region of 470,000 people or so. They've actually done the study. They say, here's the list of sub-isolation networks. A sub-isolation network is where you can turn off a single valve and you've isolated a bunch of homes or buildings. They're down at that level. They have a schedule through 2045 or so of all the shutdowns. They've already started the process, they've communicated it to everybody, and they've established assistance programs for transition. The way I always say it is, the gas utilities won't do this on their own. Governments, through the regulatory agencies, have to force this upon them because they're not set up to shut themselves down. It's just the nature of the beast.\n\nJR: I think the risk is that especially low income customers, they might be tenants, there might be people who have any disposable income. They're not going to be the ones who switch away from the gas grid first. They're going to be the ones who switch last or not at all, and they'll be stuck on the system that will become more and more expensive. There's a real equity issue there that needs to be addressed head on, because who's buying heat pumps? It tends to be better educated, wealthier people right now. If that continues, there's a real risk that the poorest people who are least able to afford it will be the one stuck with an expensive gas grid.\n\nThat is not right, and that's not fair. It's not the right thing to do. That's why we need to, as you say, get regulation to deal with that, rather than leaving it to the operators of the gas grid. Actually, I think it's in their interest, too. If they can depreciate their assets more quickly, have regulation that allows them to orderly decommission the gas grid while still maintaining a profit as they do that. I think that's in their interests, too. But of course, right now we're still seeing that battle of will we even have to do that? But I think that battle is increasingly getting lost. I mean, the trials for hydrogen for heating in the UK, three of those have been canceled or stalled. So it didn't happen in two cases because of local protests.\n\nIn the third case was supposed to be a hydrogen town. The government didn't even proceed with looking at which town would it be and the detailed plans for that. This is not a viable option going forward. So if that's not happening, we got to talk about the future of the gas grid. So that, again, you have another topic for another episode. Michael, what to do with the gas grids if the gas use declines. Our paper should come out very soon and has much more detail on what we think that could look like.\n\nMB: Michael Liebreich asked me about this a couple of years ago when we were chatting, and I said, well, obviously this is the strategic approach, and I published on it then. But, you know, I at best get into gray literature. Some of my pieces. People say, we'd like to publish this in our peer reviewed journal. I say, can you make me not have to suffer the peer review process too much? People mistake me for an academic, but I'm not an academic. I'm just a nerd who needs to know, and I do the level of granularity required to satisfy myself, which seems to be the level necessary to satisfy a lot of people.\n\nWe're a bit over an hour and a half in. This has been amazing. Thank you so much. But I always leave an opportunity at the end for just that open-ended thing. Whatever you feel you want to say to the audience that's listening, who's persisted through this kind of nerdy discussion of policy, sausage-making alternatives for heat, what thoughts would you leave them?\n\nJR: Well, I think people often make this all look like it's all too difficult. We're not going to get there. This is too hard. It's too difficult and we shouldn't do it because it's hard. I really think that's a mistake. We have heard the same arguments about other technologies that are now widespread. Yeah, people have said the same thing about EVs. We are never going to have electric vehicles. This is never going to work. We're never going to have renewables play any significant role. The German utilities actually funded adverts in the early 1990s, saying renewables could only ever contribute something like 4% in the long run to electricity generation. Last time I checked in Germany, it was more than 50% of renewable electricity. So we see history repeat itself just on a different subject.\n\nNow it's about heating and using fossil gas and buildings and the gas grid. I have no reason to believe that we're going to see just the same that we have seen with electric vehicles, with the power system. It's going to be a different journey, of course, because it's different technologies, different actors. But overall, the story will be very similar. Lots of skepticism, lots of distractions. But in the end, we are moving ahead with this, and there's going to be, yeah, there's going to be bumps in the road. Of course we make mistakes, but ultimately I'm an optimist. I believe we're going to see innovators. They're seeking this opportunity. We're seeing that now. We're seeing private equity moving into this space, funding innovation, new company startups spotting inefficiencies in the market. Things are moving very fast.\n\nSo if we have the same conversation in five or ten years, things would have changed dramatically. So I think we are in a good position now to move forward after spending maybe too much time discussing all the things that maybe should not be in the mix. And I hope that I can focus more of my energy on what needs to happen rather than what maybe shouldn't happen in the future.\n\nMB: Personally I would be delighted to not have to write another debunking hydrogen article again about something stupid where hydrogen is clearly not an option. Jan, great pleasure to have you with me. Thank you for your time today.\n\nJR: Thanks for having me. Great talking to you, Michael.\n\nMB: I'm Michael Barnard of Redefining Energy Tech.

Currently this ranking system is being developed by California's Environmental Protection Agency and is planned to be launched in 2025 as the nation's first extreme heat wave ranking system.\n\nAccording to the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA), heat is the state's deadliest climate-driven hazard. The goal of the CalHeat Score system is to forecast coming heat waves, help people prepare and plan for extreme heat events and provide information about local resources by making the information accessible and digestible on a community level.\n\nThis system will include an interactive heat risk map for communities across the state. It will also be an important tool in helping the state achieve its goal of creating local health-protective thresholds of extreme heat by accounting for factors of both regional and local climates depending on the season and duration of extreme heat. It will also track where the most vulnerable populations reside. Vulnerable populations include children and elderly people, in addition to those with certain health conditions.\n\nThe CalHeat Score was born from the California Department of Insurance's (CDI) Climate Insurance Workgroup 2021 recommendation to build a system to rank heat waves in an effort to better communicate the deadly risks of rising heat to Californians. It will also aid residents in preparing for projected heat waves, \"similar to how tropical storms and hurricanes are described by 'category' level,\" states the CalEPA website.\n\nAssembly Bill No. 2238 brought these recommendation to fruition by requiring CalEPA to develop an extreme heat ranking system and the Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency Program (ICARP) to disseminate information to communities and local leaders.\n\nThe bill was jointly authored by Assemblymembers Luz Rivas, Eduardo Garcia, and former Assemblymember Cristina Garcia. The map is being developed in coordination with the Department of Insurance and the Integrated Climate Adaptation and Resiliency program in the Governor's Office of Planning and Research.\n\nThe CalHeat score system will be finalized by January 1, 2025.", "source": {"uri": "blackvoicenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Black Voice News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aryana_noroozi@blackvoicenews.com", "name": "Aryana Noroozi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luz_Rivas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luz Rivas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Garcia_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Garcia (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Garcia_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristina Garcia (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California State Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Practices_and_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Practices and Systems", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/blackvoicenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1280x721_voice_CA_heatwave.png?fit=1280%2C721&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Their work exposes them to various hazards, like high ambient temperatures and radiant heat from furnaces. These workers operate in poorly ventilated home-based industries and small factories, classified under the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) category.\n\nIn the state of Uttar Pradesh, where Kannauj is located, the MSME sector employs about 11 million workers, while across India, the sector employs over 123 million people, accounting for 20 per cent of the entire workforce. While not all MSMEs engage in extreme heat-related activities, most MSME employees are exposed to heat hazards due to the informal nature of their work.\n\nAvikal Somvanshi, head of the Urban Lab programme at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), says: \"Anyone working in medium and small-scale industries, factories, which are not insulated, or do not have any kind of air conditioning or even fans to cool people down are highly vulnerable to heat.\" He notes that these buildings are cramped without ventilation, with tin roofs that fail to block out the heat, especially during extreme temperatures such as those experienced in May and June.\n\nIn 2024, India experienced one of its longest-ever heatwaves. Uttar Pradesh saw 20 heatwave days between March 1 to June 9. Media reports indicate that between March 1 and June 18, approximately 110 people died from heat stroke, with over 40,000 suspected cases reported. Although data related to work-related illness or deaths due to heat is unavailable, reports suggest fatalities in North Indian states like Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nOccupational safety and health used to fall under the Factories Act, 1948, which required factories to ensure \"adequate ventilation by the circulation of fresh air\" and maintain \"such a temperature as will secure to workers therein reasonable conditions of comfort and prevent injury to health\". In 2020, India consolidated 13 central laws on workers' safety into the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020.\n\nThe new code mentions managing temperatures only in the context of dock workers. Moreover, as noted by the think tank PRS Legislative Research, \"The 2020 bill empowers the state government to exempt any new factory from the provisions of the Code in order to create more economic activity and employment.\" This exemption has been retained in the act.\n\nOther government institutions, such as the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), also ignore the impact of rising heat on industry, focussing only on individuals, with only advisory guidelines for heatwaves. The Ministry of Labour and Employment, responsible for overseeing worker safety, is restricted in its actions.\n\nNavneet Shrivastav, labour enforcement officer at the Kannauj labour department, says, \"The district authority has released directions for putting work on hold during the day time. We are seeing a decline in working hours especially during peak heat time (12 PM-3 PM).\" He adds, \"We cannot ask small factories to stop work or inspect the workplace directly without any complaint by workers to the commission.\"\n\nIn 2019, the NDMA published its national guidelines on heatwaves to protect the public from extreme heat. These guidelines aim to help public officials develop their own heatwave action plans across India's cities and towns.\n\nDuring heatwaves, the labour department, state disaster management authorities (SDMAs), the India Meteorological Department and other state authorities release advisories and Heat Action Plan (HAPs) for the general public and workers.\n\nAravind Unni, a policy researcher on heat and informal workers with the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), highlights that these HAPs and advisories are \"general\" in nature. \"Our HAPs and heat warnings never go into details of workers, population groups, or marginalised groups,\" he says.\n\nUnni suggests that district administration or municipal authorities could enhance HAPs by providing specific advisories for various demographics, such as perfume makers, brick kiln workers and textile workers, who experience heat in different workplace contexts. This tailored approach could improve the effectiveness of heat-related advisories.\n\nAnother missing element in the HAPs and guidelines is the consideration of humid heat. While humans can tolerate 54\u02daC of dry heat, studies show that, in humid conditions, \"35\u00b0C marks the heat stress tolerance limit\". Since MSMEs are poorly ventilated and often cramped, humidity becomes more difficult to tolerate for workers, especially during the monsoon season.\n\nIn early July, Dialogue Earth visited a few small bakeries in Delhi. Mohd Rizwan, who works alongside a furnace fuelled by liquified petroleum gas used for baking bread, says, \"It is very bad here during summers, especially when the monsoon arrives. One starts feeling very hot and dizzy during summer. It often leads to vomiting.\"", "source": {"uri": "eco-business.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eco-Business"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here's what to know", "body": "By Suhauna Hussain, Los Angeles Times The Tribune Content Agency\n\nMore than a million workers laboring in warehouses, kitchens, laundry rooms and other hot indoor settings across California are now protected by new safety measures that went into effect on Tuesday.\n\nThe indoor heat illness prevention rule, adopted by the standards board at the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health last month, regulates indoor workplaces that reach or surpass 82 degrees.\n\nAfter years of delays, labor leaders celebrated the implementation of the rule. They had pressed in recent weeks for a mandated legal review of the rule to be expedited in order to get the protections in place as early on in the summer as possible.\n\n\"[W]e are relieved that the indoor heat protections are now finally in effect in California,\" said Lorena Gonzalez, head of the California Labor Federation, in a statement Wednesday. \"This long-overdue victory for workers cannot be overstated; these protections from extreme heat will save countless lives.\"\n\nThe new safety measures require employers to provide water, cooling areas and monitoring of workers for signs of heat illness whenever indoor workplace temperatures reach or surpass 82 degrees.\n\nIf temperatures climb to 87 degrees, or workers are required to work near hot equipment, employers must cool the work site. If doing so is not feasible, they must allow for more breaks, rotate workers out of hot environments and make other adjustments.\n\nDesignated cool-down areas are supposed to be as close as possible to where employees are working, and large enough that workers can sit normally without touching each other. They must be blocked from direct sunlight and shielded from heat sources, with adequate ventilation and cooling.\n\nDrinking water must be available in multiple locations and should be \"fresh, pure, suitably cool, and provided to workers free of charge,\" the new rule says.\n\nIn guidance Cal/OSHA officials issued to employers, supervisors are advised to taste the water and pour it on their skin to check that it is adequate.\n\nEmployers should remind and encourage workers to drink water frequently in training sessions as well as throughout the work day, as workers \"may not feel how urgently their bodies need water,\" according to Cal/OSHA guidance.\n\nUnder the new rule, employers are required to allow workers to take cool-down rests if they feel they need to protect themselves from overheating.\n\n\"Waiting until symptoms appear before taking a cool-down rest may be too late,\" Cal/OSHA guidance says.\n\nThe indoor heat standard applies to most workplaces. The state estimates the new rule will apply to about 1.4 million people who work indoors in conditions that can easily become exposed to extreme heat. Industries anticipated to be most affected include warehouses, manufacturing and restaurants.\n\nThe indoor heat rule does not apply to correctional staff or inmate workers in prisons, local detention facilities, and juvenile facilities.\n\nThe Department of Corrections and Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration are in the process of consulting with worker advocates to create a separate indoor heat rule for these facilities. It is unclear how long it will take to develop and implement those protections.\n\nThe newly implemented rule also does not apply to employees who are working remotely from places not under the control of their employer.\n\nWhat happens if an employer doesn't follow the heat rule?\n\nWorkers who believe their workplaces are not adequately protecting them from extreme heat conditions can file a complaint with Cal/OSHA online or by calling (833) 579-0927.\n\nIt's possible, however, that enforcement will be slow. California agencies responsible for enforcing labor laws have also been beset by inadequate staffing and claims of ineffectiveness.\n\nCal/OSHA is grappling with a 38% job vacancy rate and faced sharp criticism at a February hearing of the Assembly Committee on Labor and Employment, where farm workers testified that they'd been exposed to extreme heat and pesticides on the job.\n\n\"We will continue pushing Cal/OSHA to prioritize enforcement so that bad employers can't get away with subjecting workers to life-threatening working conditions from indoor heat exposure,\" said Gonzalez, the California Labor Federation president, in her Wednesday statement.\n\nAre there similar protections at the federal level?\n\nCalifornia in 2006 became the first state in the nation to establish permanent heat protections for outdoor workers and is among just a handful of states that have adopted indoor heat regulations.\n\nThere is no similar standard at the federal level, although the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration this monthreleased details of its proposed rule to protect indoor and outdoor workers from high temperatures. The move is a major step forward, though the rule must receive feedback, among other steps, and likely will not be finalized for a while.\n\nLouis Blumberg, a senior climate policy advisor at Climate Resolve, said California's move to finally adopt the indoor heat standard means that it \"automatically becomes a model, or at least a floor for federal agencies to consider and adopt.\"\n\n\"This is very important as a labor issue. But it's bigger than that. It's an important step toward building climate resilience on a society-wide basis,\" Blumberg said.\n\nA federal standard would be particularly significant in states such as Florida and Texas - which have passed laws blocking cities or employers from establishing heat rules.", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "suhauna_hussain@bradenton.com", "name": "Suhauna Hussain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Division_of_Occupational_Safety_and_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California Division of Occupational Safety and Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corrections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ventilation (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remote work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occupational Safety and Health Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Government Agencies", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Government Agencies", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/7y62qz/picture290413009/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/abc73169-549c-4542-81b2-3988fb6ab3ef", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

California agencies responsible for enforcing labor laws have also been beset by inadequate staffing and claims of ineffectiveness.\n\nCal/OSHA is grappling with a 38% job vacancy rate and faced sharp criticism at a February hearing of the Assembly Committee on Labor and Employment, where farm workers testified that they'd been exposed to extreme heat and pesticides on the job.\n\n\"We will continue pushing Cal/OSHA to prioritize enforcement so that bad employers can't get away with subjecting workers to life-threatening working conditions from indoor heat exposure,\" said Gonzalez, the California Labor Federation president, in her Wednesday statement.\n\nCalifornia in 2006 became the first state in the nation to establish permanent heat protections for outdoor workers and is among just a handful of states that have adopted indoor heat regulations.\n\nThere is no similar standard at the federal level, although the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration this month released details of its proposed rule to protect indoor and outdoor workers from high temperatures. The move is a major step forward, though the rule must receive feedback, among other steps, and likely will not be finalized for a while.\n\nLouis Blumberg, a senior climate policy advisor at Climate Resolve, said California's move to finally adopt the indoor heat standard means that it \"automatically becomes a model, or at least a floor for federal agencies to consider and adopt.\"\n\n\"This is very important as a labor issue. But it's bigger than that. It's an important step toward building climate resilience on a society-wide basis,\" Blumberg said.\n\nA federal standard would be particularly significant in states such as Florida and Texas -- which have passed laws blocking cities or employers from establishing heat rules.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Division_of_Occupational_Safety_and_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California Division of Occupational Safety and Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventilation_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ventilation (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remote work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occupational Safety and Health Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corrections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a57bacf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6468x3638+0+337/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F02%2Fcf%2F2fb72e39406c987eb850230f329b%2Fla-photos-freelance-contract-479714-la-fi-virtual-kitchens03-ptf.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

The leadership of those with the greatest capabilities and capacities is essential. Countries must phase out fossil fuels - fast and fairly.\"\n\nRelated: Canada is proposing to lead on climate - but it's doubling down on oil\n\nThe remarks come a day after the Guardian revealed how a surge in fresh oil and gas exploration in 2024 threatens to unleash nearly 12bn tonnes of planet-heating gases, around the annual emissions of China, over the lifetime of the new drilling projects. Wealthy countries, such as the US and the UK, with a low economic dependence on fossil fuels have led this charge, handing out a record 825 oil and gas licenses last year.\n\nGuterres said the world's wealthiest countries need to scrap fossil fuel subsidies, end new coal projects and support developing, vulnerable countries from climate impacts such as heatwaves, flooding and droughts. \"Leaders across the board must wake up and step up,\" the secretary general said.\n\nThe mounting toll of the climate crisis has been brought into focus this week, with the record for the highest daily average global temperature falling on Sunday, and then again on Monday. The world has experienced 13 consecutive months of record heat, with this year expected to beat the annual temperature record, set just in 2023.\n\nAlready this summer, severe heatwaves have swept the US, Europe and Japan, while at least 1,300 people died making the annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe UN on Thursday released a new report calling for countries to do more to protect people from extreme heat, pointing to data showing that about 489,000 people died each year from 2000 to 2019 from heat-related deaths, nearly half of them in Asia and a third occurring in Europe. New data from the International Labour Organization shows that more than 70% of the global workforce, approximately 2.4 billion people, are now at risk from extreme heat.\n\nGuterres urged governments to increase access to low-carbon cooling, redesign cities to cope with extreme heat, protect vulnerable people - such as outdoor workers, pregnant women, children and elderly and disabled people - and build up early-warning systems to prepare for deadly heatwaves.\n\n\"Extreme heat amplifies inequality, inflames food insecurity and pushes people further into poverty,\" he said. \"If there is one thing that unites our divided world, it's that we're all increasingly feeling the heat. Earth is becoming hotter and more dangerous for everyone, everywhere.\"\n\nRelated: 'This used to be a beautiful place': how the US became the world's biggest fossil fuel state\n\nGuterres added: \"To tackle all these symptoms, we need to fight the disease. The disease is the madness of incinerating our only home. The disease is the addiction to fossil fuels. The disease is climate inaction.\"\n\nWealthy countries have roundly defended their climate credentials, although there is a growing recognition that expanding oil and gas production is incompatible with a scenario in which the world manages to limit dangerous global heating.\n\nEnergy security, as well as the imperative to deal with the climate crisis, demands countries like the UK \"get off fossil fuels\", Ed Miliband, the UK's secretary of state for energy security and net zero, told the BBC on Thursday.\n\n\"You look around thew world, this is the new logic that developing countries, developed countries are recognizing,\" he said. \"Unless we drive for clean energy we are exposed - we are going to end that exposure.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

In the past, when a given area set some particular mark, they could usually enjoy it for a bit before seeing the record fall again. Not so much anymore.\n\nAccording to preliminary data from the E.U.'s Copernicus Climate Change Service, the global average temperature has never been higher than those consecutive days. After more than a year straight of record-warm months, in the historically hottest month of the year, we all, collectively, just experienced the pinnacle of warming so far.\n\nOf course, individuals don't experience global averages. Instead, we get to enjoy the extreme heat waves and record-breaking days (and nights) that contribute to those smoothed out totals. Fairbanks, Alaska, was expected to possibly hit 90 degrees F this week. Spain has already sweltered through two extended heat waves this summer, and temperatures early next week could approach 115 degrees in some places. Eastern Europe is suffering through triple-digit heat as well; in Serbia, where Belgrade reached 104 degrees recently, the heat and drought led Lake Rusanda (pictured above) to dry up for the first time in recorded history. Las Vegas has seen its \"most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping.\" In India, 40,000 cases of suspected heat stroke have been reported since this summer began.\n\nBut that \"pinnacle of warming\" factoid is less important than the caveat -- so far. There isn't really a pinnacle here, not yet, not until emissions come down dramatically and some of the CO2 already up in the atmosphere starts to come down, with our help or without it. As July turns to August the global average temperature will dip, as it always does, and at some point, the string of record-breaking months will stop as well (meaning we'll get the second- or third- or fourth-warmest September or November, not an actual below-average month). There may even be a year that dips down to fourth, or seventh, or ninth on the list of warmest years on record -- maybe.\n\nBut the lines, in general, will keep going up. Next July will offer a new chance to break Sunday's and Monday's record days; if it doesn't happen then, it will the following year, and probably again the year after that.", "source": {"uri": "splinter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Splinter"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernicus_Climate_Change_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copernicus Climate Change Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairbanks,_Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fairbanks, Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fairbanks, Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgrade"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/suploads/2024/07/serbia_heat_wave_lake_rusanda_climate.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

It is currently tracking as the second warmest on record.\n\nHeatwaves often have fatal consequences. Heat is the leading weather-related cause of death in the U.S, according to National Weather Service data. Nationally, more than 200 workers died on the job from extreme heat between 2018 and 2022, the last five years for which data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is available.\n\n\"We should not wait for disaster to protect our workers from the heat,\" said Boston City Councilor Benjamin Weber, a worker's rights attorney who chairs the Labor, Workforce, and Economic Development committee. \"Our mayor has made climate change and climate resiliency one of the cornerstones of her administration. Making sure that we have protections from the heat for our workers is a part of that.\"\n\nThere are no state-wide regulations in Massachusetts, nor local rules in Boston, that require employers to provide heat-related accommodations such as more frequent breaks, water access, air conditioning, time off for acclimation, or earlier start times. Very few states and municipalities nation-wide have such rules.\n\nThe Department of Labor this year proposed federal regulations to protect workers from heat. If implemented, they could require employers to control and evaluate heat hazards in the workplace as well as provide drinking water, breaks and more.\n\nHowever, it would likely be years before such a federal regulation took effect. The rule would almost certainly be fiercely challenged in federal court, labor law experts told city councilors.\n\nWeber said during an interview after the hearing that he plans to discuss workplace heat regulations with state lawmakers and others before proposing something to the council.\n\n\"Rather than just go draft an ordinance right now and file it, I think it's going to take a little more coordination,\" Weber said, but, \"I would like to do it this year, especially to have something in place before next summer.\"\n\nA key question for Boston is how the city could best regulate heat and in what workplaces. In Phoenix, one of the only cities with existing heat workplace regulations, an ordinance approved earlier this year requires city contractors and subcontractors to provide outdoor workers with rest areas, shade, and water, as well as training to recognize signs of heat stress.\n\nIt is unclear how far beyond the city's own operations such an ordinance in Boston could reach.\n\nCora Roelofs, an occupational safety and health researcher at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, said the city could require businesses to have a heat protection plan in order to obtain certain city permits. She added that the regulation ought to be strong enough to prompt action, otherwise employers may not comply.\n\n\"There has to be a stick,\" she said.\n\nCouncilors expressed interest in moving on regulations soon in the absence of federal or state laws protecting workers.\n\n\"I think this is something that Boston can really take the lead on,\" said Councilor Enrique Pep\u00e9n. \"I'm surprised that more municipalities haven't done something about this.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Labor_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Labor Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labor rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Lowell", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Massachusetts Lowell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyperthermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Councillor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Councillor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/t0bjOPx2UQazgreyj5mGifInvFU=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/AHCIISFHTVCY747XD6R65Y5UDU.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

Here's how to adapt to the heat during your holiday", "body": "50 degrees Celsius at noon. Melting roads. Out-of-control wildfires.\n\nThis is summer for parts of the northern hemisphere right now.\n\nThe searing heat has claimed many lives, from Crete to California, and New Delhi to Mecca, as temperature records have tumbled over the past month.\n\nSunday 21 July was the hottest day since at least 1940 according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nBut while Greece shuts the Acropolis and people suffer third-degree burns from footpaths in Las Vegas, it's all blankets and heaters in parts of Australia.\n\nWe're having a frosty winter, with a few Antarctic polar blasts, and many Australians from chillier regions will seek a temporary reprieve from the cold and head overseas for a \"Eurosummer\" or US vacay in July and August.\n\nBut the extreme temperature change between take off and landing is a huge test for the body, so preparing ahead of your trip may help you to stay safe in the heat.\n\nIf you live in southern Australia and travel to southern Europe or some parts of the US around this time of year, you can expect up to a 30-degree difference in maximum daily temperature.\n\nThat's a huge shock to the body, says Harry Brown, a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Canberra who specialises in seasonal acclimatisation.\n\nComing from winter, you will have a low tolerance to heat, and the physiological adaptations the body uses to stay cool, such as sweating more profusely, won't instantly activate when you touch down.\n\n\"It means a normal task like just a bit of sightseeing in Italy will increase our heart rate a lot more than if we were just walking around Canberra,\" Dr Brown says.\n\nWhile it's a myth your blood gets thinner when you swap cold weather for hot, your blood vessels do need to change size to cope with the temperature change.\n\nInstead of constricting to minimise heat loss, they dilate, bringing more blood to the skin and releasing heat.\n\nHumans can acclimatise -- we do it every time the season changes -- but it normally happens slowly over several months.\n\nWe can, however, build up our tolerance more quickly through repeat exposures to heat, and safely pushing ourselves to increase our physical activity, which raises our core temperature and blood flow to the skin.\n\nIt's a bit like what the Olympians have been doing in preparation for Paris.\n\n\"This constant disruption to our core temperature will prompt the body do things differently,\" Dr Brown says.\n\nSpecial heat adaptions will be \"turned on\" and allow us to endure high temperatures with less risk of heat stroke and death.\n\nThe key signs someone is acclimatised include:\n\nBut Dr Brown says it can take up to three months for someone to fully acclimatise if they aren't doing a specific regime for heat acclimatisation.\n\nAnd even if you're a physically fit person, meaning you're more heat tolerant to begin with, acclimatisation can still take 14 days.\n\nBy then, it's possible your Euro trip will be coming to an end.\n\nSo with acclimatisation likely impossible on a short holiday, it may pay to use some heat mitigation strategies to help you not only survive the conditions, but actually enjoy your trip.\n\n\"People pay a lot of money to get over there so they want to make the most of it,\" Dr Brown says.\n\nDon't just think 'I'll be right' when I get there.\n\nIf you have any pre-existing conditions or health concerns make sure you see a GP before you depart so you can discuss risks.\n\n\"Don't just leave it to chance, talk to your pharmacist or doctor because pre-planning goes a long way,\" Dr Brown says.\n\nIf you're generally fit and healthy though you could try to give your body a head start.\n\nMatthew Brearley is a heat stress consultant and works for the National Critical Care and Trauma Response Centre where he prepares Australian medical personnel for overseas deployment.\n\nHe says if you're up to it, you could try and get your sweat on by doing some physical exercise in warm conditions in the lead up to your holiday.\n\nWhether it's a heated yoga class or just putting on extra jumpers for a long walk, the idea is to raise your core temperature and get you sweating, which helps wake up those heat-coping adaptations.\n\nDr Brearley says a lot of his medicos do Bikram yoga to prepare for work in hot, humid environments.\n\n\"They find it helps them a lot.\"\n\nOnce the holiday begins, be amenable to adjusting your travel schedule -- it could save your life.\n\nDon't stick to set plans to do a hike on a specific day if the mercury is set to reach 44C.\n\n\"I know it's hard because people feel they have one chance to do something and they'll never be back here, so they take the risk and ignore the messages their body is giving them,\" Dr Brearley says.\n\n\"They will be really motivated to get to a certain viewpoint or landmark and that supersedes how they feel and they end up perishing.\"\n\nIn June, at least 10 tourists went missing or died in Greece after going walking in sweltering heat. One of those people was British doctor and author Michael Mosley.\n\n\"We make really terrible decisions when we're hot. We tend to underestimate the risk,\" Dr Brearley says.\n\n\"Plus you'll likely be jet-lagged from the flying, so fatigue is another risk factor when you're out in the elements.\"\n\nStaying hydrated is essential, but it's not a substitute for resting in the cool.\n\n\"Your body temperature will cause the harm and lead to a possible heat stroke,\" Dr Brearley says.\n\nThink of heat in your body as a see-saw. On one side, you have the heat being produced by your body, and on the other, the amount of heat you can lose.\n\nIf heat production outweighs loss, you need to decrease your activity level.\n\n\"That means walking very, very slowly if it's really hot, which probably isn't going to allow you to do what you want to do without prolonging your overall exposure,\" Dr Brearley says.\n\nSo, if possible, seek out air-conditioning, especially in the hottest parts of the day.\n\nA small misting bottle that fits in your bag is also an easy way to help you thermoregulate as spraying water on your face, arms and legs will increase evaporative cooling of the skin.\n\n\"That's especially good when there's a power outage or you're between accommodation,\" Dr Brown says.\n\nDousing your feet in cold water is another good cooling technique if you're showing any signs of heat exhaustion which include nausea, headache or muscle cramps.\n\nAnd if you have kids, put a damp muslin cloth over their stroller instead of a dry one. While it might provide some shade, a dry cloth can increase the temperature inside the stroller by 4C.\n\nAs global temperatures continue to rise, summer in the northern hemisphere is going to become increasingly dangerous, Dr Brown says.\n\nYoung children, those over the age of 65 and anyone with underlying health conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease or renal disease, will be most vulnerable to drastic temperature changes.\n\nAnd some countries don't have the infrastructure to deal with extreme weather and may have limited air-conditioning.\n\n\"It comes down to personal planning. Think about whether it's going to be worth going at that time of year if you're not fit and well,\" Dr Brown says.\n\nOlder people often sweat less so have more trouble cooling down. Certain medications, like those taken to control blood pressure, can also be dehydrating as they make people urinate more.\n\nBut, Dr Brearley says, even people who are physically fit should think carefully about what they do.\n\n\"Look at the conditions and ask yourself, 'Am I up for that?' If not, postpone or re-evaluate your plans based on the environment.\"\n\nEven if the forecast temperature seems tolerable, the humidity can tip you into the danger zone as it makes it harder for sweat to evaporate from your skin, which makes it harder to cool down.\n\nTravellers should keep up to date with local weather warnings, Dr Brown says, and check Smart Traveller for health advice specific to your holiday location.\n\nReturning to the Australian winter after weeks in the heat will be a bit of a shock to your body, but certainly not dangerous.\n\nYour thermal perception will be different, so you'll feel colder and perhaps more uncomfortable than before you left.\n\nBut it's generally easier for the body to generate heat than lose it.\n\n\"Layer up and trap the heat,\" Dr Brearley says.\n\n\"And obviously be smart and give yourself time.

Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nThe U.S. has faced multiple heat waves. Monday was the hottest-ever recorded day on the planet, beating the record set just the day before, AP News reported. For many workers, that's meant laboring in intense climates.\n\nIt's also been a summer full of new developments in politics and regulations.\n\nOn July 2, OSHA published a proposed rule, a quickly formed standard -- compared to previous rules -- in response to rising temperatures. It aims to better protect indoor and outdoor workers in all industries from extreme heat.\n\nBut just a few days prior, the Supreme Court overturned the Chevron doctrine, which required federal courts to give deference to federal agencies' reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutes. This development led many to wonder whether OSHA could even enforce a heat rule, should it be challenged. Nonetheless, SCOTUS declined to hear a challenge to OSHA's authority on July 2, USA Today reported.\n\nMeanwhile, this fall's presidential election could call into question the proposed heat rule's adoption as well. Should former President Donald Trump win, he could potentially stop the standard when his own Cabinet takes over, multiple sources told Construction Dive.\n\nAlthough these developments seem like they could be a deterrent to the new standard going into effect, legal experts say it still matters, regardless of whether it gets finalized.\n\n\"I think there are plenty of good, solid, legal reasons that this will never take effect, but my take is so what?\" said Phillip Russell, OSHA and employment lawyer, litigator and advisor for Washington, D.C.-based firm Ogletree Deakins. \"My perspective on this is that the content of this proposed standard has useful information for employers right now.\"\n\nRegardless of what happens with the OSHA heat standard, the text of it is a resource that contractors can use to bolster their safety practices. The best action now, lawyers told Construction Dive, is for construction pros to familiarize themselves with the rule, write or update their own company heat safety plan based on the proposal and follow it.\n\nUnder the proposed rule, employers must have a Heat Injury and Illness Prevention Plan. That plan would go into effect for a heat trigger -- when temperatures reach 80 degrees F or a wet bulb globe temperature equal to the NIOSH Recommended Alert Limit. The rule also calls for more actions to protect workers for a high heat trigger -- when temperatures reach 90 degrees or hotter.\n\nRequirements within that HIIPP include initial training for workers, access to water and shade, a designated heat safety coordinator and clear communication of the plan in every language spoken on the job.\n\nIn addition, the rule says that new workers or workers who are unaccustomed to the heat must have time to acclimatize to high temperatures. That's one reason the rule will likely face challenges, said Will Burton, Greensboro, North Carolina-based partner in Philadelphia-headquartered law firm Fox Rothschild.\n\nEmployers could call into question the science behind acclimatization, along with the temperature triggers, Russell also noted.\n\nIn addition, one section of the rule states, \"The employer must allow and encourage employees to take paid rest breaks ... if needed to prevent overheating.\" Russell called that \"problematic from a legal perspective.\"\n\nThere's also a question, Russell noted, of whether heat falls under OSHA's purview of ensuring that employers provide a safe workplace or if it is a broader health issue.\n\nEven still, the rule is an valuable resource, lawyers say.\n\n\"I think it would behoove any employer to go ahead and get into compliance with whatever the proposed rule is,\"said Ashley Brightwell, partner in Atlanta-based Alston & Bird's labor and employment group.\n\nFor over two years, OSHA has had a National Emphasis Program in place to reinforce its \"Water, Rest, Shade\" guidance for workers in high temperatures. Under the agency's general duties clause, employers are required to provide workers with an environment free from hazards, and to this point, heat has fallen under that.\n\nThat meant a lack of specificity, Brightwell said. Sure, employers know they need to keep workers safe from the heat. But precisely how OSHA expects them to do so, hasn't been crystal clear.\n\n\"In many ways [the proposed rule] has been a positive development,\" she said. \"There has been all kinds of confusion about what is required and discrepancies in when OSHA will cite and what they will cite for.\"\n\nBrightwell called the proposed rule \"a good road map\" for employers to use in crafting their own heat safety plan. At the very least, she said, companies have a better sense regarding what OSHA expects of them when it comes to protecting workers from heat.\n\nBurton called out that the agency published the rule in a different way than usual.\n\n\"At this point OSHA has taken in essence an unusual step of publishing a preview of a rule before it is published in the Federal Register,\" he noted. \"OSHA already has some level of authority to regulate [heat] under the general duty clause. It would be wise to take appropriate steps on some level to have heat-related considerations part of your overall safety plan, even if the rule is never finalized.\"\n\nBurton noted that soaring summer temperatures aren't going to just go away, and neither will OSHA, which will likely still use the general duties clause if the proposal isn't adopted.\n\nRussell, whose office is in Florida, said he has active heat inspections right now. The 80 degree temperature threshold would mean a large portion of work days in the state would fall into the HIIPP zone.", "source": {"uri": "constructiondive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Construction Dive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_phillips@constructiondive.com", "name": "Zachary Phillips", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Occupational Safety and Health Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_U.S.A.,_Inc._v._Natural_Resources_Defense_Council,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v.

The state's Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board approved the regulation last month, but it needed to be vetted for legal compliance.\n\n\"This regulation provides protections for workers across California and helps prepare employers to deal with the challenges of rising temperatures in indoor environments,\" said Debra Lee, chief of California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nCalifornia is among a few states responding to the growing impacts of climate change and extreme heat with worker safety standards. Earlier this month, the Biden administration proposed federal rules to protect indoor and outdoor workers from heat exposure as extreme heat, already the No. 1 weather-related killer in the U.S., becomes even more dangerous.\n\nCalifornia's standards require indoor workplaces to be cooled below 87 degrees Fahrenheit when employees are present and below 82 degrees in places where workers wear protective clothing or are exposed to radiant heat, such as furnaces. Worksites that don't have air conditioning may use fans, misters, and other methods to bring the room temperature down.\n\nThe rules allow workarounds for businesses if they can't cool their workplaces sufficiently. In those cases, employers must provide workers with water, breaks, areas where they can cool down, cooling vests, or other means to keep them from overheating.\n\nBut even with workarounds, businesses are concerned about the cost of complying with the regulation, especially small businesses that don't own their storefronts or are in old buildings, said Robert Moutrie, a senior policy advocate at the California Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"The simplest answer to this regulation is AC, and that's a costly investment,\" Moutrie said. \"If you're a small business and you don't own your structure, you can't make changes like creating a new space to cool down.\"\n\nThe rules have been in development since 2016 -- delayed, in part, because of the covid pandemic. The worker safety board requested the regulations be expedited. A standard review would have delayed the regulation taking effect until the fall, leaving workers largely unprotected from the summer heat.\n\nThe regulation applies to most indoor workplaces, including classrooms and even delivery vehicles. But state regulators exempted prisons and local correctional facilities after Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration projected it could cost the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation billions of dollars to implement.\n\nThe board intends to draft a separate regulation for the tens of thousands of workers at the state's 33 state prisons, conservation camps, and local jails. That could take a year, if not longer.\n\nIn 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services reported, 1,602 heat-related deaths occurred nationally, which is likely an undercount because health care providers are not required to report them. In 2023, HHS reported, 2,302 heat-related deaths occurred. It's not clear how many of these deaths are related to work, either indoors or outdoors.\n\nMeanwhile, global temperatures in June were a record high for the 13th straight month.\n\n\"This is really one of the biggest safety issues we see workers experiencing across California in many different industries,\" said Tim Shadix, legal director at the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, which lobbied for the protections. \"And the problem is only getting worse with climate change and hotter summers.\"", "source": {"uri": "kffhealthnews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kaiser Health News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samantha_young@kffhealthnews.org", "name": "Samantha Young", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Division_of_Occupational_Safety_and_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California Division of Occupational Safety and Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Chamber_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California Chamber of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermal radiation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Small business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal protective equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Department_of_Corrections_and_Rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservation movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1481252992.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sacramento, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

Advocates say the rule is long overdue.\n\nHeat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the U.S., killing at least 207 people in the nation in 2023. A new proposed federal rule aims to decrease fatalities in the workplace, as well as illnesses and injuries related to heat.\n\nThe Biden Administration made the proposal's announcement earlier this month. It's expected to help protect 36 million workers in both indoor and outdoor work settings from extreme heat, according to an Occupational Safety and Health Administration news release.\n\nThis would impact employees working all general industry, construction, maritime and agriculture jobs under OSHA's jurisdiction, according to the release.\n\nIf the proposal is finalized, it would require employers to make a plan for preventing heat illness and injury, including requirements for drinking water, rest breaks and monitoring indoor temperatures. Under the proposal, employers must also make a heat emergency response plan including a process to respond to an employee with signs of heat-related illness.\n\nLabor union United Farm Workers has advocated for heat protections since the early 2000s. The proposed rule has been a long time coming and is a big step forward, Communications Director Antonio De Loera said.\n\n\"It's a bittersweet moment, because we know that this probably would not have happened had workers not died, right?\" De Loera said.\n\nThis rule would be the first federal standard, but several states - California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado and Minnesota - have their own heat standards for certain workers. In California, which was the first state to enact rules in 2005, the law includes rules for employers to prevent heat illness, give access to drinking water, and offer cooling areas under certain conditions.\n\nThere are also states with laws limiting local leaders from expanding heat protections beyond what's required through state or federal law. Florida law blocks political subdivisions from making and mandating additional protections not required under state or federal law, and Texas law prevents local governments from making rules outside of state laws for certain industries.\n\nDe Lorea said compliance with heat protection law on the books is a problem in California, where many United Farm Workers members work. He said the group has a bill in the state's legislature to ensure employer compliance.\n\n\"But, of course, for workers in places like Arizona where a worker was killed last year, Texas, Florida, the federal rules are a huge step forward, right?\" he said. \"We can argue later about how we make sure that this right is enforceable, but step one is making sure that that right exists.\"\n\nFor Scott Blubaugh, the president of American Farmers and Ranchers and the Oklahoma Farmers Union, the proposed federal rule is common sense. He does not foresee the proposed rule impacting his operation because it mirrors practices he uses on his farm anyway.\n\n\"You know, the devil's in the details, of course, but I didn't see anything that would give me any worry about the rule,\" Blubaugh said.\n\nThe proposed rule has faced obstacles such as lobbying from groups. The American Farm Bureau Federation is one organization that has expressed hesitancy about federal rules surrounding heat safety.\n\nJohn Walt Boatright, the group's director of government affairs, said in a recent statement that farmers care about their workers.\n\n\"Yet another regulation comes on the heels of more than 3,000 pages of other new rules from federal agencies that impact how family farms operate and interact with their employees,\" Boatright said in the statement.\n\nThe federation is still analyzing the proposed rule and engaging with members to form the organization's comment to the proposal.\n\nRyan Flickner, senior director of advocacy at the Kansas Farm Bureau, said employee and operator safety is most important, but the uniform standard could be problematic because different places in the U.S. have different weather conditions.\n\n\"We're seeking feedback from our members what these, the 85 degrees or the 95 degrees, what those certain thresholds mean on a day-to-day farming operation,\" Flickner said.\n\nThe Oklahoma Farm Bureau also doesn't like a one-size fits all approach. Many operators are already taking measures, the organization's president, Rodd Moesel, said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"Oklahoma Farm Bureau members are concerned the proposed OSHA heat rules are not feasible or practical due to the nature of many agricultural operations and believe farmers and ranchers already make efforts to provide reasonable accommodations wherever possible,\" Moesel said.\n\nFederal officials are encouraging the public to submit comments on the proposal once it is posted on the Federal Register. The comment period will be open for 120 days after it is published.", "source": {"uri": "kcur.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

Whether they're toiling under the scorching sun or laboring next to a blast furnace, the risks of heat-related illnesses and accidents are ever-present and growing.\n\nFortunately, employers are recognizing this reality, as is OSHA and even state regulatory bodies, and implementing protocols to keep their workers safe and productive. With practical strategies to ensure the safety and well-being of construction workers, both inside and outside, businesses can maintain productivity and achieve greater worker retention too.\n\nThe constant threat of heat-related hazards in the summer necessitates the creation, implementation, and standardization of a heat plan to keep physical workers safe during the extremes of summer heat, or any other temperature related occupation.\n\nEven indoors, physical workers are not immune to the heat or over-exertion in the workplace. Moreover, even inside without the sun beating down, if the air temperature is in the 80's and the humidity is also high, then doing physical labor can push the body over the edge and into territory where it simply can't sweat enough to cool itself down. When this happens, potentially fatal heat stroke is right around the corner. Prevention is the key when it come to working in the heat, inside or out.\n\nHere are some of the best ways to prevent heat-related health effects while doing labor on job sites.\n\nHydration is key to combating heat-related illnesses, inside or outside. Workers should drink plenty of water throughout the day, even if they don't feel thirsty. Dehydration can sneak up quickly and present itself without a person ever even feeling thirsty at all, so it's essential to keep fluids flowing no matter how much a laborer desires a cool drink.\n\nLightweight, breathable clothing made of natural fibers like cotton are usually the best options when it comes to work clothes that can help you to beat the heat and still stay productive. This may not be possible on all work sites, especially those inside, but whenever possible, utilize this option as a resource for staying thermally regulated. Loose-fitting attire allows air to circulate, aiding in cooling by wicking away body heat. Avoid dark colors that absorb light rays and opt for whiter shades instead. The lighter colors will reflect the sun away from the body rather than absorbing it like dark colors do.\n\nThere's a good chance that the culture of the worksite isn't such that taking breaks randomly will be seen as a safety measure, but it is important to change this dynamic. Taking short breaks from the heat regularly can help to prevent the body from over-heating and going into stroke.\n\nWorking indoors doesn't mean people are exempt from heat breaks just because the sun isn't a factor. Schedule regular intervals to rest and cool down. Supervisors should foster and shepherd this tactic to ensure that it becomes engrained in the work environment. During these breaks, laborers should use the time to hydrate and replenish lost fluids.\n\nMaximize airflow by using fans or opening windows where possible. Proper ventilation helps dissipate heat and humidity, creating a more comfortable and safe working environment. Ensure equipment like fans are in good working order to optimize their effectiveness. If the structure permits, install these fixtures permanently in places that direct the airflow to workers who are in each station to achieve the best results.\n\nOutdoor labor presents its own set of challenges, but with the right precautions, workers can stay safe and healthy even in extreme conditions.\n\nHere are some of the most effective ways to prevent heat-related health hazards while doing labor on job sites outside.\n\nIt isn't too complicated, but staying hydrated be it indoors or outside is critical to preventing heat-related health problems. Outdoor work increases the risk of dehydration significantly, so it's crucial to drink plenty of water throughout the day even when not thirsty.\n\nEncouraging workers to carry water bottles and take regular breaks to rehydrate can not only help to prevent heat-related workplace issues, but it can also fundamentally increase productivity as well.\n\nShield yourself from the sun's damaging rays by wearing sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF) rating. A wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses can also offer additional protection for the face and eyes. Lightweight, breathable clothing with UPF (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) will also provide sun protection in extreme conditions.\n\nWorking in extreme heat can quickly lead to heat exhaustion, heatstroke, or even fatalities. Schedule frequent breaks in shaded areas to rest and cool down, even if the crew isn't interested in stopping the workflow. Encourage workers to listen to their bodies and take time out of the heat as is needed.\n\nEach job site might be relatively similar, but if major changes between sites are common, then implementing a regular meeting to explain and illustrate heat-related concerns and solutions is important.\n\nWhen possible, seek out shaded areas to escape the direct heat of the sun. If it's possible to do the job completely out of the sun and then transport the finished product to where it needs to be, then this is ideal. Even if it's only possible to do part of an operation out of the sun, it's best to take advantage of every opportunity to avoid exposure.\n\nTemporary shelters or canopies provide relief from the sun and help lower body temperatures too. Not all job sites will provide for this ability, but when possible erect a sun structure to prevent as much exposure as can be. Also, if possible, try to rotate tasks that need to be done in the sun between workers to minimize prolonged exposure for any one individual.\n\nPhysical laborers are not always aware of the significant challenges when working in extreme heat conditions, both indoors and outdoors, and it falls on the shoulders of management to ensure a safe workplace.\n\nBy staying hydrated, dressing appropriately, taking regular breaks, utilizing ventilation, wearing sun protection, and seeking shade when possible, workers can mitigate the risks of heat-related issues and accidents. Prioritizing safety and well-being ensures a productive and healthy workforce, even in the hottest of conditions.", "source": {"uri": "ishn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ISHN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Occupational Safety and Health Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_furnace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blast furnace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Standardization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunscreen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunscreen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_fiber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural fiber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermoregulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capillary_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capillary action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cotton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_protective_clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sun protective clothing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning_and_Stains", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Cleaning and Stains", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.ishn.com/ext/resources/Issues/2024/07-julAug/feat-0724-asap-image-forweb.jpg?height=418&t=1721930740&width=800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761088", "eventUri": "eng-9761088", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 102, "relevance": 1}

The state's Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board approved the regulation last month, but it needed to be vetted for legal compliance.\n\n\"This regulation provides protections for workers across California and helps prepare employers to deal with the challenges of rising temperatures in indoor environments,\" said Debra Lee, chief of California's Division of Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nCalifornia is among a few states responding to the growing impacts of climate change and extreme heat with worker safety standards. Earlier this month, the Biden administration proposed federal rules to protect indoor and outdoor workers from heat exposure as extreme heat, already the No. 1 weather-related killer in the U.S., becomes even more dangerous.\n\nCalifornia's standards require indoor workplaces to be cooled below 87 degrees Fahrenheit when employees are present and below 82 degrees in places where workers wear protective clothing or are exposed to radiant heat, such as furnaces. Worksites that don't have air conditioning may use fans, misters, and other methods to bring the room temperature down.\n\nThe rules allow workarounds for businesses if they can't cool their workplaces sufficiently. In those cases, employers must provide workers with water, breaks, areas where they can cool down, cooling vests, or other means to keep them from overheating.\n\nBut even with workarounds, businesses are concerned about the cost of complying with the regulation, especially small businesses that don't own their storefronts or are in old buildings, said Robert Moutrie, a senior policy advocate at the California Chamber of Commerce.\n\n\"The simplest answer to this regulation is AC, and that's a costly investment,\" Moutrie said. \"If you're a small business and you don't own your structure, you can't make changes like creating a new space to cool down.\"\n\nThe rules have been in development since 2016 -- delayed, in part, because of the covid pandemic. The worker safety board requested the regulations be expedited. A standard review would have delayed the regulation taking effect until the fall, leaving workers largely unprotected from the summer heat.\n\nThe regulation applies to most indoor workplaces, including classrooms and even delivery vehicles. But state regulators exempted prisons and local correctional facilities after Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration projected it could cost the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation billions of dollars to implement.\n\nThe board intends to draft a separate regulation for the tens of thousands of workers at the state's 33 state prisons, conservation camps, and local jails. That could take a year, if not longer.\n\nIn 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services reported, 1,602 heat-related deaths occurred nationally, which is likely an undercount because health care providers are not required to report them. In 2023, HHS reported, 2,302 heat-related deaths occurred. It's not clear how many of these deaths are related to work, either indoors or outdoors.\n\nMeanwhile, global temperatures in June were a record high for the 13th straight month.\n\n\"This is really one of the biggest safety issues we see workers experiencing across California in many different industries,\" said Tim Shadix, legal director at the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, which lobbied for the protections. \"And the problem is only getting worse with climate change and hotter summers.\"\n\nThis article was produced by KFF Health News, which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation.\n\nThis article was reprinted from khn.org, a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF -

Here's How to Stay Safe.", "body": "It's hot out there -- and it's only getting hotter. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, June 2024 was the hottest June in recorded history, capping 13 straight months of record-setting heat.\n\nEven without knowing those statistics, you can feel the heat. Sarasota and Manatee counties have already issued several heat advisories in July, and the humidity makes stepping outside feel like you're walking into a dog's hot, wet mouth.\n\nAs Floridians, we signed up for hot summers so we can enjoy mild, 65-degree January days while our neighbors to the north shiver in coats and boots. But as the mercury continues to rise, so does the risk of heat-related illness and injury.\n\nOutdoor workers who spend hours in the sun during the hottest part of the day -- construction crews, utility workers, landscapers, farm workers and roofers -- are at particularly high risk of heat illness, and city and county officials have few ways to help, since Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law this spring banning local governments from requiring heat and water breaks for outdoor workers. (In an interview in April, DeSantis told reporters that lawmakers in Miami-Dade County were responsible for the law due to their \"concern\" about how heat protections for workers would \"cause a lot of problems down there.\")\n\nHowever, Sarasota's Fair Foods Standards Council, which was founded in 2011, has been working on ways to protect agricultural workers from heat-related injury for years. The council oversees, audits and enforces the Fair Food Program, which was created after protests by the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, a human rights organization, which campaigned to improve the conditions under which tomato workers were laboring. Under the Fair Food Program, participating buyers -- including big-box stores like McDonald's, Whole Foods Market, Trader Joe's and Walmart -- pay a small premium to tomato growers, who pass that premium on to workers as a bonus on their paychecks. Between 2011 and 2018, more than $30 million in premiums were paid into the Fair Food Program.\n\nIn 2021, the council, the coalition and a group of participating growers issued a new set of heat safety measures for agricultural workers that include access to shade and water, mandatory breaks and elective rest periods for employees, trilingual training materials and emergency response protocols.\n\n\"Our heat stress protocols have been called the best in the country,\" says Mike Rios, the director of the Fair Food Standards Council. Rios replaced the council's founder, the Hon. Laura Safer Espinoza, five months ago; Espinoza continues to serve the organization in a senior advisory role. Before joining the council, Rios, 57, worked for the Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division for 27 years and conducted agricultural investigations in the southeastern U.S., including at many farms that partner with the Fair Foods Standards Council. Of the heat protection protocols, he says, \"We took a collaborative approach to getting things done, working in group meetings with the largest growers and producers in the Fair Food Program, who all said, 'We need to do something about this.'\" The result is that workers are safer, and the farms that employ them and the big-box stores they sell to have committed to the guidelines of the program, too.\n\nWhile the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Department of Labor have been hamstrung in implementing similar national regulations due to pushback from the agricultural industry, Rios says that because the Fair Food Standards Council is unattached to anything related to local, state or federal regulations, it is able to get things done much more quickly and without significant red tape.\n\nAnd, he says, the heat stress protocols dramatically improve workers' lives, including their mental health. \"Workers can take a break without fear of retaliation from their employer,\" Rios says. Violations are monitored by the Fair Foods Standards Council, which runs a 24/7 hotline year-round that farmworkers can call to report a problem if needed. \"If workers can't call, that's how the wheels fall off all of this,\" says Rios.\n\nMandatory breaks and employer-provided shade and water can literally save lives, especially when it comes to preventing a major illness like heat stroke, which can be deadly. \"Heat stroke is a true medical emergency,\" says Casey Howell, a 39-year-old trauma emergency resuscitation nurse and trauma injury prevention coordinator at Sarasota Memorial Hospital. People who experience it usually have extremely high temperatures (103 degrees or higher) and dry skin, have stopped sweating and, if they haven't lost consciousness, often complain about confusion, headaches, dizziness and nausea. \"If you think someone is experiencing heat stroke, get them to an emergency room immediately,\" says Howell.\n\nEven if your work doesn't require you to be outside, Howell says that Florida's consistently hot weather means that we should all know our personal risk tolerance and make responsible choices when we go outside. \"It's hotter and more humid than it used to be -- that's a statistical fact,\" she says. \"We need to get into a mindset of planning for the heat more than we might be accustomed to. You'll enjoy yourself more and be less susceptible to heat-related injuries.\"\n\nHowell's top tips and expert perspective from her career in trauma injury prevention.\n\n\"If you're very fair-skinned and burn easily, you can't tolerate the sun as long,\" Howell says. The very young and elderly are more prone to heat-related injury, and if you've been drinking the night before, you're at a higher risk of becoming dehydrated and getting sick. Certain medications, including diuretics and antihistamines, can also increase the risk of heat-related illness or injury and if you already have a sunburn or heat rash, those can increase sensitivity to heat and the sun, as well.\n\nThe hottest time of day is between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., so try to avoid being in the sun for extended periods doing those hours and avoid heavy work if you have to be outside. If you do, wear loose clothing made from ultraviolet protection factor, or UPF, fabric, which offers protection from the sun's UVA and UVB rays; sunglasses that block 99 to 100 percent of UVA and UVB rays; and a hat with a wide brim that covers the back of the neck and the ears, forehead and scalp. \"We lose about 20 percent of our body heat through the top of our head, so this may seem counterintuitive, but you're providing yourself with a bunch of shade by wearing a hat,\" says Howell.\n\nAs for SPF, Howell says to apply early and often. \"SPF 15 blocks 93 percent of U.V. rays and [formulas] increase incrementally from that, but if SPF 100 makes you feel better, wear it,\" she says. \"If you don't like chemical sunscreens, wear mineral. Just use it, and use more than you think you need. There's no risk in over-applying.\"\n\nAnd don't forget: Just because it's cloudy doesn't mean you can skip the 'screen. \"You will absolutely still burn on overcast days,\" Howell says.\n\n\"Drink all of the fluids!\" Howell says, but do avoid caffeine and alcohol. \"If water's not your thing, drink Gatorade, coconut water or herbal tea, but I want you to be well-hydrated.\" A good rule of thumb: \"If you drink soda, beer or something with alcohol or caffeine, follow it with two un-caffeinated, non-alcoholic beverages to maintain hydration,\" Howell says. \"Alcohol and caffeine are diuretics and pull fluids out of the body. You have to replace what you're losing and put in extra to maintain hydration.\" Get those 48-ounce tumblers ready.\n\n\"When the heat index is over 100, you should be much more cautious, especially when you think about sun exposure and workload,\" says Howell. \"You might be doing construction or landscaping, or you might just be running around in the yard with your kids, but for every 40 minutes in the sun, you should rest [in the shade] for 20 minutes, especially if you're outside during the hottest part of the day.\" According to Howell, people who aren't acclimated to Florida's heat and humidity are going to be much more susceptible to heat-related illness and injury, especially if they push themselves too hard.\n\nHeat exhaustion can lead to heat stroke, and knowing the warning signs is important. \"Heat exhaustion can make you feel terrible, but it's recoverable,\" says Howell. \"When you recognize the signs, you're already in it.\" Symptoms include heavy sweating; a fast, weak pulse; cold, clammy skin; muscle cramps; nausea or vomiting; tiredness or weakness; dizziness, headaches and feeling faint or even passing out.\n\nWhen it's really hot out, Howell says you should be sweating, especially if you're doing moderate to heavy work. \"The point at which you stop sweating is a major problem,\" Howell says. \"Active sweating is the body's intrinsic, natural way of cooling itself. When you can no longer produce sweat, your body has gone through its reserve of fluid to cool itself, and you're in a deficit.\" Other symptoms of heat exhaustion include muscle cramps in the calves and legs, lethargy, weakness, dizziness, a pale or clammy complexion, feeling like you might faint or even losing consciousness, a pounding headache and nausea.\n\nIf you feel bad in the heat, Howell says the first step is to immediately seek shade or go inside so you can get out of direct sunlight and reduce your body's ambient temperature. Drink fluids or eat something cold, like a Popsicle, to cool down, and jump into a pool or hose yourself down if you can. \"You want to get your body temp down as quick as possible,\" she says.",

If temperatures hit 87 degrees, employers have to provide additional support to workers, such as air conditioning.\n\nWho the rules apply to: The rules apply to all indoor workplaces, including restaurants, warehouses, and industrial facilities. Prisons, jails and juvenile detention centers, however, are exempt. The state decided to not include those facilities at the last minute, citing concerns about the cost of upgrading more than 30 adult state-owned prisons across the state, most of which are cooled by fans or evaporative coolers, not air conditioning.\n\nThe background: Outdoor workers have had similar protections in place for years, but that hasn't been the case for people who work indoors. Advocates and workers, particularly warehouse workers in the Inland Empire, have been pushing for an indoor heat standard for years as the climate crisis drives increasingly dangerous extreme heat and puts more workers at risk of heat-related illness and even death.\n\nWhat's next: Enforcement of the rules will be key. That's been a major challenge in protecting outdoor workers even with regulations on the books.

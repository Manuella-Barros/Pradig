And it doesn\u2019t get lost upon me that she put aside her own dreams in order to support mine. Again, forever in your debt. The fact that nothing that I do, any of these moments, the special occasions, all these events, none it is special without you by my side.\u201d \"She put aside her own dreams in order to support mine.\" Chris Hemsworth thanked his \"endlessly encouraging\" wife Elsa Pataky in his Hollywood Walk of Fame speech. pic.twitter.com/nKhN5xDx2Z \u2014 AP Entertainment (@APEntertainment) May 28, 2024 In some ways, Hemsworth\u2019s comments about his wife harken back to words Ryan Gosling spoke when he won the Golden Globe for his performance in La La Land. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to be up here without standing on the shoulders of a mountain of people, and there\u2019s just no time to thank everyone I just would like to try and thank one person properly and say that while I was singing and dancing and playing piano and having one of the best experiences I\u2019ve ever had on a film, my lady was raising our daughter, pregnant with our second and trying to help her brother fight his battle with cancer,\u201d he said. \u201cIf she hadn\u2019t have taken all that on so that I could have this experience, it would surely be someone else up here other than me today. So, sweetheart, thank you,\u201d he added.

The character could be exposed in upcoming scenes, after hints made by other residents amid his abuse towards Belle Dingle. After coercively controlling her and manipulating her for months, Tom also isolated and stalked his wife to keep tabs on her. His desperation to control every aspect of her life has left her trapped, and in recent episodes he turned violent and physically assaulted her. It all reached a head in recent scenes when Belle snapped and shoved Tom, seen by other villagers. But amid Belle feeling unable to confess about Tom's behaviour as he continues to set her up, acting as if he's the victim, might someone work out the truth? With Belle now admitted to a Mental Health Crisis Assessment Centre with her family fearing she's struggling to cope, unaware of the trigger, it could be the beginning of the end of Tom's reign of terror... Cain Dingle scene Belle's brother Cain Dingle has recently seemed concerned, and in two moments this month he appeared to suspect something was up. Might Cain find out exactly what Tom has been up to in recent weeks, and will he be the one to stop Tom? We saw him watching the couple from afar prior to Belle being admitted to the centre. He asked them what was going on too after Mandy Dingle had expressed concern following a row. Cain then invited them to dinner no doubt to suss out what was going on, while weeks ago we also saw him air his suspicions over the faked break-in at Belle's house. With Belle now struggling, Cain has appeared to keep Tom away from her, so might Cain figure out what's going on with Belle and what Tom has been up to? Belle confesses? One thing that could expose Tom would be if Belle reveals the ordeal she's been through since her wedding to Tom. While she may feel too scared to do this, especially now that the spotlight is on her, might she find the courage to speak out? Belle is the only one that knows the full story of her ordeal, while there's still things she's yet to uncover including that she's being stalked by Tom, and that Tom attacked her pal Vinny Dingle. But will Belle end up confiding in the centre or a loved one about Tom's abuse, and the fact he's putting pressure on her to start a family with him? Lydia Dingle remark In a recent episode, in a bid to isolate Belle any further, Tom tampered with her medication, leaving the vulnerable character upset and confused as she reached out to a mental health crisis team for support. After Lydia, Sam and Cain insisted Tom leave Belle to have the meeting alone, they returned to find Belle being led away as she revealed she was heading to a mental health crisis assessment centre. Tom was against the idea as he tried to stop Belle from going, who insisted it was just for a little bit, while Lydia, who picked up on Belle not being herself, commented: \"It's for the best, they'll get to the bottom of exactly what's been going on.\" Taking to Twitter, now X, viewers are convinced Lydia's remark was a foreshadowing clue at Tom's fate as fans hope Belle will expose him at the centre. Police twist Tom is still hiding the fact that there was no break-in earlier this year, and he trashed the place after Belle lied to him about her whereabouts. Tom faked two visits to the police station and further chats with them about the culprits. Belle and others were suspicious when it emerged only her wedding rings were gone, and nothing else was taken. Suzy Merton grilled Tom over the robbery at the time like Cain, and it was clear something did not sit right with her. After all she worked out pal Mary's partner Faye was a fraud, so might she also figure out Tom lied? What if someone asks at the station about the robbery, and they find out there was never a report by Tom? Mandy or Vinny learn the truth? Two other characters tipped to rumble Tom and bring him down are Mandy and Vinny. Vinny was attacked by Tom who was jealous of him and Belle's friendship. So will Vinny finally realise he was behind it at some point, and how will his mother Mandy react to this? Mandy herself was left worried when she noticed Belle had not been herself, and tried to offer her advice. Mandy has interfered a couple of times now, and viewers know she's the last person to drop it when she's onto something. So might she figure out Tom's actions and could she spark his downfall? Emmerdale airs weeknights at 7:30pm on ITV1 and ITVX, with an hour-long episode on Thursdays.* Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "summary": "Emmerdale's Tom King has stepped up his vile abuse against wife Belle Dingle, but surely it's only a matter of time before his actions are exposed on the ITV soap", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/emmerdales-tom-kings-downfall-sealed-32897284", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32897286.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/24_05_emm_tom_belle_04.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:56:39", "author": "Charlotte Tutton,Charlotte-tutton", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Charlotte-tutton"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.335}

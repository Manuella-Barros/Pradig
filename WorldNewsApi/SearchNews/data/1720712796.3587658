As they poured back through the gates this morning the rain failed to dampen spirts or fashion serves. Today will see some major musical acts take to the stage, with Doja Cat headlining The Valley this evening, while Kaytranada and TSHA will take to the Parklife stage. Fans can also expect performances from ANOTR, Rudimental, Anne Marie, Uncle Waffles and Children of Zeus.

Denim was out in full force again, along with mini skirts, baggy cords and a hoodie or two. Many pumped for the second day of music were waiting patiently to see headliners like Doja Cat and Kaytranada, but others were hoping to get in there early to watch the likes of Ella Henderson, Child of Zeus, Shy FX and Horsegirl. The weather will remain overcast and cloudy with a chance of some rain throughout the day, and temperatures will start at 11\u00b0, peaking at 12\u00b0 between 3pm and 7pm and dropping to 10\u00b0 by the end of the night, hitting 9\u00b0 at midnight. Heavy rain is forecast again at 10pm and is expected to continue following the curfew with a 90% chance of rain as the festival comes to a close, but these hardy festival-goers have proven that they're more than cut out for a bit of rain.", "summary": "Day two of Parklife saw festival-goers brave the rain but fashion looks still served", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/gallery/35-best-dressed-people-day-29322503", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29322818.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Parklife-Fashion-day-2.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:11:36", "author": "Jenna Campbell", "authors": ["Jenna Campbell"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.092}

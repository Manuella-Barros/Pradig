The urgent need for such help was underscored by a Russian missile attack on Sunday that hit a children's hospital in Kyiv - with an estimated 300 reported injured, including four children, and two deaths, including a young doctor.\n\nIn remarks at the Reagan Foundation on Tuesday night, Zelensky said that Ukraine needs 128 F-16's to defend against Russia's aerial attacks.\n\n\"We need 128, this is the fleet, all these numbers our partners have,\" Zelensky said.\n\n\"So till moment when we will have 128 with them in the sky - anyway it will be difficult.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_kelly@thehill.com", "name": "Laura Kelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/AP24135301271753-e1715778103585.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721761", "eventUri": "eng-9721761", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

On Wednesday morning, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said during the NATO Public Forum that Denmark and the Netherlands have begun the transfer of U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine.\n\nNATO SUMMIT: LIVE UPDATES\n\nUkraine is in desperate need of as many air defense systems as possible as Russia continues to use its air dominance to carry out aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities. Leaders have repeatedly asked for air defense systems and interceptors, and they have asked for fighter aircraft since the early moments of the war.\n\n\"Those jets will be flying in the skies of Ukraine this summer to make sure that Ukraine can continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression,\" Blinken said.\n\nDutch officials have said they would transfer 24 F-16s to Ukraine, while Denmark is expected to provide another 19. With the agreements made by Belgium and Norway, Ukraine's F-16 fleet could be about 60 planes once all of them that have been promised are provided. Other countries could choose to provide them as well.\n\nIn response to the news, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the countries involved, noting, \"I anticipate that our air force capability coalition will be strengthened even further through the joining of new participants. F-16s bring just and lasting peace closer, demonstrating that terror must fail everywhere and at any time.\"\n\nZelensky did warn a day earlier that Ukraine really needs over 100, at least, to counter Russia's fleet of 300 jets.\n\n\"The problem with F-16 [transfers] is the number and the dates,\" the Ukrainian president said Tuesday evening. \"Russia uses 300 jets on the territory of Ukraine, 300 jets. They have more, but they use 300 jets. We have a decision about some 10, 20 [F-16s]. Even if we will have 50, it's nothing. They have 300. ... Because we are defending, we need 128. All these numbers, our partners. So, until the moment when we will have 128 jets, we will not compare with them in the sky. Anyway, it will be difficult.\"\n\nU.S. forces have been training Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s in Arizona.\n\nThe U.S. and Germany also announced Wednesday that the U.S. would begin episodic deployments of long-range fire capabilities in Germany starting in 2026, which both governments said in a joint announcement \"will demonstrate the United States' commitment to NATO and its contributions to European integrated deterrence.\"\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg also announced Wednesday during the NATO public forum that the alliance will establish a NATO command for Ukraine, which he said would \"facilitate and ensure the training and delivery of security assistance to Ukraine\" and noted that roughly 700 personnel will take over what the U.S. had been doing in leading the coordination effort.\n\nHe described this effort as to \"institutionalize\" a framework for the alliance's continued support for Ukraine.\n\nStoltenberg said he supports Ukraine's desire to join NATO in the long term as a way to fend off Russia's continued aggression, which dates back to Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and was escalated in February 2022, when Russian forces invaded Ukraine with the intent to topple the government and take over.\n\n\"When the fighting stops, we need to ensure that Ukraine has the capabilities to deter future aggression from Russia, and they need security guarantees,\" Stoltenberg said. \"And of course, the best and strongest security guarantee will be Article Five. So therefore I believe that the way to ensure it stops is actually NATO membership.\"\n\nA senior NATO official, however, told reporters Tuesday that \"this is not a conflict that is likely to be over anytime soon, that this is something that's going to take years of dedicated effort to ensure that Russia does not prevail here.\"\n\nThe NATO summit in Washington comes just days after Ukraine was hit by a major Russian aerial attack against multiple cities that left dozens of people dead. A Ukrainian cancer hospital was hit in Kyiv, killing multiple people.\n\n\"F-16s will also be used to bolster Ukraine's air defense,\" Zelensky said. \"I am confident that they will assist us in

Norway also announced it would also begin deliveries of six F16s to Kyiv this year as western allies stepped up their pledges of support for Ukraine's defence against Russia's full-scale invasion.\n\n\"Those jets will be flying in the skies of Ukraine this summer to make sure that Ukraine can continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression,\" Blinken said at an event on the sidelines of the Nato leaders' summit in Washington.\n\nThe alliance is making a series of pledges this week aimed at \"building a bridge\" for Ukraine to eventually join its ranks.\n\nThe US on Monday announced it would transfer an additional Patriot system to Ukraine in addition to air defence pledges from other member states, while Nato is also setting up a new command centre in Wiesbaden, Germany to co-ordinate training and equipment donations.\n\nKyiv has long pleaded for F-16s pledged by western nations to be delivered as soon as possible. But shipments of the planes have been slowed down by the complex training of Ukrainian pilots and maintenance engineers required, while some military experts have doubted the effectiveness of deploying older F-16 models in Ukraine.\n\nFighter jets such as the F-16 are seen as crucial in bolstering Ukraine's defence against Russia's attacks, particularly given their ability to shoot down incoming missiles and potentially Russian aircraft used in bombing raids. Washington agreed last summer to allow the transfer of the advanced aircraft.\n\n\"We are committed to further enhancing Ukraine's air capabilities, which will include squadrons of modern fourth generation F-16 multi-role aircraft,\" the leaders of the US, Netherlands and Denmark said in a joint statement Wednesday. \"We will continue to co-ordinate jointly in support of Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russian aggression.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is in Washington for the summit, said on X that the delivery of the Danish and Dutch jets was \"a clear signal that Russia's ability to terrorise Ukrainian people, cities, and communities will continue to reduce\",\n\nHe added: \"F-16s bring just and lasting peace closer, demonstrating that terror must fail everywhere and at any time.\"\n\nDuring an address at the Reagan Institute on Tuesday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine needed 128 F-16s to match Russia's air force. \"Until we have 128, we will not be able to match them in the skies, and it will be difficult.\"\n\nThe 79 F-16 jets pledged by Ukraine's allies so far falls short of that target, however.\n\nWhile Ukraine has long sought the fighter jets, analysts questioned how much of a difference the F16s would make because the donated jets are older models.\n\n\"The planes will be old with very old specification and no match to Russia in

pledge \u20ac40bn of support for Ukraine for the next year in a bid to streamline commitments and also in a nod to domestic turmoil in many member states.\n\n\"We are able to provide more if we want

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also mentioned the news during a public forum.\n\n\"Those jets will be flying in the skies of Ukraine this summer to make sure that Ukraine can continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression,\" Blinken said to applause.\n\nThe transfer has been long in the making and much anticipated by Ukraine, whose leaders have pleaded for as much air defense capability as possible given the Kremlin's numerical advantage when it comes to missiles and other munitions.\n\nDenmark, Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium had earlier committed to shipping more than 60 U.S.-manufactured F-16 jets to Ukraine this summer.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday during a side event that his country needed at least 128 F-16s, and that the ones on the way were too few and are coming too late in the battle.\n\n\"Even if we will have 50, it's nothing,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We need -- they have 300. We need ... because we are defending, we need 128.\"\n\nAnother major issue for Kyiv is pilot training. Ukraine has voiced frustration with the pace of pilot training in the U.S., but Washington has countered that it has limited school seats and can't train as many pilots as are available.\n\nThe joint statement from President Joe Biden and his Danish and Dutch counterparts offered few specifics about the transfer but noted that more help was on the way.\n\n\"The transfer process for these F-16s is now underway, and Ukraine will be flying operational F-16s this summer. We are unable to provide additional details at this time due to operational security concerns,\" the leaders said in the statement. \"We are grateful to Belgium and Norway for committing to provide further aircraft.\"\n\nIn May 2023, Biden greenlit other countries' requests to send their F-16s; such permission was required under the rules of their original sales. Ukrainians argue that flying F-16s will help Kyiv push back Russian forces from the frontlines in places such as Kharkiv.\n\nOn Monday, in what some observers said was Russian President Vladimir Putin's message to the NATO alliance, a Russian missile struck a children's hospital in Ukraine, damaging the facility and forcing its young patients onto the streets.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721761", "eventUri": "eng-9721761", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

F-16 multi-role aircraft\".\n\n\"The coalition intends to support their sustainment and armament, as well as further associated training for pilots to enhance operational effectiveness,\" they said.\n\n\"We will continue to coordinate jointly in support of Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russian aggression.\"\n\nThe NATO summit falls at a critical time for Biden, who is facing questions about his health and ability to serve another term as US president after he delivered a disastrous 2024 election debate performance late last month.\n\nThe Democratic Party leader, who is expected to face off against his Republican predecessor Donald Trump in November's election, has dismissed calls to drop out of the race.\n\nDuring an address on Tuesday evening to mark the start of

Those planes -- together with jets that Belgium and Norway have promised to give, bringing Ukraine's F-16 fleet to about 60 planes -- could enable Ukrainian forces to counter the Russian warplanes used to launch the \"glide bombs\" that have devastated Ukrainian cities in recent months, while hastening the transition of Ukraine's air force away from its Soviet legacy into a fleet that relies on NATO-standard equipment.\n\n\"For the next decade, country after country has vowed to help Ukraine build its deterrent and defense capacity,\" Blinken said. \"That sends the strongest possible message to Vladimir Putin that he cannot outlast Ukraine. He can't outlast Ukraine's partners. So the military trajectory is clear.\"\n\nThat optimistic outlook was belied on Tuesday by Ukrainian complaints that long-promised military assistance \"is still delayed\" -- and that President Joe Biden seems to believe that \"partial solutions are better than better than victory,\" as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky put it at the Ronald Reagan Institute.\n\n\"The problem with F-16 [transfers] is the number and the dates,\" Zelensky said Tuesday evening. \"Russia uses 300 jets on the territory of Ukraine, 300 jets. They have more, but they use 300 jets. We have a decision about some 10, 20 [F-16s]. Even if we will have 50, it's nothing. They have 300. We need -- because we are defending -- we need 128. All these numbers, our partners. So, until the moment when we will have 128 jets, we will not compare with them in the sky. Anyway, it will be difficult.\"\n\nStill, Zelensky heralded the transfer on Wednesday as a triumph. \"F-16s bring just and lasting peace closer, demonstrating that terror must fail everywhere and at any time,\" he said on social media.\n\nZelensky and other Ukrainian officials have requested the jets since the earliest weeks of the full-scale invasion, as Ukraine's successful defense of Kyiv set the stage for a protracted war further east. Biden and other Western leaders have gradually transferred larger quantities of more advanced weapons, often after lengthy debates about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would deem the shipments provocative.\n\nThe battlefield efficacy of the incoming F-16s will depend on practical considerations, such as the availability of trained Ukrainian pilots and maintenance crews, as well as political ones such as the quantity of jets ultimately provided and the targets that Western allies allow Ukrainian forces to strike, according to military analysts.\n\n\"The missing component of air superiority for Ukraine is an offensive air capability, which the F-16s will begin to provide,\" a trio of Center for Strategic and International Studies experts wrote last month.\n\n\"[T]he Ukrainian Air Force can focus on establishing localized air superiority over limited areas for limited times. Such localized air superiority would be coordinated with Ukrainian land offensives to support a breakthrough operation and would be most effective with combined arms operations. Giving F-16s to Ukraine is an essential move toward establishing air superiority.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nStill, Dutch officials have cautioned against overstating the value of the planes, while pledging to continue to provide support over the long term.\n\n\"There is not one weapon system that can bring total victory,\" Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans told European Pravda in a recent interview. \"We need to keep supporting Ukraine in all dimensions. We also need to make sure that the strength and the perseverance of Russia is diminished over time and make sure that the position of Ukraine is getting stronger and stronger.\"", "source": {"uri":

The coalition, according to the leaders, intends to assist with the maintenance, armament, and pilot training for these jets.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in turn, announced that a transfer of F-16 fighter jets was currently underway from Europe to Ukraine. \"I'm also pleased to announce that as we speak, the transfer of F-16 jets is underway, coming from Denmark, coming from the Netherlands, and those jets will be flying in the skies of Ukraine this summer to make sure that Ukraine can continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression,\" Blinken said at the NATO Public Forum. Commenting on the development, Andrey Kartapolov, head of the State Duma Defense Committee told Sputnik that the transfer of F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine will not affect the course of the special operation and will change nothing.\"We have known for a long time that they would give them something by the end of the summer; they have nothing else left but the F-16. Now they will be giving them, perhaps a dozen or so, but it will not change anything at all. We have been expecting them for a long time, and we have been preparing. It will not affect the course of the special operation,\" said Kartapolov. He noted that after the transfer of F-16s to Ukraine, Russian pilots and air defense personnel \"will have new stars on their fuselages and new medals on their chests.\"Russia has consistently warned against the West's continued arms deliveries to Ukraine, saying that they only prolong the conflict. New supplies of weapons by the West to Kiev, including F-16s, cannot fundamentally change the situation on the ground, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously said.", "source": {"uri": "sputnikglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sputnik International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Kartapolov", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrey Kartapolov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Duma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State Duma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sputnik 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Peskov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Peskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/images/sharing/article/eng/1119326732.jpg?10166824211720625663", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721761", "eventUri": "eng-9721761", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The US had previously been concerned about the potential for escalation but relaxed its position, partially to allow the bombing of targets inside Russia by long-range artillery.\n\nKeir Starmer, the UK's prime minister, said he was happy to see Ukraine use Storm Shadow missiles to attack targets inside Russia as long as they were used to defend itself - and in accordance with international law. \"It is for defensive purposes, but it is for Ukraine to decide how to deploy it for those defensive purposes,\" he said.\n\nIt ends a lengthy wait for Ukraine, whose president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has been lobbying for at least 18 months for western jets to complement its small and ageing Soviet standard air force, which is no match for Russia's.\n\nZelenskiy said he was grateful to Denmark, the Netherlands and the US for taking what he described as practical steps of assistance - and indicated that he was hopeful of more donations to boost numbers to a target of 130.\n\n\"F-16s will also be used to bolster Ukraine's air defence. I am confident that they will assist us in better protecting Ukrainians from brutal Russian attacks, such as this week's strike on the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv,\" the president said.\n\nNorway and Belgium have also committed to supplying F-16s in the future, but Zelenskiy went further and said: \"I anticipate that our air force capability coalition will be strengthened even further through the joining of new participants.\"\n\nRelated: Nato will announce 'historic' Ukraine aid package - but hospital attack shows it's not enough\n\nIt remains unclear how effective the F-16s, a combat jet designed in the 1970s, will be in the war against Russia. Particularly important will be how they are concealed and protected when on the ground, at a time when Ukraine's air defences have been stretched.\n\nThis month, Russia said it had destroyed five Ukrainian Su-27 jets in an Iskander missile attack on an airbase in Myrhorod. Ukraine acknowledged some losses amid criticism that the planes were lined up on the tarmac in daylight within range of Russian missiles.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Joe Biden, the US president, announced that Nato members would supply four Patriot anti missile batteries, while Italy would supply a similar Samp-t, which could be used to protect airbases from Russian attacks.\n\nConfirming the development, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said: \"As we speak, the transfer of F-16 jets is under way, coming from Denmark, coming from the Netherlands\".\" It should, he added, \"concentrate Vladimir Putin's mind on the fact that he will not outlast Ukraine\".\n\nUkraine is not expected to become a member of Nato until the end of its war with Russia, as several countries, led by the US, believe that immediate membership would in effect lead to a war between Moscow and the military alliance.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"},

We need ... because we are defending, we need 128.\"\n\nAnother major issue for Kyiv is pilot training. Ukraine has voiced frustration with the pace of pilot training in the U.S., but Washington has countered that it has limited school seats and can't train as many pilots as are available.\n\nThe joint statement from President Joe Biden and his Danish and Dutch counterparts offered few specifics about the transfer but noted that more help was on the way.\n\n\"The transfer process for these F-16s is now underway, and Ukraine will be flying operational F-16s this summer. We are unable to provide additional details at this time due to operational security concerns,\" the leaders said in the statement. \"We are grateful to Belgium and Norway for committing to provide further aircraft.\"\n\nIn May 2023, Biden greenlit other countries' requests to send their F-16s; such permission was required under the rules of their original sales. Ukrainians argue that flying F-16s will help Kyiv push back Russian forces from the frontlines in places such as Kharkiv.\n\nOn Monday, in what some observers said was Russian President Vladimir Putin's message to the NATO alliance, a Russian missile struck a children's hospital in Ukraine, damaging the facility and forcing its young patients onto the streets.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience_Flights", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Experience Flights", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/71a3408/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/1200x800%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F36%2Fd8%2F05d669314044b827112338543796%2F8471488.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721761", "eventUri": "eng-9721761", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

In a speech in Washington on Tuesday evening, Zelenskiy said the losses from the war were \"difficult\" and that seeing dead children \"you want to kill Putin at this moment.\"\n\nIn Congress, dozens of Trump's closest allies have voted repeatedly against assisting Zelenskiy's government, although Democrats and more internationally focused Republicans have worked together to approve the existing aid levels.\n\nA senior NATO official said this week that Russia lacks the munitions and troops to start a major offensive in Ukraine, but that it could sustain its war economy for three to four more years. Ukraine also has not yet amassed the munitions and personnel it needs to mount its own large-scale offensive operations, the official said.\n\nOn the sidelines of the meeting, Biden is expected to meet new British Prime Minister Keir Starmer for their first face-to-face talks since Starmer's Labour Party won a landslide election victory that ended 14 years of Conservative rule. The countries are key trans-Atlantic allies.\n\nBiden will host a dinner for NATO heads of state and government on Wednesday, an event that would not normally draw attention but has come into focus given concerns over whether he could handle the demands of the presidency for another four years.", "source": {"uri": "arynews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "ARY NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A statement issued jointly by Danish leader Mette Frederiksen, new Dutch prime minister Dick Schoof and US president Joe Biden confirmed the transfer is underway.\n\n\"Ukraine will be flying operational F-16s this summer,\" they say. It is unclear how many jets are included in the initial tranche.\n\nVarious NATO members have pledged nearly 100 F-16s to Kyiv, including 42 jets from the Netherlands, 19 from Denmark and 30 from Belgium. Norway initially committed two F-16s from its fleet but upped the number to six ahead of the summit.\n\nWhile the USA is not providing aircraft, transferring the American-made fighters requires approval from the Biden Administration. The US Air Force is also supporting efforts to train Ukrainian aviators and maintenance technicians.\n\nDutch fighter pilot Major General Arnoud Stallmann has been appointed commander of the international coalition supplying F-16s to Ukraine.\n\nNATO officials have declined to provide details about the location or date of the fighter handover, citing Russian interest in targeting the long-sought aircraft.\n\nAt least initially, the fighters will likely be used in a more-conservative air-defence role, rather than for air-to-air combat or close-air support.\n\n\"First and foremost, the priority is self-defence and air defence,\" Dutch defence minister Ruben Brekelmans said in Washington on 10 June. He left open the possibility that the role could expand as more F-16s arrive in Ukraine. \"We will keep training Ukrainian pilots so they can be used for more offensive manoeuvres and also to help ground troops in the future.\"\n\nThe USA recently lifted many restrictions on American-provided weapons being used to strike targets inside Russian territory, citing Ukraine's need to effectively combat a Russian offensive in the border region around Kharkiv.\n\nSeparately from the F-16 summit announcement, nine NATO members also pledged new donations of air defence batteries, including the USA, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Italy, Canada, the UK, Norway and Spain.

Moscow renewed its aerial assaults on Ukraine's national power grid in the spring, causing sweeping blackouts.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week that he wanted to double Ukraine's air defence capacity over the summer and that his country needed at least seven additional Patriot systems to protect itself. Nato members have announced the delivery of five additional Patriot and other strategic air defense systems to help Ukraine. Still more aid announcements were expected at this week's summit in Washington, which marks the alliance's 75th anniversary.\n\nA joint statement from the leaders of the United States, Denmark and the Netherlands said the Danish and Dutch governments were in the process of donating American-made F-16s to Ukraine, with the support of the United States. \"We are grateful to Belgium and Norway for committing to provide further aircraft, and to the other members of the Air Force Capability Coalition for their support,\" the statement said.\n\nNato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters on Wednesday morning that Nato allies were expected to agree a \"substantial\" package for Ukraine and would expand other partnerships particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nStoltenberg said the package would involve a new Nato command for Ukraine to provide security assistance and training, and a long-term pledge to continue and sustain support for Kyiv.\n\nHe said there would be new announcements of immediate military support, including air defense and moves to ensure full interoperability between Ukrainian forces and Nato forces. He also said he expected allies to reiterate a commitment that Ukraine will become a member of Nato. In a forceful speech on Tuesday, Biden said the 32-member collective security alliance was \"stronger than it's ever been\". -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "omanobserver.om", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oman Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MIM-104 Patriot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collective security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.omanobserver.om/omanobserver/uploads/images/2024/07/10/thumbs/600x600/2714347.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721761", "eventUri": "eng-9721761", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Ukraine aims to deploy these jets strategically despite logistical and operational hurdles.The first batch of U.S.-built F-16 fighter jets are already being transferred to Ukraine from Denmark and the Netherlands and will be flying over Ukrainian skies this summer, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday.\n\nThe length of the process, from procuring the U.S.-designed aircraft and training Ukrainian pilots to fly them, has frustrated Kyiv.\n\nRussia has had time to prepare defences to try to nullify the F-16s' impact, and Ukraine has had to survive with a depleted air force a fraction of the size and sophistication of the enemy's.\n\nHere are some facts about how the F-16s may help Ukraine and what obstacles still lie in the way of effective deployment:\n\nPOTENTIAL IMPACT\n\nSome analysts say the F-16s will not alone prove a turning point in the war, which began with Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\n\"You'd have to separate symbolism from the actual impact on the battlefield - which will be useful but modest, particularly in the beginning,\" said Mark Cancian, senior adviser with the International Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nSerhii Kuzan, chairman of the Ukrainian Security and Cooperation Center, a non-governmental research group, said at least 60 planes would be needed for significant operations as Ukraine attempts to push Russian aviation back from its borders.\n\nLawmaker Oleksandra Ustinova, who leads Kyiv's parliamentary commission on arms and munitions, said that Ukraine would need nearer to 120 F-16s to boost its air capability significantly.\n\nWhile the pilots gain experience in Ukrainian skies and the military builds out its air infrastructure, the initial deliveries could at least help Ukraine strengthen its air shield, experts say.\n\n\"It will provide some air defence and depth capacity, potentially also help intercepting Shaheds [Iranian-built drones] and cruise missiles. Although it is a very expensive way of doing that, munitions-wise,\" said Justin Bronk, senior research fellow for airpower and technology at Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).\n\nUkraine's military has worked hard to reduce the threat to the arriving F-16s in recent months by attacking Russian air defences, according to Kuzan.\n\n\"The formation of the battlefield, especially in the south, is already taking place,\" he said. \"Ukraine has the capabilities to systematically strike Russia's foremost air defence complexes.\"\n\nBut Cancian of CSIS said he expected Ukraine to try to open gaps in Russia's defences in the immediate run-up to planned F-16 attacks rather than a long time in advance.\n\nPILOTS AND MAINTENANCE\n\nTraining will be crucial.\n\n\"You can have lots of fast jets but if they don't have effective weapons, and air crew able to employ them with effective tactics, then they will just be shot down in large numbers,\" said Bronk.\n\nThe timeline for the training of Ukrainian pilots on F-16s has dominated discussions about deliveries and pledges of more than 70 jets.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Ukraine expects to have at least 20 pilots ready to fly F-16s, Ustinova said.\n\n\"It is difficult to solicit more planes when you don't have people to pilot them,\" she said, adding that, at first, Ukraine will have more F-16s than qualified pilots.\n\n\"Waiting in line for 10 years before our pilots are trained is not OK.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nU.S. officials have directed questions on training to Ukraine and noted that pilots can also be trained in Europe. However, Bronk said NATO's capacity was already stretched.\n\nHe added that aircraft maintenance was an even more pressing challenge than pilot training.\n\nHe said most repairs and maintenance would need to happen inside Ukraine, and it would probably have to rely on foreign contractors who know the aircraft.\n\nAIR BASES UNDER THREAT\n\nRussia has already intensified its attacks on infrastructure that could be used for the maintenance and deployment of F-16s, some experts said.\n\n\"Russia is striking all airfields, potential F-16 bases, every day, including attempts to damage airstrips and infrastructure. These strikes have not paused for the last two months, at least,\" Kuzan said.\n\nThe targets will become all the more valuable when the aircraft, pilots and maintenance teams arrive. This is likely to force Ukraine to install missile defences to protect them, even though it is short of both air defence systems and ammunition.\n\n\"We have to accept the fact that the airfields will be well-protected when civilian objects could be under attack,\" Kuzan said, adding that each base would need at least two Patriot and two NASAMS batteries to secure it.\n\n\"As soon as we (build up our flight capabilities), we will push their planes back and the terror will stop. But these couple of months will be truly difficult,\" Kuzan added.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal United Services Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center for Strategic and International Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruise missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASAMS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASAMS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainian_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainian Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artillery battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIM-104_Patriot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MIM-104 Patriot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111640418,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-81080,overlay-etdefence/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721761", "eventUri": "eng-9721761", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

It is unclear how many operational F-16s each country is donating.\n\n\"We are unable to provide additional details at this time due to operational security concerns,\" the leaders stated.\n\nAustin praised the transfer at the NATO Public Forum, an event running parallel to the summit, and said a coalition of countries has been \"working tirelessly\" to round up operational F-16s for Ukraine.\n\nDenmark and the Netherlands pledged last year to send about 60 of the fighter jets but were awaiting permission from the United States. The U.S. began training Ukrainian pilots to fly F-16s in the fall in preparation for the transfer.\n\nUkraine has long requested the aircraft, which entered U.S. military service in the late 1970s and is used by numerous countries in the NATO alliance.\n\nThe U.S. has not offered to send its own F-16s, and the Biden administration had initially hesitated to send the war plane because Ukraine already had a fleet of Soviet-era fighters with which they were more familiar.\n\nAustin said NATO will continue to search for ways to help Ukraine. The transfer of F-16s is part of a package of aid that members at the summit are offering, which also includes the donation of strategic air-defense systems.\n\n\"We will not be dragged into [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's reckless war choice, but we will stand by Ukraine as it fights for its sovereignty and security,\" Austin said.\n\nHe said NATO is the strongest that it has ever been, and the U.S. will continue to stand by the alliance. Questions about what the potential reelection of former President Donald Trump, a NATO skeptic, could mean for the alliance have swirled at the summit.\n\nAustin appeared to address those jitters on Wednesday, ending his brief speech with a forceful reaffirming of America's commitment to NATO and its mission.\n\n\"America is stronger with our allies, America is safer with our allies and America is more secure with our allies,\" he said. \"Any attempt to undermine NATO only undermines American security.\"", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"},

Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re also announced Wednesday that Oslo would donate six F-16s from its inventory.\n\nWhile Biden approved training Ukrainian pilots on the aircraft and OK'd other countries donating the jets in May 2023, it's taken more than a year to deliver the systems to the battlefield, partly due to the amount of time it's taken to train the pilots, US officials have said.\n\nWhile US defense experts have told The Post that Kyiv likely will not use F-16s for \"dogfighting\" with Russia jets, Yuriy Sak, a former adviser to Ukraine's defense ministry, said their primary mission would be to deter Moscow's aerial assaults.\n\n\"The most important function of those F-16s will be its integration into our air-defense system,\" Sak, now an adviser to Kyiv's Minister of Strategic Industries, Oleksandr Kamyshin.\n\n\"Essentially, we look at F-16s first and foremost as a flying air defense system that is capable of simply decreasing the amount of attacks - aerial attacks, missiles, drones - that Russia is carrying out on Ukraine.\"\n\nCurrently, Ukraine relies on older aircraft, including the Soviet-made MiG29 and Russian Sukhoi jets - to counter Moscow's capabilities. F-16s, however, have newer technology and better targeting capabilities to track and strike down other jets in the air.\n\n\"F-16 radars will allow them to see Russian planes even at the time of takeoff,\" Sak told The Post. \"And that means that Russian fighter and bomber pilots [that] the Russians use to launch glide bombs will not feel so confident.\n\n\"At the moment, it's a free run for them, you know?\" he added. \"They just take off, launch these bombs and go have a cup of tea.\"\n\nUkrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky has pleaded since Russia began its invasion in February 2022 for NATO members to donate F-16s to his forces.\n\nBiden had been hesitant to sign off on sending the jets, with the administration citing fears of \"escalating tensions\" with Russia.", "source":

I am confident that they will assist us in better protecting Ukrainians from brutal Russian attacks, such as this week's strike on the Okhmatdyt children's hospital in Kyiv,\" the president said.\n\nNorway and Belgium have also committed to supplying F-16s in the future, but Zelenskiy went further and said: \"I anticipate that our air force capability coalition will be strengthened even further through the joining of new participants.\"\n\nIt remains unclear how effective the F-16s, a combat jet designed in the 1970s, will be in the war against Russia. Particularly important will be how they are concealed and protected when on the ground, at a time when Ukraine's air defences have been stretched.\n\nThis month, Russia said it had destroyed five Ukrainian Su-27 jets in an Iskander missile attack on an airbase in Myrhorod. Ukraine acknowledged some losses amid criticism that the planes were lined up on the tarmac in daylight within range of Russian missiles.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Joe Biden, the US president, announced that Nato members would supply four Patriot anti missile batteries, while Italy would supply a similar Samp-t, which could be used to protect airbases from Russian attacks.\n\nConfirming the development, Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said: \"As we speak, the transfer of F-16 jets is under way, coming from Denmark, coming from the Netherlands\".\" It should, he added, \"concentrate Vladimir Putin's mind on the fact that he will not outlast Ukraine\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Ukrainian Air Forces may now go from training on jets held and operated by the Netherlands and Denmark to having custody of some.\n\n\"I highly doubt they would make a public statement about it\" if the F-16s were immediately moving onto Ukrainian airfields, Bronk said.\n\nThe reason for that could be safety. In the last week, Bronk noted, Russia has targeted four Ukrainian airfields with ballistic missiles -- guided by aerial drones that Ukrainian forces apparently lacked the interceptors to take down. It's unclear how many actual planes, as opposed to decoys, Kyiv lost.\n\nBut the attacks are a reminder of a much larger challenge for Ukraine, Bronk said: Without enough air defense, its military can't use F-16s anywhere near their full potential.\n\nTo wit, U.S. President Joe Biden opened the NATO summit on Tuesday by announcing an agreement with four other countries to send Ukraine more air defense batteries.\n\nThe U.S., the Netherlands and Denmark lead a group of countries that helps provide Ukraine with air power. The Danish and Dutch governments first agreed to send Ukraine the jets last year, and other countries, including Norway and Belgium, have since joined. The number thus far pledged to Ukraine is about 65.\n\nNorwegian officials on Wednesday clarified that Oslo's contribution would cover six F-16s. \"We plan to start delivering the aircraft in the course of 2024,\" Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re was quoted as saying in a statement. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said earlier this year his country would donate 30 planes. The Netherlands has promised 24, according to Reuters.\n\nIt was at last year's NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, where countries initially agreed to start training Ukrainian pilots to fly the fighters. One of the most difficult challenges has been a language barrier, since the jargon used by pilots and crews is highly technical and there's no time to clarify a word mid-flight.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, there are just over 12 Ukrainian pilots training to fly the jets between Denmark and the U.S. right now. While a handful graduated from the course in late May, the number in the pipeline is too small, some Ukrainian officials argue.\n\n\"If we're expected to have up to 20 machines by the end of the year, we need pilots,\" Igor Zhovkva, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said in an interview. \"We are asking now [from] all of our partners for two things: to increase the number of places for training, because currently it is not enough, and secondly to optimize the period of training\" -- essentially speed it up.\n\nOne of the main issues with increasing that capacity is the long queue of countries already waiting for the U.S. Air Force to train their pilots. Yehor Cherniev, who leads Ukraine's parliamentary delegation to NATO, told Defense News that he and other lawmakers asked Congress for a list of those nations so Ukraine can negotiate with them to swap spots.\n\nAmerican lawmakers didn't agree to do so, he said.\n\nThe F-16s have long been a priority for Ukraine. Receiving them may help with morale and the country's actual defense.\n\nIn the medium term, they could also pair well with two airborne surveillance planes Sweden pledged for Ukraine at the start of the summer. These can help the Ukrainian Air Forces with targeting as well as command-and-control, Swedish Defence Minister P\u00e5l Jonson said in an interview.\n\n\"That's the difference between a third-generation fighter, which the Ukrainians are operating, and the fourth-generation fighter,\" he said.\n\nFor his part, Bronk questions how Ukraine will train on and then operate these surveillance planes. They will need experienced Ukrainian crews and then must pair them with pilots who have expertise on the F-16 before there is a positive effect for the embattled country, Bronk said.\n\n\"Where are they going to fly from? Who's going to maintain them? And are they going to fly and operate inside Ukraine, or are they going to fly around the borders?\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "defensenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Defense News"},

The Netherlands will donate Patriot parts, and Italy will send the Franco-Italian-made SAMP/T.\n\nUkrainian officials pressed their backers for air defence systems in recent months, saying they identified 100 available Patriots.\n\n\"In the coming months, the United States and partners intend to provide Ukraine with dozens of tactical air defense systems, including NASAMS, HAWKs, IRIS T-SLM, IRIS T-SLS, and Gepard system,\" the White House also announced on Tuesday (9 July).\n\nWashington, they said, \"will re-sequence planned deliveries of critical air defence interceptors in coordination with partners, so they are delivered to Ukraine, providing Ukraine with hundreds of additional air defence interceptors over the next year.\"\n\nDonating such systems comes at a high price for non-US NATO members, as delivery times are long. Romania, for instance, donated its only battery and asked the US to replace them rapidly, which they have not done so far.\n\nOn the same day, NATO announced that members will order 940 anti-aircraft surface-to-air Stinger missiles , for \u20ac700 million.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Still more aid announcements were expected at this week's summit in Washington, which marks the alliance's 75th anniversary.\n\nA joint statement from the leaders of the United States, Denmark and the Netherlands said the Danish and Dutch governments were in the process of donating American-made F-16s to Ukraine, with the support of the United States.\n\n\"We are grateful to Belgium and Norway for committing to provide further aircraft, and to the other members of the Air Force Capability Coalition for their support,\" the statement said, adding that the group was committed to further enhancing Ukraine's air capabilities.\n\nReporting by Humeyra Pamuk, Daphne Psaledakis and Doina Chiacu Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Peter Graff\n\nDaphne Psaledakis\n\nThomson Reuters\n\nDaphne Psaledakis is a foreign policy correspondent based in Washington, D.C., where she covers U.S. sanctions, Africa and the State Department.

Although it is a very expensive way of doing that, munitions-wise,\" said Justin Bronk, senior research fellow for airpower and technology at Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).\n\nUkraine's military has worked hard to reduce the threat to the arriving F-16s in recent months by attacking Russian air defences, according to Kuzan.\n\n\"The formation of the battlefield, especially in the south, is already taking place,\" he said. \"Ukraine has the capabilities to systematically strike Russia's foremost air defence complexes.\"\n\nBut Cancian of CSIS said he expected Ukraine to try to open gaps in Russia's defences in the immediate run-up to planned F-16 attacks rather than a long time in advance.\n\n\"You can have lots of fast jets but if they don't have effective weapons, and air crew able to employ them with effective tactics, then they will just be shot down in large numbers,\" said Bronk.\n\nThe timeline for the training of Ukrainian pilots on F-16s has dominated discussions about deliveries and pledges of more than 70 jets.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Ukraine expects to have at least 20 pilots ready to fly F-16s, Ustinova said.\n\n\"It is difficult to solicit more planes when you don't have people to pilot them,\" she said, adding that, at first, Ukraine will have more F-16s than qualified pilots.\n\n\"Waiting in line for 10 years before our pilots are trained is not OK.\"\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nU.S. officials have directed questions on training to Ukraine and noted that pilots can also be trained in Europe. However, Bronk said NATO's capacity was already stretched.\n\nHe added that aircraft maintenance was an even more pressing challenge than pilot training.\n\nHe said most repairs and maintenance would need to happen inside Ukraine, and it would probably have to rely on foreign contractors who know the aircraft.\n\nAIR BASES UNDER THREAT\n\nRussia has already intensified its attacks on infrastructure that could be used for the maintenance and deployment of F-16s, some experts said.\n\n\"Russia is striking all airfields, potential F-16 bases, every day, including attempts to damage airstrips and infrastructure. These strikes have not paused for the last two months, at least,\" Kuzan said.\n\nThe targets will become all the more valuable when the aircraft, pilots and maintenance teams arrive.

This is really what will help Ukraine to build a full-fledged air force, and Belgium will make the biggest contribution to this.\"\n\nHe reminded that Belgium is the largest donor of fighter jets to Ukraine.

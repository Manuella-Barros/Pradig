Tom Weatherall, 90, is searching for the missing honours, which include the British Empire medal, the Queen's 1953 Coronation Medal and the RAF Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, after they went missing at the 80th anniversary event, which saw veterans gather in France. The ex-miner was called up for national service in 1953 and was asked to be an RAF right marker, typically the tallest member of a parade, at Queen Elizabeth II's coronation thanks to his six-foot-two-inch stature. He later rejoined as a caterer in the forces but his career was cut short after he received a wound to his arm caused by a shard of glass. He previously told Forces News he lost four-and-a-half pints of blood in a four-and-a-half hour stint in hospital after the incident. Tom Weatherall, 90, pictured at Ranville earlier this week.

The veteran, who was stationed outside Westminster Abbey with the RAF, said: 'As an ex-pit lad, it was a real privilege to be part of the Coronation Squad. 'On the day I was outside Westminster Abbey, and we saluted and presented arms as the Queen got out of her carriage. 'As soon as the Queen was inside, we marched off and enjoyed the party atmosphere with a few pints in the Elephant and Castle.'

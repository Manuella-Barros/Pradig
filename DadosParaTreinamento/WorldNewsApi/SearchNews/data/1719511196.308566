[+] the 77th annual Cannes Film Festival Corbis via Getty Images \u201cI say the future of cinema is where it started: in a movie theater,\u201d American filmmaker Sean Bakers declares as he receives the Palme d\u2019Or for Anora at the 77th edition of the Cannes Film Festival. Buzzy studios like Neon, Mubi or A24 came and have now gone home with their hands full of very strong contenders for the upcoming awards season, such as Jacques Audiard\u2019s Emilia Perez or Coralie Fargeat\u2019s body horror The Substance. Thankfully, these movies should all have a theatrical release. Anora \u201cThis is for all sex workers \u2014 past, present and future,\u201d declares Sean Baker in his acceptance speech. Anora was acquired by Neon in the U.S, which marks the company\u2019s fifth Palme d\u2019Or in a row, following Anatomy of a Fall last year. Starring Mickey Madison, Anora is described as a love story between a rich Russian oligarch and a sex worker. The Substance Coralie Fargeat\u2019s The Substance won an award for Best Screenplay at Cannes. The movie stars Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley and was bought by Mubi, who just announced that it will be released in U.S. theaters September 20th. In The Substance, an aging actress takes a new medication to reveal a new, better, younger version of herself. Emilia Perez Netflix seems to be nearing a deal for U.K. and U.S rights to Jacques Audiard\u2019s Emilia Perez, Variety first reported. Starring Selena Gomez, Zoe Salda\u00f1a and Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, the cast won Best Actress Ensemble last night.

Set in Mumbai, the film tells the story of a nurse who still longs for her husband after he left her to work in Germany, right after their arranged marriage. It came as a strong contender for the Palme d\u2019Or late into the festival, and was acquired by Sideshow and Janus Films in the U.S. Megalopolis We might think that the year a filmmaker like Francis Ford Coppola releases a new movie, studios would relentlessly be bidding to acquire the rights of distribution. However, the colossal $120M project carried by Coppola for decades, still can't find a domestic distributor. Megalopolis was first acquired by Le Pacte in France, and secured rights of distribution in 13 more countries during the festival, including Australia, on top of the first five distributors who bought it before the festival. Bird Andrea Arnold\u2019s latest movie, Bird, starring Barry Keoghan, Franz Rogowski and Nykiya Adams was bought by Mubi for U.K and Ireland ahead of the Cannes premiere and is still waiting for a U.S. distributor. This coming-of-age story takes the audience across the street of a small town, where a 12-year-old who lives with her father, befriends a mysterious man. The Seed of a Sacred Fig Neon bought Mohammad Rasoulof\u2019s film The Seed of a Sacred Fig, which won the Prix Special of the jury last night. A few weeks ago, Rasoulof was sentenced to jail time and flogging in Iran, and we learnt a couple of weeks ago that he had secretly fled his home country ahead of the Cannes premiere. For a while, it was unsure if the filmmaker could attend the screening in Cannes. He finally received his award last night and got a long standing ovation inside the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Lumi\u00e8re.

[+] Festival Corbis via Getty Images Parthenope It was one of this year\u2019s most anticipated film at the Cannes Film Festival but also one that really divided the critics. Acquired by A24 before the festival, Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s Parthenope, starring Celeste Dalla Porta and Gary Oldman, was shot between Naples and Capri and is described as an \u201cexploration of the relentless pursuit of freedom, an insatiable love for a city with countless faces, and myriad forms of love itself.\u201d The Girl With The Needle Mubi also acquired The Girl with the Needle, by Swedish director Magnus Von Horn. Starring Vic Carmen Sonne and Trine Dyrholm, the film is shot entirely in black and white and is inspired by a true story. It takes places in the 1910s in Copenhagen and tells the story of an infants\u2019 serial killer, Dagmar Overbye.

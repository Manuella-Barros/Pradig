(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend.\n\nDebby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It is now a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is expected to return to land over an already soggy South Carolina coast early Thursday before picking up speed and moving north.\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain forecast, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDebby, which first made landfall in Florida early Monday and has moved slowly ever since, will speed up as it heads to the north and north-northeast across the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic states later Thursday and on Friday.\n\nHeavy rainfall is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nDays of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday night, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east-northeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank. ___ This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to total rainfall amounts for the Carolinas.\n\n___\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is expected to return to land over an already soggy South Carolina coast early Thursday before picking up speed and moving north.\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain forecast, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDebby, which first made landfall in Florida early Monday and has moved slowly ever since, will speed up as it heads to the north and north-northeast across the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic states later Thursday and on Friday.\n\nHeavy rainfall is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nDays of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday night, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east-northeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank. ___ This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to total rainfall amounts for the Carolinas.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina. Associated Press journalists Russ Bynum in Pooler, Georgia; Bruce Shipkowski in Toms River, New Jersey; Jeff Martin in Atlanta, and Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington, contributed.\n\nMore from this section\n\nHarris introduces new running mate Minnesota Gov.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend.\n\nDebby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It is now a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain forecast, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDays of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday.

Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank. ___ This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to total rainfall amounts for the Carolinas.\n\n___\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is expected to return to land over an already soggy South Carolina coast early Thursday before picking up speed and moving north.\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain forecast, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDebby, which first made landfall in Florida early Monday and has moved slowly ever since, will speed up as it heads to the north and north-northeast across the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic states later Thursday and on Friday.\n\nHeavy rainfall is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nDays of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday night, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east-northeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank. ___ This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to total rainfall amounts for the Carolinas.\n\n___\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

It is now a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain forecast, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDays of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank. ___ This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to total rainfall amounts for the Carolinas.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend.\n\nDebby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It is now a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain forecast, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDays of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home.

It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice.

Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia.

The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nAnd about 3 a.m. Thursday, an apparent tornado spawned as Debby's outer bands blew through North Carolina damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.

But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act might come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.

It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.

A part of Interstate 95 around Fayetteville, North Carolina, was shut down after water topped the freeway, the North Carolina Highway Patrol said. Troopers gave no indication of when the interstate could reopen.\n\nAt least 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain have fallen in the area since Debby first started crawling toward the region.\n\nAn average of more than 50,000 vehicles a day pass through the stretch of I-95, the freeway that connects Florida to Maine.\n\nDebby spawns apparent tornado in North Carolina that damages homes, church and school\n\nAn apparent tornado spawned as Debby's outer bands blew through North Carolina damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.\n\nThe county said in a statement the tornado touched down around 3 a.m. Thursday.

The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAs Debby drenches South Carolina, heavy rainfall from the tropical storm is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nAt least four dams breached by floodwaters in eastern Georgia county\n\nIn Bulloch County northwest of Savannah, Georgia, at least four dams have been breached by floodwaters, but so far no fatalities have been reported, authorities said at a Wednesday news briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county's director of emergency management. About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County.

Meanwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey have also experienced heavy rains connected to the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nInterstate 95 is shut down around Fayetteville, North Carolina due to flooding\n\nFlooding closed one of the major highways along the East Coast on Thursday morning. A part of Interstate 95 around Fayetteville, North Carolina, was shut down after water topped the freeway, the North Carolina Highway Patrol said. Troopers gave no indication of when the interstate could reopen.\n\nAt least 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain have fallen in the area since Debby first started crawling toward the region.\n\nAn average of more than 50,000 vehicles a day pass through the stretch of I-95, the freeway that connects Florida to Maine.\n\nDebby spawns apparent tornado in North Carolina that damages homes, church and school\n\nAn apparent tornado spawned as Debby's outer bands blew through North Carolina damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.\n\nThe county said in a statement the tornado touched down around 3 a.m. Thursday. No injuries were immediately reported.\n\nThe storm could bring more tornadoes as the day goes on in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said.\n\nDebby on Wednesday influenced thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes. And the National Weather Service's office in Charleston said survey teams earlier confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nDebby makes landfall again and could cause problems into weekend\n\nTropical Storm Debby is heading up the East Coast as it has made landfall for a second time. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAs Debby drenches South Carolina, heavy rainfall from the tropical storm is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nAt least four dams breached by floodwaters in eastern Georgia county\n\nIn Bulloch County northwest of Savannah, Georgia, at least four dams have been breached by floodwaters, but so far no fatalities have been reported, authorities said at a Wednesday news briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county's director of emergency management. About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFrequent floods are part of life along the water\n\nGene Taylor was waiting for a few inches of water to drain back out of his home as high tide passed Wednesday afternoon at his home along French Quarter Creek, not far from the Cooper River in Huger and about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston.\n\nThis is the fourth time his home's been flooded in the past nine years, and he heeded the warnings this time, moving things up or out.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home -- a common annoyance now.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as Tropical Storm Debby's rainfall drains out to sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia have neared 18 feet, surpassing previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nSouth Carolina's drama is still playing out\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported from Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bans develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend.\n\nDebby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It is now a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 km/h).\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimetres) of rain forecast, as well as in portions of Virginia, according to the hurricane center.\n\nDays of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nAnd about 3 a.m. Thursday, an apparent tornado spawned as Debby's outer bands blew through North Carolina damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said. No injuries were immediately reported. Debby could bring more tornadoes Thursday in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said.\n\nFlooding from heavy rains closed a major freeway along the East Coast. Interstate 95 near Fayetteville, North Carolina, was shut down before sunrise Thursday and officials did not say when that portion of the freeway linking Florida to Maine would be reopened.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometres) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimetres) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of deja vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometres) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighbourhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimetres) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighbourhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\n------", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news",

Some areas could see 6 to 8 inches, according to the NWS office in Greer, South Carolina.\n\nLake Norman, Concord, Monroe and Rock Hill, South Carolina, can expect amounts similar to Charlotte, while Gastonia, Lincolnton and other communities west of Charlotte could see smaller totals, according to NWS maps.\n\nWeather models as of Wednesday showed these amounts of rain falling across the region through Friday: 4.5 inches in Charlotte, 5 1/4 inches in Concord, 4.9 inches in Statesville, 4.6 inches in Lincolnton, 6.5 inches in Salisbury and 4.3 inches in Rock Hill, NWS meteorologist Doug Outlaw said.\n\nDebby's outer rain bands were expected to arrive in Monroe about 8 p.m. Wednesday and midnight in Charlotte, Outlaw said.\n\nOn Monday, the maps predicted 2 to 4 inches for Charlotte throughout the week. National Weather Service maps on Tuesday forecast 4 to 6 inches.\n\nThe NWS on Tuesday issued a flood watch from late Wednesday through Friday for Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, Iredell, Union and Rowan counties and the South Carolina counties of York and Chester.\n\nThe latest expected rainfall totals could produce \"numerous instances of flash flooding, with significant flooding possible,\" according to the flood watch alert.\n\nSome voluntary evacuations were underway in Eastern North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said during an 11 a.m. news conference in Raleigh on Wednesday.\n\n\"We expect this storm to continue its slow, gradual approach, bringing multiple days of heavy rainfall and the potential for widespread and severe flash flooding,\" Cooper said. \"Have an emergency plan for your household.\"\n\nCharlotte Fire's swift water rescue team was deployed to Elizabethtown in Bladen County on Wednesday morning to lend assistance. North Carolina Emergency Management activated Mooresville Fire-Rescue's 11-member swiftwater rescue team to Harnett County.\n\nAt 5 p.m. Wednesday, Debby was slowly approaching the South Carolina coast at 3 mph, about 50 miles southeast of Charleston, according to the National Hurricane Center. Winds increased to 60 mph from 45 mph earlier in the morning, center officials said.\n\nThe storm could weaken on Thursday after the eye moves inland, officials said.\n\nDebby is expected to move faster north and northeast across the Carolinas and the Mid-Atlantic on Thursday and Friday, officials said.\n\nSome outer bands of rain from Debby were reported in southern Union County on Tuesday, before the center of the storm moved off shore in South Carolina, Outlaw said. Bursts of rain popped up near uptown Charlotte.\n\nIt was impossible to say how quickly the rain would fall, NWS meteorologist Steve Wilkinson told The Charlotte Observer on Tuesday.\n\nThat's because Debby is \"very slow moving\" and not traveling in a straight line, he said.\n\nIf the rains spread out over time, flooding threats lessen, he said.\n\nForecasters also don't know when the worst of the deluge will descend on Charlotte.\n\nRains are expected all day Thursday, Thursday night and into Friday, Wilkinson said.\n\nThrough Saturday morning, the storm could dump 10 to 20 inches of rain on southeast Georgia, South Carolina's coastal plain and southeast North Carolina, The News & Observer reported. Some areas could see up to 30 inches.\n\nCharlotte Douglas International Airport saw a big drop in canceled and delayed flights from Debby on Tuesday and Wednesday, compared with Monday. As of 1:30 p.m. Tuesday, 137 flights were delayed and 56 were canceled, according to FlightAware.com, which tracks flights at the nation's airports.\n\nAt 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, at least 195 delays and 25 cancellations were reported. On Monday, at least 640 flights were disrupted.\n\nTo prevent flooding on Charlotte streets, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services urged residents to check storm drains near their homes and clear any blockages. Mecklenburg County offices will be closed for in-person services Thursday.\n\nAll city of Monroe lakes will be closed Thursday and Friday due to the weather and potential flooding, Monroe Water Resources staff said.\n\nAt noon Wednesday, Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord opened its campgrounds to coastal and other evacuees.\n\nCampers should check in at the Camping World Racing Resort office, 6600 Bruton Smith Blvd., which can be accessed at the entrance to zMAX Dragway.\n\nAfter-hours arrivals should park near the camping office and check in during regular business hours. Evacuees will have access to speedway bathhouses.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday night, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east-northeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank. ___ This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference

Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAs Debby drenches South Carolina, heavy rainfall from the tropical storm is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nAt least four dams breached by floodwaters in eastern Georgia county\n\nIn Bulloch County northwest of Savannah, Georgia, at least four dams have been breached by floodwaters, but so far no fatalities have been reported, authorities said at a Wednesday news briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county's director of emergency management. About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFrequent floods are part of life along the water\n\nGene Taylor was waiting for a few inches of water to drain back out of his home as high tide passed Wednesday afternoon at his home along French Quarter Creek, not far from the Cooper River in Huger and about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston.\n\nThis is the fourth time his home's been flooded in the past nine years, and he heeded the warnings this time, moving things up or out.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home -- a common annoyance now.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as Tropical Storm Debby's rainfall drains out to sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia have neared 18 feet, surpassing previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nSouth Carolina's drama is still playing out\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported from Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bans develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"},

It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned that isolated areas could see up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain from Debby.\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no fatalities have been reported so far, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon following severe storms there, according to PowerOutage.us. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said.\n\nAct 2 was to arrive overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bands develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday evening, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east-southeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the Brown Dog Deli closed early Monday and couldn't open Tuesday due to a curfew decreed by local officials. On Wednesday the lunch crowd poured in after days of storm preparations and hunkering down. The first words from the person answering the phone were: \"Yes, we're open.\"\n\n\"We've got a lot of locals walking in after being cooped up for two days looking for a good meal,\" kitchen manager Liz Denney said.\n\nSome water got around the sandbags that employees placed Monday, but the restaurant has had worse flooding other times in the past year, Denney said. The standing water and the occasional interruption, she added, is just part of living on the coast.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

It's a lesson learned the hard way - Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned that isolated areas could see up to 25 inches of rain from Debby.\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no fatalities have been reported so far, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00c3j\u00c3 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon following severe storms there, according to PowerOutage.us. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said.\n\nAct 2 was to arrive overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bands develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday afternoon, 55 miles east-southeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died because of the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the Brown Dog Deli closed early Monday and couldn't open Tuesday due to a curfew decreed by local officials. On Wednesday the lunch crowd poured in after days of storm preparations and hunkering down. The first words from the person answering the phone were: \"Yes, we're open.\"\n\n\"We've got a lot of locals walking in after being cooped up for two days looking for a good meal,\" kitchen manager Liz Denney said.\n\nSome water got around the sandbags that employees placed Monday, but the restaurant has had worse flooding other times in the past year, Denney said. The standing water and the occasional interruption, she added, is just part of living on the coast.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"},

Meahwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey have also experienced heavy rains connected to the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby is makes landfall again, could cause problems into weekend\n\nTropical Storm Debby is heading up the East Coast as it has made landfall for a second time. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAs Debby drenches South Carolina, heavy rainfall from the tropical storm is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nAt least four dams breached by floodwaters in eastern Georgia county\n\nIn Bulloch County northwest of Savannah, Georgia, at least four dams have been breached by floodwaters, but so far no fatalities have been reported, authorities said at a Wednesday news briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county's director of emergency management. About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFrequent floods are part of life along the water\n\nGene Taylor was waiting for a few inches of water to drain back out of his home as high tide passed Wednesday afternoon at his home along French Quarter Creek, not far from the Cooper River in Huger and about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston.\n\nThis is the fourth time his home's been flooded in the past nine years, and he heeded the warnings this time, moving things up or out.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home -- a common annoyance now.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as Tropical Storm Debby's rainfall drains out to sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia have neared 18 feet, surpassing previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nSouth Carolina's drama is still playing out\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported from Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bans develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

It is now a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain forecast, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDays of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it.

It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia.

A part of Interstate 95 around Fayetteville, North Carolina, was shut down after water topped the freeway, the North Carolina Highway Patrol said. Troopers gave no indication of when the interstate could reopen.\n\nAt least 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain have fallen in the area since Debby first started crawling toward the region.\n\nAn average of more than 50,000 vehicles a day pass through the stretch of I-95, the freeway that connects Florida to Maine.\n\nDebby spawns apparent tornado in North Carolina that damages homes, church and school\n\nAn apparent tornado spawned as Debby's outer bands blew through North Carolina damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.\n\nThe county said in a statement the tornado touched down around 3 a.m. Thursday.

The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAs Debby drenches South Carolina, heavy rainfall from the tropical storm is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nAt least four dams breached by floodwaters in eastern Georgia county\n\nIn Bulloch County northwest of Savannah, Georgia, at least four dams have been breached by floodwaters, but so far no fatalities have been reported, authorities said at a Wednesday news briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county's director of emergency management. About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is expected to return to land over an already soggy South Carolina coast early Thursday before picking up speed and moving north.\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Parts of eastern South Carolina have already seen 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain, while parts of southeast North Carolina have recorded 15 inches (38 centimeters).\n\nDebby, which first made landfall in Florida early Monday and has moved slowly ever since, will speed up as it heads to the north and north-northeast across the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic states later Thursday and on Friday.\n\nHeavy rainfall is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nDays of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday night, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east-northeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

No injuries were immediately reported.\n\nThe storm could bring more tornadoes as the day goes on in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said.\n\nDebby on Wednesday influenced thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes. And the National Weather Service's office in Charleston said survey teams earlier confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nDebby makes landfall again and could cause problems into weekend\n\nTropical Storm Debby is heading up the East Coast as it has made landfall for a second time. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAs Debby drenches South Carolina, heavy rainfall from the tropical storm is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nAt least four dams breached by floodwaters in eastern Georgia county\n\nIn Bulloch County northwest of Savannah, Georgia, at least four dams have been breached by floodwaters, but so far no fatalities have been reported, authorities said at a Wednesday news briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county's director of emergency management. About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County.

And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home -- a common annoyance now.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it.

Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bans develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAs Debby drenches South Carolina, heavy rainfall from the tropical storm is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nAt least four dams breached by floodwaters in eastern Georgia county\n\nIn Bulloch County northwest of Savannah, Georgia, at least four dams have been breached by floodwaters, but so far no fatalities have been reported, authorities said at a Wednesday news briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county's director of emergency management. About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County.

And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us.

You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as Tropical Storm Debby's rainfall drains out to sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia have neared 18 feet, surpassing previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nSouth Carolina's drama is still playing out\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported from Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bans develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nDebby spawned damaging tornadoes, flooded a town and temporarily shut down part of Interstate 95 early Thursday as it blew into North Carolina after making a second landfall overnight.\n\nThe storm was expected to churn up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of flooding rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It was still a tropical storm Thursday morning, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nDebby wasn't done flooding parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina, and an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain is possible as the storm moves north, raising concerns of flash floods in mountainous areas of West Virginia.\n\nDebby also could bring more tornadoes Thursday in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said. At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said. No injuries were immediately reported.\n\nStanding water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny town of Bladenboro, where deputies posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree and washed out roads.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. He had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nThe neighbors on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend.

You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as Tropical Storm Debby's rainfall drains out to sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia have neared 18 feet, surpassing previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported from Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far.

It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned that isolated areas could see up to 25 inches of rain from Debby. Additionally, the National Weather Service's office in Charleston said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no fatalities have been reported so far, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" said Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Ga., the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said.\n\nAct 2 was to arrive overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bands develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday evening, about 40 miles east-southeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Fla., whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nIn Charleston, S.C., the Brown Dog Deli closed early Monday and couldn't open Tuesday due to a curfew decreed by local officials. On Wednesday, the lunch crowd poured in after days of storm preparations and hunkering down. The first words from the person answering the phone were: \"Yes, we're open.\"\n\n\"We've got a lot of locals walking in after being cooped up for two days looking for a good meal,\" kitchen manager Liz Denney said.\n\nSome water got around the sandbags that employees placed Monday, but the restaurant has had worse flooding other times in the past year, Denney said. The standing water and the occasional interruption, she added, is just part of living on the coast.\n\n\"It comes with the territory,\" Denney said.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Russ Bynum, Bruce Shipkowski and Jeff Martin of The Associated Press.\n\nGene Taylor clean up around his house in the historic district of French Quarter Creek as flood waters recede from Tropical Storm Debby, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024, in Huger, S.C.

Its second landfall of the week came near Bulls Bay, South Carolina around 2 a.m.\n\nAs of 8 a.m., its center was located about 65 miles west-northwest of Myrtle Beach, S.C. and 90 miles north of Charleston, S.C. with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph moving northwest at 7 mph.

No injuries were immediately reported. Debby could bring more tornadoes Thursday in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said.\n\nFlooding from heavy rains closed a major freeway along the East Coast. Interstate 95 near Fayetteville, North Carolina, was shut down before sunrise Thursday and officials did not say when that portion of the freeway linking Florida to Maine would be reopened.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby spawned damaging tornadoes, flooded a town and temporarily shut down part of Interstate 95 early Thursday as it blew into North Carolina after making a second landfall overnight.\n\nThe storm was expected to churn up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of flooding rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It was still a tropical storm Thursday morning, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nDebby wasn't done flooding parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina, and an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain is possible as the storm moves north, raising concerns of flash floods in mountainous areas of West Virginia.\n\nDebby also could bring more tornadoes Thursday in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said. At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said. No injuries were immediately reported.\n\nStanding water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny town of Bladenboro, where deputies posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree and washed out roads.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. He had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nThe neighbors on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to total rainfall amounts for the Carolinas.\n\n___\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

The National Hurricane Center warned that isolated areas could see up to 25 inches of rain from Debby.\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no fatalities were reported so far, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the moisture from Debby strengthened another storm system, which caused strong thunderstorms across the Great Lakes and in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some New York City neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Water rescues were reported in the city and surrounding areas.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers were without power in Ohio by Wednesday afternoon after storms there, according to PowerOutage.us. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nYet still, the most rain from Debby so far fell in the South.\n\nA spot near Lake City in north Florida led the nation in total rainfall from Debby at a whopping 19.67 inches, according to the national Weather Prediction Center.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said the state was entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" he said of heavy rains that damaged more than 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday, when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bands develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAnother area of concern Wednesday was southeastern North Carolina, where Hurricane Matthew caused a historic billion-dollar flood in 2016. Two years later, Hurricane Florence broke many of those records. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nThe National Weather Service said up to 9 inches of rain could fall west of Wilmington, North Carolina, in areas that already saw heavy rains overnight.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations for the storm without declaring a state of emergency.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday afternoon, east-southeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said. The tropical storm could make a second landfall in either North Carolina or South Carolina, expected late Wednesday or early Thursday.\n\nDebby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAt least six people died because of the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nCharleston, South Carolina, officials lifted a curfew Wednesday after heavy rains that caused flooding and closed dozens of roads Monday and Tuesday. The city experiences floods several times a year due to rising sea levels.\n\nThe lunch crowd poured into the Brown Dog Deli in downtown Charleston after two days of preparing and hunkering down for Tropical Storm Debby.\n\n\"We've got a lot of locals walking in after being cooped up for two days looking for a good meal,\" said Liz Denney, the kitchen manager for the deli, which sells sandwiches and sides.\n\nThe restaurant does flood, and a little water got around the sandbags employees put up Monday, but it has seen worse flooding other times in the past year, Denney said.\n\nThe deli closed early Monday and couldn't open Tuesday because of Charleston's curfew. Denney said the standing water and occasional interruptions are just part of living on the coast.\n\n\"It comes with the territory,\" Denney said.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news",

Meanwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey have also experienced heavy rains associated with the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nHere's the latest news:\n\nTropical Storm Debby is headed toward the East Coast, where it made its second landfall. The National Hurricane Center reports that Debby made landfall early Thursday morning near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to continue moving inland, spreading heavy rains and possible flooding into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nAs Debby batters South Carolina, the tropical storm's heavy rains are also expected to cause flooding in parts of the Mid-Atlantic states and the Northeastern United States through Saturday morning.\n\nAt least four dams have been breached by floodwaters in Bulloch County, northwest of Savannah, Georgia, but no fatalities have been reported so far, authorities said at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county's emergency management director. About 100 roads are closed, he said.\n\n\"We're faced with a lot of things that we've never faced before,\" said commission chairman Roy Thompson. \"I'm 78 and older and I've never seen anything like this in Bulloch County. It's amazing what happened, and amazing what's going to continue to happen until all this water is gone.\"\n\nGene Taylor waited for a few inches of water to flow out of his house Wednesday afternoon as the tide came in at his home on French Quarter Creek, just off the Cooper River in Huger and about 15 miles northeast of Charleston.\n\nIt's the fourth time his house has flooded in the last nine years, and this time he's heeded the warnings and moved everything upstairs or outside.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past that it's better to be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we've had it,\" Taylor said. \"We were caught in 2015 with our pants around our ankles. We waited, not thinking the water would rise that fast. But it did, and it caught us off guard. We couldn't even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about eight inches of water entered his home, a common problem now.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as rainfall from Tropical Storm Debby drains into the sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia, is nearly 18 feet high, surpassing the previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported in Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering the second act of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things haven't been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of the heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged more than 60 homes but caused no significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is tonight into Thursday, when Debby makes landfall again, bringing heavy rain, this time to the northern coast and inland. Another 4 to 8 inches of rain is possible, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as disastrous as what we said, but we still think these rain bans could linger in the same area for a long time, cause a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final phase could occur next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding in rivers flowing to the Atlantic Ocean.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [],

(AP) -- One person died in a home damaged by a tornado, Wilson County, N.C. authorities said Thursday, raising Tropical Storm Debby's death toll to 7.\n\nThe person was killed in Lucama, North Carolina, Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email. No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nHUGER, S.C. (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby spawned damaging tornadoes, flooded a town and temporarily shut down part of Interstate 95 early Thursday as it blew into North Carolina after making a second landfall overnight.\n\nThe storm was expected to churn up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of flooding rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It was still a tropical storm Thursday morning, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nDebby wasn't done flooding parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina, and an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain is possible as the storm moves north, raising concerns of flash floods in mountainous areas of West Virginia.\n\nDebby also could bring more tornadoes Thursday in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said. At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said. No injuries were immediately reported.\n\nStanding water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny town of Bladenboro, where deputies posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree and washed out roads.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. He had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nThe neighbors on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to total rainfall amounts for the Carolinas.\n\n___\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

(AP) - Tropical Storm Debby is expected to return to land over an already soggy South Carolina coast early Thursday before picking up speed and moving north.\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Parts of eastern South Carolina have already seen 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain, while parts of southeast North Carolina have recorded 15 inches (38 centimeters).\n\nDebby, which first made landfall in Florida early Monday and has moved slowly ever since, will speed up as it heads to the north and north-northeast across the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic states later Thursday and on Friday.\n\nHeavy rainfall is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nDays of rain have forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday. The National Weather Service\u00b4s office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nKeon Johnson and his wife Zyla Johnson, left, talk about how to get to work since his house on Tappan Zee Drive that was flooded on Monday from Tropical Storm Debby, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024, in Pooler, Ga. (AP Photo/Stephen B. Morton)\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It\u00b4s a lesson learned the hard way - Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we\u00b4ve learned from the past it\u00b4s better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don\u00b4t get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It\u00b4s part of living on the creek.\"\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We\u00b4ve been faced with a lot of things we\u00b4ve never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I\u00b4m 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It\u00b4s amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn\u00b4t seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment\u00b4s notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy\u00b4s Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday night, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east-northeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina. Associated Press journalists Russ Bynum in Pooler, Georgia; Bruce Shipkowski in Toms River, New Jersey; Jeff Martin in Atlanta, and Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington, contributed.\n\nGene Taylor clean up around his house in the historic district of French Quarter Creek as flood waters recede from Tropical Storm Debby, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024, in Huger, S.C.

Meahwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey have also experienced heavy rains connected to the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby is makes landfall again, could cause problems into weekend\n\nTropical Storm Debby is heading up the East Coast as it has made landfall for a second time. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAs Debby drenches South Carolina, heavy rainfall from the tropical storm is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nAt least four dams breached by floodwaters in eastern Georgia county\n\nIn Bulloch County northwest of Savannah, Georgia, at least four dams have been breached by floodwaters, but so far no fatalities have been reported, authorities said at a Wednesday news briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county's director of emergency management. About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFrequent floods are part of life along the water\n\nGene Taylor was waiting for a few inches of water to drain back out of his home as high tide passed Wednesday afternoon at his home along French Quarter Creek, not far from the Cooper River in Huger and about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston.\n\nThis is the fourth time his home's been flooded in the past nine years, and he heeded the warnings this time, moving things up or out.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home -- a common annoyance now.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as Tropical Storm Debby's rainfall drains out to sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia have neared 18 feet, surpassing previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nSouth Carolina's drama is still playing out\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported from Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bans develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

It was still a tropical storm Thursday morning, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nDebby wasn't done flooding parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina, and an additional three to nine inches of rain is possible as the storm moves north, raising concerns of flash floods in mountainous areas of Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nDebby also could bring more tornadoes Thursday in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said. At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.\n\nOne person died in a home damaged by the tornado in Lucama, North Carolina, Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email. No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as six inches (15 centimetres) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighbourhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least seven people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby spawned damaging tornadoes, flooded a town and temporarily shut down part of Interstate 95 early Thursday as it blew into North Carolina after making a second landfall overnight.\n\nThe storm was expected to churn up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of flooding rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It was still a tropical storm Thursday morning, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nPeople are also reading...

At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said. No injuries were immediately reported.\n\nStanding water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny town of Bladenboro, where deputies posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree and washed out roads.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. He had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe neighbors on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nThis story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to total rainfall amounts for the Carolinas.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

Meahwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey have also experienced heavy rains connected to the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby is makes landfall again, could cause problems into weekend\n\nTropical Storm Debby is heading up the East Coast as it has made landfall for a second time. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAs Debby drenches South Carolina, heavy rainfall from the tropical storm is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nAt least four dams breached by floodwaters in eastern Georgia county\n\nIn Bulloch County northwest of Savannah, Georgia, at least four dams have been breached by floodwaters, but so far no fatalities have been reported, authorities said at a Wednesday news briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county's director of emergency management. About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFrequent floods are part of life along the water\n\nGene Taylor was waiting for a few inches of water to drain back out of his home as high tide passed Wednesday afternoon at his home along French Quarter Creek, not far from the Cooper River in Huger and about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston.\n\nThis is the fourth time his home's been flooded in the past nine years, and he heeded the warnings this time, moving things up or out.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home -- a common annoyance now.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as Tropical Storm Debby's rainfall drains out to sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia have neared 18 feet, surpassing previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nSouth Carolina's drama is still playing out\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported from Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bans develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby spawned damaging tornadoes that killed one person, flooded a town and temporarily shut down part of Interstate 95 early Thursday as it blew into North Carolina after making a second landfall overnight.\n\nThe storm was expected to churn up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of flooding rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It was still a tropical storm Thursday morning, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nDebby wasn't done flooding parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina, and an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain is possible as the storm moves north, raising concerns of flash floods in mountainous areas of Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nDebby also could bring more tornadoes Thursday in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said. At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.\n\nOne person died in a home damaged by the tornado in Lucama, North Carolina, Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email. No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nTheresa Richardson hunkered down with her husband and granddaughter in the closet of their Lucama home as the tornado tore through about a mile away.\n\nDebris struck the house. And they could hear the roof of nearby Springfield Middle School being ripped off. The home of one of her granddaughter's friends was destroyed from the tornado.\n\nRichardson said this wasn't the first time the area was struck by a tornado -- her neighbors call the road they live on \"Tornado Alley.\"\n\nThe superintendent of Wilson County Schools confirmed damage at Springfield Middle School, where sections of the walls and roof of the 6th and 7th grade halls are gone or compromised.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking to see the school right after the event,\" Superintendent Lane Mills said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Lucama, deputies in Bladenboro had posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree as well as roads that had been washed out. Standing water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny North Carolina town.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. He had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nThe neighbors on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least seven people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nThis story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to total rainfall amounts for the Carolinas.\n\nAssociated Press contributors include Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, Russ Bynum in Pooler, Georgia; Bruce Shipkowski in Toms River, New

It is expected to next menace the Southeastern and mid-Atlantic coasts for days.\n\nGovernors in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia have declared states of emergency. The storm has already left neighbourhoods and communities underwater with widespread flooding washing out streets and inundating homes across the region.\n\n\"All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge,\" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said at a briefing at the state's Department of Emergency Management.\n\nOfficials in Charleston, South Carolina, lifted a citywide curfew, saying crews on standby were not needed to conduct any rescues overnight as the worst of the storm passed through.\n\nEven so, the storm could still deliver another 3 to 9 inches of rainfall to the Carolina coast, the National Weather Service said. That would bring rain totals to 25 inches in South Carolina and 15 inches in southeastern North Carolina near Wilmington and coastal Georgia.\n\nDebby was about 40km east-northeast of Charleston late Wednesday and moving about 5km per hour toward the north-northwest, with maximum sustained winds of 60mph. It was forecast to make landfall again further north in South Carolina early Thursday, the National Hurricane Centre said.\n\nDebby's greatest threat remains the sheer volume of rain it is dumping on the Eastern Seaboard and the potential for flooding that could continue into next week. In South Carolina,15 homes had suffered major damage, and one had been destroyed as a result of Debby's flooding.\n\nParts of Virginia were expected to get 3 to 7 inches of rain through Friday, while 2 to 4 inches were forecast for parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania and upstate New York through Saturday, with risks of flash floods, the centre said. \"This is certainly an extreme rainfall event,\" said Neil Dixon, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Charleston, noting that daily rainfall records have already been broken in the area. \"In that respect, the flooding has been something that we haven't seen in many years,\" he added.\n\nEmergency management officials were keeping a close watch as the rainwater drained into the numerous river systems that snake through the Carolinas.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby has made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend.\n\nDebby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It is now a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain forecast, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank. ___ This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to total rainfall amounts for the Carolinas.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

More than 130,000 people have been left without power due to tornado activity, as widespread structure damage has been caused. The tropical storm, which came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina, first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on the Gulf Coast of Florida and temporarily shut down part of Interstate 95.\n\nIn Wilson County, NC, there were even reports of emergency responders searching for a man possibly trapped inside, according to local news outlet ABC11. Meanwhile, three tornado warnings have been issued east of Raleigh, NC, as well as in Dortches and Rocky Mount. This morning, it was still a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nDebby wasn't done flooding parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina, and an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain is possible as the storm moves north, raising concerns of flash floods in mountainous areas of West Virginia . At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said. No injuries were immediately reported. Standing water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny town of Bladenboro, where deputies posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree and washed out roads.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. He had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed. \"We\u00b4ve been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nThe neighbors on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler , west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes . Located roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn\u00b4t seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer. \"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city. About 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems. The final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency. At least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

(AP) -- Days of rain forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Tropical Storm Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned that isolated areas could see up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain from Debby. Additionally, the National Weather Service's office in Charleston said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County.

Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said.\n\nAct 2 was to arrive overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bands develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday evening, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east-southeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the Brown Dog Deli closed early Monday and couldn't open Tuesday due to a curfew decreed by local officials. On Wednesday the lunch crowd poured in after days of storm preparations and hunkering down. The first words from the person answering the phone were: \"Yes, we're open.\"\n\n\"We've got a lot of locals walking in after being cooped up for two days looking for a good meal,\" kitchen manager Liz Denney said.\n\nSome water got around the sandbags that employees placed Monday, but the restaurant has had worse flooding other times in the past year, Denney said. The standing water and the occasional interruption, she added, is just part of living on the coast.\n\n\"It comes with the territory,\" Denney said.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

Meanwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey have also experienced heavy rains connected to the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nDebby spawns apparent tornado in North Carolina that damages homes, church and school\n\nAn apparent tornado spawned as Debby's outer bands blew through North Carolina damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe county said in a statement the tornado touched down around 3 a.m. Thursday. No injuries were immediately reported.\n\nThe storm could bring more tornadoes as the day goes on in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said.\n\nDebby on Wednesday influenced thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes. And the National Weather Service's office in Charleston said survey teams earlier confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nDebby makes landfall again and could cause problems into weekend\n\nTropical Storm Debby is heading up the East Coast as it has made landfall for a second time. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAs Debby drenches South Carolina, heavy rainfall from the tropical storm is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nAt least four dams breached by floodwaters in eastern Georgia county\n\nIn Bulloch County northwest of Savannah, Georgia, at least four dams have been breached by floodwaters, but so far no fatalities have been reported, authorities said at a Wednesday news briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county's director of emergency management. About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFrequent floods are part of life along the water\n\nGene Taylor was waiting for a few inches of water to drain back out of his home as high tide passed Wednesday afternoon at his home along French Quarter Creek, not far from the Cooper River in Huger and about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThis is the fourth time his home's been flooded in the past nine years, and he heeded the warnings this time, moving things up or out.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home -- a common annoyance now.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as Tropical Storm Debby's rainfall drains out to sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia have neared 18 feet, surpassing previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSouth Carolina's drama is still playing out\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported from Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bans develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

However, with the storm slowing down even more, Debby will stay stuck over the Southeast for the better part of this week, meandering over Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nEven though the storm is expected to weaken a bit more overnight, Debby is still expected to bring historic rainfall and life-threatening flooding to portions of southeastern Georgia and the coastal areas of the Carolinas over the next few days. Rainfall totals from this event are expected to reach between 10 and 20 inches.\n\nAlready, portions of southeastern Georgia and South Carolina have seen between 3 to 6 inches of rainfall, but with rainfall rates of 1.5 to 3 inches per hour possible, flood alerts remain in effect.\n\nA Flash Flood Warning was issued for Charleston, South Carolina, where rainfall rates between 1.5 and 2.5 inches are expected. Ongoing or new flooding is expected, with an additional 2 to 4 inches of rain possible over the next few hours.\n\nAs onshore flow continues, storm surge remains an issue in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. Storm surge alerts remain in effect up the Georgia and Carolina coastlines.\n\nRainfall aside, Debby could also generate some spin-up tornadoes as it swirls over the Georgia-South Carolina border tonight. As a result, a Tornado Watch also remains in effect for parts of southeastern Georgia and South Carolina until 1 a.m. ET.\n\nOver the next 48 hours, Debby is expected to meander back over the Atlantic but will continue to hug the coastline before heading back inland over the Carolinas again. Slight strengthening can't entirely be ruled out as it moves back over water, but ultimately, Debby is expected to weaken once it moves back inland. Strength aside, it will still bring significant rainfall to portions of the Southeast, which will likely lead to catastrophic flooding in some areas.\n\nDebby is expected to eventually drift toward the north/northeast by the end of the week into the weekend. As it heads north, it will likely weaken to a tropical depression or remnant low. Regardless, heavy rainfall is still expected up the I-95 corridor heading into this weekend.\n\nPower returns to some Florida customers as Debby moves northeast\n\nAs of Monday evening, 146,034 customers are without power in Florida, according to the latest update from a U.S. power outage map.\n\nThis marks an improvement from Monday morning, which saw nearly 300,000 customers without power at 9:50 a.m. ET, the height of outages across the state.\n\nDuring a press conference in Tallahassee Monday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state's emergency department had 17,000 linemen working to restore power in the wake of the storm.\n\n\"We have a lot of restoration personnel ready to go,\" DeSantis said.\n\nDebby weakening, but threats of tornadoes, heavy rain continue\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to weaken, with maximum sustained winds down to 45 mph as of 8 p.m. ET. The weather pattern is moving very slowly to the northeast at 6 mph, and the center is currently about 50 miles east of Valdosta, Georgia.\n\nEven though Debby is now inland and continues to weaken, many of the impacts -- especially the heavy rainfall and dangerous flash flood threat -- will not abate for several days. For many locations in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the worst is yet to come.\n\nThe tornado threat continues along portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts this evening and into tonight. A Tornado Watch remains in effect from Savannah, Georgia, to Charleston, South Carolina, until at least 1 a.m. ET.\n\nParts of Florida, including Sarasota and Lakewood Ranch, are reporting over a foot of rain from Debby, and portions of Suwannee County, including Live Oak, are getting around a foot as well.\n\nSo far, parts of Georgia, including Savannah, are reporting nearly 4'' of rain. The same can be said for Hilton Head, South Carolina.\n\nConditions will continue to deteriorate across much of South Carolina overnight Monday into Tuesday, with widespread areas of heavy rain and the potential for dangerous, significant flash flooding during nighttime hours.\n\nCoastal flooding and storm surges will continue to increase in the coming hours as winds increase and more persistent heavy rain moves in, heading into high tide along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts.\n\nBy late Tuesday afternoon or early evening, the center of Debby will likely be moving off the Southeast coast and into the Atlantic, where it will meander for about 24 hours before likely turning back toward the coast and potentially making another landfall as a tropical storm somewhere along the South Carolina coast by Thursday morning or afternoon.\n\nMore than 163,000 customers without power in Florida\n\nMore than 163,000 customers are without power in Florida, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks energy outages.\n\nCurfew set for Charleston, South Carolina\n\nA curfew will go into effect overnight for Charleston, South Carolina, due to Debby, city officials said Monday.\n\nThoroughfares leading into the peninsula will be closed from 11 p.m. ET Monday to noon ET Tuesday, the city said, as the region braces for potential impacts such as tropical storm-force winds, heavy rain and isolated tornadoes.\n\n\"We urge everybody to stay inside, stay indoors and do not travel,\" Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a press briefing Monday evening.\n\nBiden approves emergency declaration request from South Carolina\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration in the state due to Debby, the White House said.\n\nThe declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency to mobilize and provide equipment and resources necessary.\n\n\"The President continues to urge residents to remain vigilant and heed the warnings of State and local officials,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nNorth Carolina governor declares state of emergency\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency ahead of severe weather, including life-threatening flash flooding, expected across the state due to Debby.\n\n\"This weather has the potential to bring intense rain and flooding to North Carolina and we are preparing for it,\" Cooper said in a statement. \"As the weather becomes more severe, I urge everyone to take precautions and stay safe.\"\n\nThe emergency declaration will allow for the state to mobilize resources to respond to the storm.\n\nTropical Storm Debby slowing down as it moves across US\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to weaken and slow down in forward speed as the center moves near the Florida-Georgia state line as of 5 p.m. ET.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are down to 50 mph, and Debby is moving to the northeast at 6 mph. The center is currently about 30 miles southeast of Valdosta, Georgia.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, all tropical weather and storm surge alerts have been canceled across Florida's Gulf Coast as conditions improve across much of the state.\n\nDebby will move across southeastern Georgia through Monday evening, with the worst impacts focused there and into the Jacksonville, Florida, area. Heavy rain continues to overspread southern South Carolina as well.\n\nMore than 199,000 customers are without power in Florida, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks energy outages.\n\nLatest forecast\n\nDebby is moving inland across north Florida Monday afternoon after dumping more than 1 foot of rain in the state.\n\nTornadoes are possible Monday afternoon in Florida, including in Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville, as well as in the coastal cities of Savannah, Georgia, and Beaufort, South Carolina.\n\nThe biggest concern this week is flash flooding from the widespread, relentless rain. A flash flood emergency remains in effect in Suwannee County, Florida, northwest of Gainesville, where 10 to 15 inches of rain has fallen so far.\n\nDebby will slowly churn into southeastern Georgia throughout Monday afternoon and evening. Conditions will deteriorate in Savannah, Georgia, throughout the day.\n\nAt least four people have been killed from Debby, authorities said.\n\n13-year-old boy was killed when a tree fell on a mobile home Monday morning in Levy County, Florida, which encompasses Cedar Key, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with this family as they deal with this tragedy,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement. \"We encourage everyone to use extreme caution as they begin to assess and clean up the damage. Downed powerlines and falling trees are among the many hazards.\"\n\nIn Hillsborough County, Florida, which encompasses Tampa, a driver of a semi was killed when the truck went into a canal off Interstate 275 Monday morning, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.\n\nDeputies recovered the semi and found the driver dead inside the cab, authorities said.\n\n\"It's just heartbreaking,\" Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told ABC News Live. \"We really ask everyone, one, to be aware of the weather situations in your area, and then heed the warnings. Especially the high wind and the water.\"\n\nIn Dixie County, Florida, a driver \"lost control due to the inclement weather and wet roadway\" on Sunday night, crashing into the center median guardrail and then overturning the car, the Florida Highway Patrol said.\n\nThe driver, a 38-year-old woman, and a passenger, a 12-year-old boy, were killed, authorities said.\n\nAnother passenger, a 14-year-old boy, was seriously injured, the highway patrol said.\n\nFlash flood emergency issued in Suwannee County, Florida\n\nA flash flood emergency has been issued in Suwannee County in north Florida, northwest of Gainesville, where officials are reporting that water is entering structures.\n\nTen to 15 inches of rain has inundated the county so far and another 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights have been canceled within, into or out of the U.S. on Monday, and that number is expected to continue to climb.\n\nAmerican Airlines is seeing the biggest impacts because of its hubs in Miami and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nAmerican Airlines said it canceled operations at airports in Gainesville, Sarasota and Tallahassee until noon on Monday.\n\nSunday was one of the worst air travel days of the year with more than 2,400 cancellations.\n\nBiden briefed on storm\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed Monday morning on the administration's ongoing response to Debby, according to a White House official.\n\nOn Saturday, Biden approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and deployed rescue personnel, meals and water, the official said.\n\nThe Biden administration is in touch with officials from Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.

Ron DeSantis warned Monday.\n\nSignificant flooding has already impacted the Bradenton and Sarasota County area up to North Florida, he said.\n\nMore than 250,000 customers without power in Florida\n\nMore than 250,000 customers are without power in Florida Monday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks energy outages.\n\nDebby makes landfall in Florida\n\nHurricane Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers without power in Florida, tracker says\n\nMore than 135,000 customers were without power in Florida early Monday, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks energy outages.\n\nDebby approaches landfall with 80 mph winds\n\nHurricane Debby is \"very near\" landfall along Florida's Gulf Coast, the National Hurricane Center said at 5 a.m. ET.\n\n\"Expected to bring life-threatening storm surge in portions of Florida and major flooding in the southeastern United States,\" the center said in an update.\n\nThe Category 1 storm had maximum sustained winds of an about 80 mph as it approached Big Bend, a northern area near the Panhandle, the center said.\n\nDebby strengthens, with maximum sustained winds up to 80 mph\n\nHurricane Debby continued to strengthen, with maximum sustained winds rising to 80 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nMore than 10 inches of rain fell on the west coast of Florida, around the Tampa Bay area, where water rescues have been on going near Clearwater. Significant flooding also has been reported in Fort Myers area.\n\nStorm surge has been rising quickly now along the Big Bend area in Florida, from Cedar Key to Keaton Beach, where up to 10 feet of Gulf water could inundate the coastline. The storm is forecast to make landfall in that area on Monday morning.\n\nCoast Guard rescues two adrift in sailboat off Florida coast\n\nTwo people were rescued Sunday from a boat that was adrift in about 20-foot seas off the coast of Boca Grande, Florida, the U.S. Coast Guard said.\n\nThe boaters were airlifted from their 34-foot sailboat after the vessel lost its sail about 73 miles off shore, the guard said.\n\nThe sailboat had been on course for Tarpon Springs from Key West, officials said. A friend of the boaters contacted the Coast Guard at about 5 p.m. Saturday, telling officials they had missed their check-in.\n\n\"We received an updated satellite position from the boaters' friend, which led to them being successfully located,\" Lt. Cmdr. Christopher Hooper, a search and rescue mission coordinator, said in a statement.\n\nThe boaters were rescued by a crew on an Air Station Clearwater MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter at about 11 a.m. on Sunday, the Coast Guard said. They had been adrift in seas that were between 15 and 20 feet, with wind speeds at about 50 knots. Visibility was low.\n\nThe names of the people on the boat were not released.\n\nDebby strengthens into a hurricane\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has upgraded Tropical Storm Debby to a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 75 mph.\n\nThe forecast is still on track for more strengthening overnight as Debby feeds off the warm water in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Water temperatures running 3 to 5 degrees above average are providing plenty of fuel for this storm to intensify before landfall, which will happen around 7 a.m. ET along the Big Bend region of Florida.\n\nTropical Storm Debby nearing hurricane strength at 70 mph\n\nWhile still a tropical storm, Debby is nearing hurricane strength, producing maximum sustained wind speeds up to 70 mph.\n\nDebby will continue to intensify rapidly overnight as it travels northward over the Gulf's warm waters. It is forecast to become a hurricane tonight. It is expected to strengthen to at least a strong Category 1 hurricane before making landfall along Florida's Big Bend region Monday morning (around 7 a.m. ET), producing sustained wind speeds near 85 mph and wind gusts reaching over 100 mph possible.\n\nLocated about 90 miles southwest of Cedar Key, Florida, the storm continues to impact the Florida Gulf Coast with heavy rainfall, storm surge, powerful winds and even spin-up tornadoes.\n\nA reported wind gust of 56 mph was reported in St. Petersburg, with two tornadoes reported in central Florida.\n\nA 60-mph wind gust was also reported near Sarasota, Florida.\n\nNumerous reports of flooding from heavy rainfall and surges have also been submitted up Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nThe Tornado Watch covering much of northern and central Florida and southern Georgia has been extended until 6 a.m. ET on Monday.\n\nOnce Debby moves over land, it will weaken. However, the lack of a steering current will cause the storm to slow down considerably. While its exact track remains questionable, model guidance suggests the storm will drift over the Atlantic or Southeast coastline late Monday night into Tuesday before meandering back over Georgia and the Carolinas. Interaction with the Atlantic could reenergize Debby, but that will greatly depend on the storm's path.\n\nEven though Debby's track and timing remain uncertain later this week, there is high confidence that it will bring historic rainfall and significant flooding across portions of the Southeast.\n\nRainfall ranging between 6 to 12 inches is possible from Florida's Big Bend region through southeastern Georgia and into the Carolinas. Parts of coastal Georgia and South Carolina will be in the bullseye for the heaviest rainfall. There, widespread totals between 10 to 20 inches are possible, with some places even seeing up to 30 inches locally. Because of this, significant urban and river flooding is anticipated.\n\nRainfall aside, hurricane and tropical storm force winds will continue to whip across Florida and will likely intensify Sunday night into Monday as the storm moves closer to the coast -- with areas just south and east of the storm's eyewall seeing the strongest gusts early Monday morning.\n\nStorm surge will also worsen along Florida's northern and central Gulf coast tonight into Monday morning, with the highest surge expected between Suwannee River and Ochlockonee River (6 to 10 feet).\n\nAll tropical alerts remain unchanged from the last update.\n\nTropical Storm Debby on track to become a hurricane overnight\n\nAs of 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, Tropical Storm Debby still has winds of 65 mph and is forecast to undergo rapid intensification into a hurricane overnight, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDebby is expected to make landfall as a hurricane in Florida's Big Bend region on Monday morning around 7 a.m.\n\nRain is expected to be the most impactful element from this storm, affecting a wide area over an extended period of time.\n\n\"Across portions of southeast Georgia and South Carolina, 10 to 20 inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected through Friday morning,\" the National Hurricane Center said. \"This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding.\"\n\nEvacuations ordered in Alachua County, Florida, as Debby set to make landfall\n\nAn evacuation order was issued Sunday for residents of Alachua County, Florida, residing in mobile homes, manufactured homes and recreational vehicles ahead of the arrival of Debby, which is forecast to be a hurricane when it makes landfall on Monday.\n\nPeople living in areas close to rivers and lakes, and low-lying areas that tend to flood in Alachua County are also encouraged to evacuate, according to a statement issued by county officials.\n\nGainesville is the largest city in Alachua County.\n\n\"We encourage residents affected to find alternative housing with friends, family or short-term rentals,\" according to the county's statement.\n\nAlachua County is opening three shelters for residents in need.\n\nTornado watch issued as Debby runs parallel to Florida's Gulf Coast\n\nA tornado watch was issued Sunday afternoon by the National Weather Service as Tropical Storm Debbie moved northward in the Gulf of Mexico parallel to Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nAt 2 p.m. Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said Debby was still a tropical storm with winds of 65 mph and forecasted to bring severe weather, including heavy rain, to coastal communities Sunday afternoon.\n\nA tornado watch is in effect for much of Florida through Sunday evening.\n\nDebby is expected to become a hurricane Sunday evening and will likely make landfall sometime between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. Monday in the Big Bend area of Florida's Panhandle.\n\nOnce Debby makes landfall, the storm is expected to slow down and essentially stall over the Southeast, dropping potentially historic amounts of rainfall as it moves into Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for the west coast of Florida from the Ochlockonee River southwest of Tallahassee to the Suwannee River northwest of Gainesville.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights canceled due to Debby and Northeast thunderstorms\n\nTropical Storm Debby and thunderstorms in the Northeast were causing airlines to cancel or delay flights on Sunday.\n\nAmerican Airlines said it canceled 601 flights, or about 16% of its flights, on Sunday, the most of any airline.\n\nDebby, now a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico, is expected to make landfall around the Big Bend area of the Florida Panhandle on Monday morning as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlso causing delays and cancellations were severe thunderstorms moving up the East Coast. Parts of the mid-Atlantic states are under a severe thunderstorm watch until 9 p.m. ET Sunday, including the cities of Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City.\n\nThe most flights canceled on Sunday were at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, where 214 flights were canceled and another 172 were delayed, according to FlightAware.\n\nIn New York City, LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy international airports reported a combined 363 flights canceled and 258 delayed on Sunday.\n\nMiami International Airport reported 209 canceled flights and 151 delayed fights.

Ron DeSantis.\n\nWidespread flooding is expected for the Florida Panhandle region, particularly in the Big Bend area where Debby is expected to make landfall Monday morning as a category 1 hurricane, DeSantis said during a news conference Sunday morning.\n\nDeSantis said the Florida National Guard and the state's Emergency Response Team are prepared to conduct search-and-rescue and provide humanitarian assistance.\n\n\"The Florida National Guard is standing by with 3,000 service members ready to assist the state Emergency Response Team, which includes search-and-rescue, route clearance, commodity distribution and protection of critical infrastructure,\" DeSantis said.\n\nThe governor said at least 12 swift boat crews and flat-bottom jon boat crews are also standing by to help with rescues.\n\nHe said that more than 30,000 bottles of water, more than 160,000 meals and nearly 14,000 tarps have been pre-staged in parts of Florida that are expected to be hit hard by the storm.\n\nDeSantis said Florida utility companies have notified up to 17,000 linemen to be ready to spring into action once it is safe to repair any damage.\n\nFlooding forecast as Debby expected to bring up to 20 inches of rain\n\nFlorida residents in the Big Bend region of the Panhandle were warned Sunday that Debby is going to bring \"catastrophic rain to the area\" that will cause flooding and power outages.\n\nKevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said during a news conference on Sunday that once the Debby makes landfall as a possible Category 1 hurricane on Monday morning, winds will subside quickly, but the slow-moving storm will produce an abundance of rain.\n\n\"We're going to be in a catastrophic rain situation where we have situations in Florida that will receive 15, maybe as high as 20 inches of rain,\" Guthrie said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis told residents who are in the path of the storm to expect widespread power outages.\n\n\"It's possible that you could have serious intensification between now and landfall. It could get up to 85, 90 and 95 mph sustained winds. That is absolutely possible, particularly in parts of the state like here in Tallahassee. There's going to be a lot of trees that are going to fall down and you're going to have debris. You are going to have power interruptions,\" the governor said.\n\nGov. DeSantis advises residents to make final preparations for Debby\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis advised residents of the state's Panhandle region on Sunday that they should be finalizing preparations for when Tropical Storm Debby makes its anticipated landfall Monday morning as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\n\"Now this is a storm that is potentially dangerous. Residents should be finalizing all of their preparations now,\" DeSantis said during a news conference at the state's Emergency Operation Center in Tallahassee.\n\nDeSantis said Tropical Storm Debby was in the Gulf of Mexico about 190 miles southwest of Tampa as of Sunday morning with sustained winds of about 50 mph.\n\n\"But those are expected to increase,\" DeSantis said. \"Tropical Storm Debby is likely to become a Category 1 hurricane before making landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida.\"\n\nHe said the storm was on a similar track taken by Hurricane Idalia in 2023. Idalia made landfall in Big Bend on Aug. 30, 2023, as a Category 3 hurricane and caused a devastating storm surge of 7 to 12 feet across the coastal Big Bend region in Levy, Dixie and Taylor counties.\n\n\"This storm is a similar track,\" DeSantis said. \"It may be a tick to the west of that. It very well may have greater impacts here in the Tallahassee region than Hurricane Idalia did. Once it crosses landfall and enters the Florida Panhandle/Big Bend Region, wherever it does, it's going to move very slowly across northern Florida and southeast Georgia.\"", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby spawned damaging tornadoes that killed one person, flooded a town and temporarily shut down part of Interstate 95 early Thursday as it blew into North Carolina after making a second landfall overnight.\n\nThe storm was expected to churn up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of flooding rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It was still a tropical storm Thursday morning, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nDebby wasn't done flooding parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina, and an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain is possible as the storm moves north, raising concerns of flash floods in mountainous areas of Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nDebby also could bring more tornadoes Thursday in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said. At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.\n\nOne person died in a home damaged by the tornado in Lucama, North Carolina, Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email. No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nTheresa Richardson hunkered down with her husband and granddaughter in the closet of their Lucama home as the tornado tore through about a mile away.\n\nDebris struck the house. And they could hear the roof of nearby Springfield Middle School being ripped off. The home of one of her granddaughter's friends was destroyed from the tornado.\n\nRichardson said this wasn't the first time the area was struck by a tornado -- her neighbors call the road they live on \"Tornado Alley.\"\n\nThe superintendent of Wilson County Schools confirmed damage at Springfield Middle School, where sections of the walls and roof of the 6th and 7th grade halls are gone or compromised.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking to see the school right after the event,\" Superintendent Lane Mills said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Lucama, deputies in Bladenboro had posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree as well as roads that had been washed out. Standing water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny North Carolina town.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. He had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nThe neighbors on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least seven people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nThis story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to total rainfall amounts for the Carolinas.\n\nAssociated Press contributors include Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, Russ Bynum in Pooler, Georgia; Bruce Shipkowski in Toms River, New

(WBTV) - The amount and location of rainfall across the Carolinas amid Tropical Storm Debby this week has slightly shifted as of Wednesday.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center on Wednesday, Aug. 7 released updated projections of rain totals and Tropical Storm Debby's trajectory for the next few days. The storm was churning over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday and was expected to make a second landfall in the Carolinas late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning.\n\nIt is possible that the storm may make a second landfall as a hurricane, but it could also reach land as a tropical storm.\n\nRain totals near 30 inches were initially possible in South Carolina near Charleston, according to the National Hurricane Center. Those totals have shifted somewhat as of Wednesday, including for other areas.\n\nHere's what to expect from Tropical Storm Debby, as of data provided Wednesday.\n\nSoutheast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina were projected to see the most rain on Thursday and Friday -- though central Virginia could also see significant rainfall.\n\nParts of northeast South Carolina could see more than 20 inches of rain by Saturday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 9 inches of rainfall with locally higher amounts, leading to maximum storm total amounts as high as 25 inches in South Carolina and 15 inches in southeast North Carolina, broadening the area of considerable flooding across portions of South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday,\" the National Hurricane Center writes.\n\nSoutheast North Carolina near the South Carolina border could receive anywhere from 6-15 inches of rain as the storm moves through, according to a graphic published by the hurricane center. Areas near the Charlotte Metro -- like Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, Union, and York counties -- could see 4-6 inches of rain in the coming days.\n\nCommunities along the southeast North Carolina coast could receive anywhere from 4-12 inches of rain by Saturday night. Much of the southeastern portion of the state is projected to see around 6-8 inches.\n\nRainfall estimates shared in the hurricane center's graphic -- shown below -- may be lower than actual local rainfall totals, officials said.\n\nThe western parts of the Carolinas should see much less rain this week.\n\n---> School closures: Charlotte Metro districts cancel 1st day of class amid Tropical Storm Debby\n\nFlood warnings have been issued for two Charlotte-area counties in South Carolina as Tropical Storm Debby prepares to make a second landfall this week.\n\nFlood warnings were issued for Chesterfield and Lancaster counties in South Carolina starting Thursday, Aug. 8 and Friday, Aug. 9, respectively, due to potentially historic rain totals that could cause flooding.\n\nSee the full flood warning alerts here.\n\nChesterfield and Lancaster counties in South Carolina were specifically at risk of flooding due to excessive rainfall. Flooding of streets, rivers, creeks, streams, and other \"low-lying and flood-prone locations\" will be possible, the National Weather Service reports.\n\nFlash flooding is a particular concern in the Carolinas this week. Flash flooding happens at a quicker rate, and typically dissipates faster than regular flooding events, experts say.\n\nAccording to Kim Stenson, director of the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, the anticipated rainfall could set new records for the state. The many inches of rain could lead to flooding and flash flooding in the state.\n\n\"The heavy rains and flooding currently predicted this week are historic in scope and scale. Our experts with the National Hurricane Center believe flooding to be catastrophic for many parts of South Carolina,\" Stenson said in a statement Monday. \"Take no chances with this storm.\"\n\nFlood watches were also active for several counties in North Carolina and South Carolina near the Charlotte Metro area due to the storm. Flood watches are issued when flooding is possible, while flood warnings are issued when flooding is happening or about to happen.\n\nWeather alerts and warnings were likely active for many other counties in the Carolinas outside of our region.\n\nWhile flooding is a risk across the entire region, storm surge flooding is a particular concern along the coast of the Carolinas.\n\nBoth North and South Carolina are at risk of seeing 1-3 feet of storm surge above ground, according to details posted Wednesday.\n\nWhat is storm surge?\n\nStorm surge is an unusually high water level caused by a storm. Storm surge can cause ocean waters to move much further inland than normal, depending on the severity of the storm.\n\nStorm surge happens because the \"wind circulation around the eye of a hurricane causes a vertical circulation in the ocean,\" according to the National Hurricane Center. When the storm reaches shallow water near the coast, the water can't move downward due to the vertical circulation, which forces the water to move upward and inland, officials said.\n\nStorm surge can travel up rivers and canals , bringing the water well inland, the NHC says. The leading cause of fatalities during hurricanes is storm surge.\n\nA State of Emergency was declared for South Carolina before the storm touched down as a hurricane on Monday. A State of Emergency was also active in North Carolina, as of Monday.\n\nPeople in Debby's path are urged to take the following steps, as shared by the North Carolina governor's office Monday:",

No injuries were immediately reported.\n\nRead More NASA captures wild image of Hurricane Debby from space as deadly storm barrels into Florida\n\nStanding water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny town of Bladenboro, where deputies posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree and washed out roads.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nHe had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"We got caught with our pants down in 2015.

We couldn\u00b4t even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We\u00b4ve been faced with a lot of things we\u00b4ve never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said.\n\n\"I\u00b4m 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County.

Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It was still a tropical storm Thursday morning, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nDebby wasn't done flooding parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina, and an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain is possible as the storm moves north, raising concerns of flash floods in mountainous areas of Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nDebby also could bring more tornadoes Thursday in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said. At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.\n\nOne person died in a home damaged by the tornado in Lucama, North Carolina, Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email. No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nTheresa Richardson hunkered down with her husband and granddaughter in the closet of their Lucama home as the tornado tore through about a mile away.\n\nDebris struck the house. And they could hear the roof of nearby Springfield Middle School being ripped off. The home of one of her granddaughter's friends was destroyed from the tornado.\n\nRichardson said this wasn't the first time the area was struck by a tornado -- her neighbors call the road they live on \"Tornado Alley.\"\n\nThe superintendent of Wilson County Schools confirmed damage at Springfield Middle School, where sections of the walls and roof of the 6th and 7th grade halls are gone or compromised.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking to see the school right after the event,\" Superintendent Lane Mills said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Lucama, deputies in Bladenboro had posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree as well as roads that had been washed out. Standing water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny North Carolina town.\n\nMany of the townspeople helped fill sandbags on Wednesday before up to 3 feet (91 centimeters) of floodwaters backed into the downtown overnight. Working in the dark, the town administrator, commissioners and residents helped businesses save as much merchandise as possible, Police Chief Kevin Rouse said.\n\nWhen the sun came up, water could still be seen bubbling out of manhole covers in the town of about 1,600. Debby may not have been the worst storm to come through the region, but Rouse said he watches every storm wearily.\n\n\"Even though it wasn't a severe, major hurricane you still had a lot of water. You start getting 6, 12, 20 inches of rainfall, that's going to cripple you,\" Rouse said.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. He had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nThe neighbors on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Weather Service has confirmed that two tornadoes touched down in northeast Ohio when a series of severe thunderstorms roared through the region Tuesday afternoon. The storms caused extensive damage and knocked out power out to hundreds of thousands of residents for several hours. No injuries were reported in either tornado.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least seven people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees.

It's a lesson learned the hard way. Taylor estimates this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home. He said it is an annoyance, but one he is trying to get used to.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned that isolated areas could see up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain from Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nFor Georgia homeowners in suburban Pooler west of Savannah, the drenching came with a dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, rain from Hurricane Matthew overwhelmed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the inland neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding.\n\nBut residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite efforts by the local government to fix them.\n\nDebby also rained on residents all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another storm system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\nUp to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some New York City neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in New York City and surrounding areas.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio by Wednesday afternoon following severe storms there, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\n'Imminent failure' of dam\n\nMeanwhile, the \"imminent failure\" of a dam in southeast Georgia was threatening to swamp a mobile home park and other areas downstream, the National Weather Service said in a flash flood warning Wednesday afternoon. The Cypress Lake Dam is in Bulloch County, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Savannah.\n\n\"If the dam breaks, flash flooding will occur immediately downstream of the dam,\" the weather service said.\n\nIn South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster said the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bands develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nFlooding possible next week\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday afternoon, 55 miles (89 kilometers) east-southeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said. The tropical storm could make a second landfall in either North Carolina or South Carolina, expected late Wednesday or early Thursday. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of

Debby has resulted in six fatalities and multiple power outages, with ongoing risks of further rain and tornadoes. It will continue affecting the northeastern U.S.\n\nTropical Storm Debby made a second landfall northeast of Charleston early Thursday, unleashing more rain on coastal South and North Carolina, sparking fresh concerns of flash flooding in waterlogged regions. The storm struck land again at Bulls Bay, South Carolina, days after it hit Florida's Gulf Coast as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday, then traveled through northern Florida and Georgia to the Atlantic.\n\nAs of Thursday morning, Debby, responsible for at least six deaths, was around 90 miles north of Charleston and 65 miles southwest of Myrtle Beach. The National Hurricane Center warned of up to 3 inches of rain possibly falling on Thursday in eastern South Carolina, raising total rainfall since Monday to over 25 inches in some areas. Southeastern North Carolina could see up to 15 inches, and parts of Virginia up to 10 inches.\n\nDespite less rain on Wednesday, meteorologist Rich Bann from the National Weather Service warned that Debby's moisture would recede inland, posing more flooding risks. The storm's movement northwest at 7 mph and sustained winds of 45 mph suggested weakening to a tropical depression by Thursday afternoon or evening.\n\nOver 140,000 customers were powerless in the Carolinas Thursday morning, per tracking site Poweroutage.us, with another 7,000 still out in Florida.

A flood watch was in effect throughout the region.\n\nBoth North and South Carolina declared a state of emergency in anticipation of Debby. By Wednesday afternoon, South Carolina had already seen heavy rainfall and flooding in some areas of the state. Debby is expected to impact the Charlotte area in the early hours of Thursday morning through Friday. Federal Emergency Management Agency representative Michael Hart said its residents should use Wednesday to get read.\n\n\"Take necessary precautions right now. They should be ensuring, if it's still safe to do so, they have enough water, canned goods, batteries, blankets to sustain themselves for several days if necessary,\" he said.\n\nDebby is moving at a sluggish pace with heavy rainfall and maximum wind speeds up to 60 mph according to the National Weather Service. South Carolina has already begun to see rainfall totals of up to 17 inches in some parts of the state. In North Carolina, the southeastern part of the state is projected to see as much as 15 inches of rain and the risk of flooding continues through Friday.\n\nRowan-Salisbury Schools canceled classes Thursday, which was set to be their first day of school. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools are still on vacation, but said early and middle college programs that are meeting now will move to asynchronous virtual learning on Thursday, and extracurricular sports and club events are canceled.\n\nIn Southern Pines, expected to get more rain than Charlotte, officials are bracing for Debby.\n\nMike Cameron, assistant town manager and fire chief, says they have already had a few trees and tree limbs fall due to the rain over the last several days. Cameron says they have set up an emergency operations center that will be staffed if needed.\n\n\"If emergency call volume or citizen issues become unmanageable at our normal staffing levels, we will staff our emergency operations center. We're probably in that 9-to-11 inches of rain over multiple days but that is still a significant event,\" he said.\n\nCameron says they have sandbags available for residents and barricades ready to be set up if needed to close roads if flooding occurs. He says the heaviest rains are expected late Wednesday through Thursday.\n\nDuring a press conference Wednesday afternoon, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said even when the rain subsides, floodwater can still be dangerous.\n\n\"After the rains are gone and when the sun comes out, we could still have a lot of rain. A lot of puddles, a lot of things in, in yards and around the small towns,\" he said. \"Those waters are not necessarily clean because there's been a lot of stuff that's been going into them from chemicals on farmlands to overrunning sewer systems and all of that. So, be very careful.\"\n\nPresident Biden approved North Carolina's emergency declaration ahead of Tropical Storm Debby's arrival, paving the way for help from the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency if disaster relief efforts are necessary. Speaking alongside other state officials Wednesday, Gov. Roy Cooper said this storm can be as dangerous, or more, than a hurricane.\n\n\"A slow-moving tropical storm can sometimes be even more deadly than a quick-moving hurricane. That means even without the constant high winds, we must be on high alert,\" he said.\n\nFlooding is the greatest concern with this system, and Cooper implored drivers not to drive through water-covered roads; he said it only takes 6 inches of fast-moving floodwater to knock over an adult and just 12 inches to carry away most cars.", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE 90.7 - Charlotte's NPR News Source"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hart_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Hart (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_alert", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood alert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Emergency_Management_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Emergency Management Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Cameron", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Cameron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_operations_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency operations center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte-Mecklenburg_Schools", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Pines,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Pines, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southern Pines, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sandbag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roy Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewerage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sewerage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_McMaster", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henry McMaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/75f1acd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/897x471+0+133/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F99%2Fdf%2Fe4fd55c84fe399a298464767d0a0%2F174654-5day-cone-no-line-and-wind.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799531", "eventUri": "eng-9799531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It was still a tropical storm Thursday morning, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph.\n\nDebby wasn't done flooding parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina, and an additional 3 to 9 inches of rain are possible as the storm moves north, raising concerns of flash floods in mountainous areas of Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nDebby also could bring more tornadoes Thursday in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said. At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.\n\nOne person died in a home damaged by the tornado in Lucama, N.C., Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email. No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nTheresa Richardson hunkered down with her husband and granddaughter in the closet of their Lucama home as the tornado tore through about a mile away.\n\nDebris struck the house, and they could hear the roof of nearby Springfield Middle School being ripped off. The home of one of her granddaughter's friends was destroyed.\n\nRichardson said this wasn't the first time the area was struck by a tornado -- her neighbors call the road they live on \"Tornado Alley.\"\n\nThe superintendent of Wilson County Schools confirmed damage at Springfield Middle School, where sections of the walls and a were destroyed or compromised.\n\nMeanwhile, about 100 miles south of Lucama, deputies in Bladenboro had posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree as well as roads that had been washed out. Standing water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny North Carolina town.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, S.C., Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick,\" Taylor said. \"But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nThe neighbors on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAt least seven people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Fla., whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los

And the National Weather Service's office in Charleston said survey teams earlier confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nDebby makes landfall again and could cause problems into weekend\n\nTropical Storm Debby is heading up the East Coast as it has made landfall for a second time. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAs Debby drenches South Carolina, heavy rainfall from the tropical storm is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nAt least four dams breached by floodwaters in eastern Georgia county\n\nIn Bulloch County northwest of Savannah, Georgia, at least four dams have been breached by floodwaters, but so far no fatalities have been reported, authorities said at a Wednesday news briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county's director of emergency management. About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFrequent floods are part of life along the water\n\nGene Taylor was waiting for a few inches of water to drain back out of his home as high tide passed Wednesday afternoon at his home along French Quarter Creek, not far from the Cooper River in Huger and about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston.\n\nThis is the fourth time his home's been flooded in the past nine years, and he heeded the warnings this time, moving things up or out.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home -- a common annoyance now.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as Tropical Storm Debby's rainfall drains out to sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia have neared 18 feet, surpassing previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nSouth Carolina's drama is still playing out\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported from Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bans develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby pushed bad weather up the East Coast on Wednesday, colliding with other systems and bringing no respite to residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey, where heavy rain flooded highways and streets and stranded motorists. Officials in New York told people in basement apartments to prepare to flee.\n\nDebby has already drenched Southern states for days as it churned slowly across Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nBut on Tuesday evening, the moisture from Debby strengthened another storm system, which caused strong thunderstorms across the Great Lakes and in Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some New York City neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in New York City and surrounding areas.\n\nNearly 340,000 customers were without power in Ohio following storms there, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nStill, the most rain from Debby so far has fallen in the South.\n\nA spot near Lake City in north Florida leads the nation in total rainfall from Debby at a whopping 19.67 inches, according to national Weather Prediction Center.\n\nMeanwhile, the \"imminent failure\" of a dam in southeast Georgia was threatening to swamp a mobile home park and other areas downstream, the National Weather Service said in a flash flood warning Wednesday afternoon. The Cypress Lake Dam is in Bulloch County, about 50 miles northwest of Savannah.\n\n\"If the dam breaks, flash flooding will occur immediately downstream of the dam,\" the weather service said.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains that damaged more than 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into today when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4-8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bands develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nAnother area of concern Wednesday was southeastern North Carolina, where Hurricane Matthew caused a historic billion-dollar flood in 2016. Two years later, many of those records were broken during Hurricane Florence. Both storms killed dozens.\n\nThe National Weather Service said up to 9 inches of rain could fall west of Wilmington, North Carolina, in areas that already saw heavy rains overnight.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations for the storm without declaring a state of emergency.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday afternoon, 55 miles east-southeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said. The tropical storm could make a second landfall in either North Carolina or South Carolina, expected late Wednesday or early today.\n\nDebby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nSavannah Fire Advanced Firefighters Ron Strauss, right, and Andrew Stevenson, left, carry food to residents in the Tremont Park neighborhood that where stranded in flooding from Tropical Storm Debby, Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024, in Savannah, Ga.

By the weekend, the storm could also produce rain of up to 4 inches in central New York state and into northern Vermont.\n\nDebby was located about 20 miles (35 kms) northeast of Charleston and moving about 5 miles per hour (7 km per hour) toward the northwest, with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph). Additional weakening is forecast today as the storm's center moves farther inland, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAt least six people have died in Florida and Georgia in the wake of the storm, which made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and headed northeast.\n\nGovernors in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia have declared states of emergency. The storm has already left neighborhoods and communities underwater, washing out streets and inundating homes across the region.\n\nEmergency management officials were keeping a close watch as the rainwater drained into the numerous river systems that snake through the Carolinas.

At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said. No injuries were immediately reported.\n\nOne person died in a home damaged by the tornado in Lucama, North Carolina, Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email. No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nTheresa Richardson hunkered down with her husband and granddaughter in the closet of their Lucama home as the tornado tore through about a mile away.\n\nDebris struck the house. And they could hear the roof of nearby Springfield Middle School being ripped off. The home of one of her granddaughter's friends was destroyed from the tornado.\n\nRichardson said this wasn't the first time the area was struck by a tornado -- her neighbours call the road they live on \"Tornado Alley.\"\n\nThe superintendent of Wilson County Schools confirmed damage at Springfield Middle School, where sections of the walls and roof of the 6th and 7th grade halls are gone or compromised.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking to see the school right after the event,\" Superintendent Lane Mills said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, about 100 miles (161 kilometres) south of Lucama, deputies in Bladenboro had posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree as well as roads that had been washed out. Standing water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny North Carolina town.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. He had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nThe neighbours on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of deja vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometres) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighbourhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimetres) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighbourhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least seven people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank\n\n------", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news",

Additional weakening is forecast today as the storm's center moves farther inland, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAt least six people have died in Florida and Georgia in the wake of the storm, which made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and headed northeast.\n\nGovernors in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia have declared states of emergency. The storm has already left neighborhoods and communities underwater, washing out streets and inundating homes across the region.", "source": {"uri": "bna.bh", "dataType": "news", "title":

Stephen B. Morton/Associated Press\n\nLUCAMA, N.C. -- Tropical Storm Debby spawned damaging tornadoes that killed one person, flooded a town and temporarily shut down part of Interstate 95 early Thursday as it blew into North Carolina after making a second landfall overnight.\n\nThe storm was expected to churn up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of flooding rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It was still a tropical storm Thursday morning, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph.\n\nDebby wasn't done flooding parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina, and an additional 3 to 9 inches of rain is possible as the storm moves north, raising concerns of flash floods in mountainous areas of Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nDebby also could bring more tornadoes Thursday in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said. At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.\n\nOne person died in a home damaged by the tornado in Lucama, North Carolina, Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email. No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheresa Richardson hunkered down with her husband and granddaughter in the closet of their Lucama home as the tornado tore through about a mile away.\n\nDebris struck the house. And they could hear the roof of nearby Springfield Middle School being ripped off. The home of one of her granddaughter's friends was destroyed from the tornado.\n\nRichardson said this wasn't the first time the area was struck by a tornado - her neighbors call the road they live on \"Tornado Alley.\"\n\nCharles Grainger cleans up around his house in the historic district of French Quarter Creek as flood waters recede from Tropical Storm Debby on Wednesday in Huger, S.C. Mic Smith/Associated Press\n\nThe superintendent of Wilson County Schools confirmed damage at Springfield Middle School, where sections of the walls and roof of the 6th and 7th grade halls are gone or compromised.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking to see the school right after the event,\" Superintendent Lane Mills said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, about 100 miles south of Lucama, deputies in Bladenboro had posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree as well as roads that had been washed out. Standing water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny North Carolina town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany of the townspeople helped fill sandbags on Wednesday before up to 3 feet of floodwaters backed into the downtown overnight. Working in the dark, the town administrator, commissioners and residents helped businesses save as much merchandise as possible, Police Chief Kevin Rouse said.\n\nWhen the sun came up, water could still be seen bubbling out of manhole covers in the town of about 1,600. Debby may not have been the worst storm to come through the region, but Rouse said he watches every storm wearily.\n\n\"Even though it wasn't a severe, major hurricane you still had a lot of water. You start getting 6, 12, 20 inches of rainfall, that's going to cripple you,\" Rouse said.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. He had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nThe neighbors on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nGene Taylor clean up around his house in the historic district of French Quarter Creek as flood waters from Tropical Storm Debby recede Wednesday in Huger, S.C. Mic Smith/Associated Press\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Weather Service has confirmed that two tornadoes touched down in northeast Ohio when a series of severe thunderstorms roared through the region Tuesday afternoon. The storms caused extensive damage and knocked out power out to hundreds of thousands of residents for several hours. No injuries were reported in either tornado.\n\nAs much as 6 inches of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least seven people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the

On Monday, the storm came ashore along Florida's Big Bend region before moving across Georgia and meandering along the Atlantic coast.\n\nDebby is expected to drop 4 to 8 inches of rain - some areas could pick up to 15 inches - across parts of the Carolinas and Virginia on Thursday and Friday. One to 3 inches of rain per hour is possible, which could quickly add up to half a foot by Thursday morning, according to the weather service. Heavier totals were \"not out of the question,\" the weather service added.\n\n\"Numerous to widespread areas of flash flooding are expected to continue in association with Debby, with considerable to locally catastrophic impacts,\" the weather service's Storm Prediction Center said. \"This will include a significant urban flash flood threat from Greensboro to the Raleigh-Durham area, with areas near and to the north of Wilmington also at risk.\"\n\nDebby is forecast to weaken as it picks up speed and moves north, dumping up to half an inch of rain from Maryland through Upstate New York and Vermont. Flood watches were active throughout the Mid-Atlantic region.\n\nThe storm has drenched Florida, Georgia and South Carolina in over a foot of rain, breaking several decades-old records. Some areas of South Carolina are expected to reach over 2 feet of rain by the weekend. Across the region, flash flooding triggered water rescues, overtook roads and breached several dams as winds knocked over trees and tangled power lines. Officials have said at least six people have died as a result of the storm.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n\u220e Millions of people from southeast Georgia up though the Carolinas and western New York were under flood advisories, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of North Carolina and Virginia, including the cities of Wakefield and Virginia Beach, were under tornado watches.\n\n\u220e In Florida, cleanup crews have cleared over 245 miles of road and eight acres of debris across the state, according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management. Emergency responders in high-water vehicles and on foot rescued at least 120 people trapped by floodwaters.\n\nDebby tracker map: See tropical storm's path as it's projected to push northeast\n\nTropical Storm Debby spins up suspected tornadoes; school damaged\n\nTropical Storm Debby spun multiple possible tornadoes across North Carolina overnight as it made its second U.S. landfall.\n\nOne confirmed tornado touched down in North Carolina's Sampson County, damaging two homes, according to weather service reports. Two suspected tornadoes were reported in Pender and Wilson counties, and one caused \"extensive damage\" to a middle school outside Greensboro, the weather service said.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Weather Service office in Charleston, South Carolina, confirmed four tornado touchdowns: In Moncks Corner, Edisto Beach, Kiawah Island and Lady's Island. Several structures were damaged as trees uprooted and utility poles were toppled.\n\nOver 150,000 in the dark; Duke Energy scrambles to fix outages in NC\n\nFrom South Carolina to Virginia, nearly 150,000 homes and businesses were without power early Thursday, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe majority of outages - over 137,000 - were reported in North Carolina, which has been pummeled by Debby's most intense conditions since the tropical storm made landfall around 2 a.m. The largest utility provider in the state, Duke Energy, reported 101,817 outages. On Wednesday, Duke Energy said it had 7,500 lineworkers and other employees staged across the Carolinas to respond to outages.\n\nMeanwhile, nearby South Carolina reported over 8,500 outages and Virginia had 4,300, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nNearly 7,000 utility customers across northern Florida's Big Bend region, where Debby made its first U.S. landfall on Monday, were still in the dark four days later. Since Wednesday, North Florida and other parts of the South were baked by a heat wave that raised temperatures into the high 90s and heat index levels into the triple digits.\n\nWhere is Tropical Storm Debby?\n\nTropical Storm Debby was located 50 miles north-northeast of Charleston and 60 miles southwest of Myrtle Beach, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nMoving northwest at 5 mph, Debby has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, the hurricane center said. Debby is forecast to weaken over the next day or so, becoming a tropical depression by as early as Thursday afternoon before merging with a front on Friday and being downgraded to a extratropical cyclone.\n\nOn Friday, Debby is expected to move across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions before emerging over Canada on Saturday, according to the hurricane center.", "source": {"uri":

About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFrequent floods are part of life along the water\n\nGene Taylor was waiting for a few inches of water to drain back out of his home as high tide passed Wednesday afternoon at his home along French Quarter Creek, not far from the Cooper River in Huger and about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston.\n\nThis is the fourth time his home's been flooded in the past nine years, and he heeded the warnings this time, moving things up or out.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home -- a common annoyance now.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as Tropical Storm Debby's rainfall drains out to sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia have neared 18 feet, surpassing previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nSouth Carolina's drama is still playing out\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported from Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bans develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Tuesday and Wednesday will be slightly breezy, but \"aren't expected to be a big problem.\"\n\nHeavier rainfall should come later on Thursday and Friday, Kimball said. Charlotte is expected to see 2 to 4 inches throughout the week, while areas east of Charlotte could see closer to 6 to 8 inches.\n\nThe News & Observer also reported that the southeastern region, including Wilmington, Jacksonville and Lumberton, could see 16 inches.

But if Debby's path shifted from traveling northeast, and drifted westward in South Carolina toward the Upstate, then Charlotte could potentially see heavier rainfall.\n\n\"But right now, most of the guidance that I'm looking at doesn't do that,\" Kimball siad. \"That's still a possibility, but it's not expected to happen.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kimball", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Kimball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Douglas_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Douglas International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_News_&_Observer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The News & Observer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upstate South Carolina"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumberton,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lumberton, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lumberton, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Durham, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Durham, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Hill,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/charlotte_observer_mcclatchy_513/7a521f22e584d242443c0983d34024d8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799531", "eventUri": "eng-9799531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

(WBTV) - The amount and location of rainfall across the Carolinas amid Tropical Storm Debby this week slightly shifted as of Thursday morning.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center on Thursday, Aug. 8 released updated projections of rain totals and Tropical Storm Debby's trajectory for the next few days. The storm was churning over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday and made a second landfall in the Carolinas early Thursday morning.\n\nRain totals near 30 inches were initially possible in South Carolina near Charleston, according to the National Hurricane Center. Those totals have shifted somewhat as of Thursday, including for other areas.\n\nHere's what to expect from Tropical Storm Debby, as of data provided Thursday.\n\nSoutheast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina were projected to see the most rain on Thursday and Friday -- though central Virginia could also see significant rainfall.\n\nParts of northeast South Carolina could see more than 20 inches of rain by Saturday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 6 inches of rainfall with locally higher amounts, across portions of southeastern North Carolina leading to maximum storm total amounts as high as 15 inches. Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches over portions of eastern South Carolina will bring maximum storm total amounts as high as 20 to 25 inches,\" the National Hurricane Center writes.\n\nSoutheast North Carolina near the South Carolina border could receive anywhere from 6-15 inches of rain as the storm moves through, according to a graphic published by the hurricane center. Areas near the Charlotte Metro -- like Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, Union, and York counties -- could see 4-6 inches of rain in the coming days.\n\nCommunities along the southeast North Carolina coast could receive anywhere from 4-12 inches of rain by Saturday night. Much of the southeastern portion of the state is projected to see around 6-8 inches.\n\nRainfall estimates shared in the hurricane center's graphic -- shown below -- may be lower than actual local rainfall totals, officials said.\n\nThe western parts of the Carolinas should see much less rain this week.\n\n---> School closures: Charlotte Metro districts cancel 1st day of class amid Tropical Storm Debby\n\nFlood warnings have been issued for two Charlotte-area counties in South Carolina as Tropical Storm Debby prepares to make a second landfall this week.\n\nFlood warnings were issued for Chesterfield and Lancaster counties in South Carolina starting Thursday, Aug. 8 and Friday, Aug. 9, respectively, due to potentially historic rain totals that could cause flooding.\n\nSee the full flood warning alerts here.\n\nChesterfield and Lancaster counties in South Carolina were specifically at risk of flooding due to excessive rainfall. Flooding of streets, rivers, creeks, streams, and other \"low-lying and flood-prone locations\" will be possible, the National Weather Service reports.\n\nFlash flooding is a particular concern in the Carolinas this week. Flash flooding happens at a quicker rate, and typically dissipates faster than regular flooding events, experts say.\n\nAccording to Kim Stenson, director of the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, the anticipated rainfall could set new records for the state. The many inches of rain could lead to flooding and flash flooding in the state.\n\n\"The heavy rains and flooding currently predicted this week are historic in scope and scale. Our experts with the National Hurricane Center believe flooding to be catastrophic for many parts of South Carolina,\" Stenson said in a statement Monday. \"Take no chances with this storm.\"\n\nFlood watches were also active for several counties in North Carolina and South Carolina near the Charlotte Metro area due to the storm. Flood watches are issued when flooding is possible, while flood warnings are issued when flooding is happening or about to happen.\n\nWeather alerts and warnings were likely active for many other counties in the Carolinas outside of our region.\n\nWhile flooding is a risk across the entire region, storm surge flooding is a particular concern along the coast of the Carolinas.\n\nBoth North and South Carolina are at risk of seeing 1-3 feet of storm surge above ground, according to details posted Wednesday.\n\nWhat is storm surge?\n\nStorm surge is an unusually high water level caused by a storm. Storm surge can cause ocean waters to move much further inland than normal, depending on the severity of the storm.\n\nStorm surge happens because the \"wind circulation around the eye of a hurricane causes a vertical circulation in the ocean,\" according to the National Hurricane Center. When the storm reaches shallow water near the coast, the water can't move downward due to the vertical circulation, which forces the water to move upward and inland, officials said.\n\nStorm surge can travel up rivers and canals , bringing the water well inland, the NHC says. The leading cause of fatalities during hurricanes is storm surge.\n\nA State of Emergency was declared for South Carolina before the storm touched down as a hurricane on Monday. A State of Emergency was also active in North Carolina, as of Monday.\n\nPeople in Debby's path are urged to take the following steps, as shared by the North Carolina governor's office Monday:",

However, with the storm slowing down even more, Debby will stay stuck over the Southeast for the better part of this week, meandering over Georgia and the Carolinas.\n\nEven though the storm is expected to weaken a bit more overnight, Debby is still expected to bring historic rainfall and life-threatening flooding to portions of southeastern Georgia and the coastal areas of the Carolinas over the next few days. Rainfall totals from this event are expected to reach between 10 and 20 inches.\n\nAlready, portions of southeastern Georgia and South Carolina have seen between 3 to 6 inches of rainfall, but with rainfall rates of 1.5 to 3 inches per hour possible, flood alerts remain in effect.\n\nA Flash Flood Warning was issued for Charleston, South Carolina, where rainfall rates between 1.5 and 2.5 inches are expected. Ongoing or new flooding is expected, with an additional 2 to 4 inches of rain possible over the next few hours.\n\nAs onshore flow continues, storm surge remains an issue in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. Storm surge alerts remain in effect up the Georgia and Carolina coastlines.\n\nRainfall aside, Debby could also generate some spin-up tornadoes as it swirls over the Georgia-South Carolina border tonight. As a result, a Tornado Watch also remains in effect for parts of southeastern Georgia and South Carolina until 1 a.m. ET.\n\nOver the next 48 hours, Debby is expected to meander back over the Atlantic but will continue to hug the coastline before heading back inland over the Carolinas again. Slight strengthening can't entirely be ruled out as it moves back over water, but ultimately, Debby is expected to weaken once it moves back inland. Strength aside, it will still bring significant rainfall to portions of the Southeast, which will likely lead to catastrophic flooding in some areas.\n\nDebby is expected to eventually drift toward the north/northeast by the end of the week into the weekend. As it heads north, it will likely weaken to a tropical depression or remnant low. Regardless, heavy rainfall is still expected up the I-95 corridor heading into this weekend.\n\nPower returns to some Florida customers as Debby moves northeast\n\nAs of Monday evening, 146,034 customers are without power in Florida, according to the latest update from a U.S. power outage map.\n\nThis marks an improvement from Monday morning, which saw nearly 300,000 customers without power at 9:50 a.m. ET, the height of outages across the state.\n\nDuring a press conference in Tallahassee Monday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state's emergency department had 17,000 linemen working to restore power in the wake of the storm.\n\n\"We have a lot of restoration personnel ready to go,\" DeSantis said.\n\nDebby weakening, but threats of tornadoes, heavy rain continue\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to weaken, with maximum sustained winds down to 45 mph as of 8 p.m. ET. The weather pattern is moving very slowly to the northeast at 6 mph, and the center is currently about 50 miles east of Valdosta, Georgia.\n\nEven though Debby is now inland and continues to weaken, many of the impacts -- especially the heavy rainfall and dangerous flash flood threat -- will not abate for several days. For many locations in coastal Georgia and South Carolina, the worst is yet to come.\n\nThe tornado threat continues along portions of the Georgia and South Carolina coasts this evening and into tonight. A Tornado Watch remains in effect from Savannah, Georgia, to Charleston, South Carolina, until at least 1 a.m. ET.\n\nParts of Florida, including Sarasota and Lakewood Ranch, are reporting over a foot of rain from Debby, and portions of Suwannee County, including Live Oak, are getting around a foot as well.\n\nSo far, parts of Georgia, including Savannah, are reporting nearly 4'' of rain. The same can be said for Hilton Head, South Carolina.\n\nConditions will continue to deteriorate across much of South Carolina overnight Monday into Tuesday, with widespread areas of heavy rain and the potential for dangerous, significant flash flooding during nighttime hours.\n\nCoastal flooding and storm surges will continue to increase in the coming hours as winds increase and more persistent heavy rain moves in, heading into high tide along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts.\n\nBy late Tuesday afternoon or early evening, the center of Debby will likely be moving off the Southeast coast and into the Atlantic, where it will meander for about 24 hours before likely turning back toward the coast and potentially making another landfall as a tropical storm somewhere along the South Carolina coast by Thursday morning or afternoon.\n\nMore than 163,000 customers without power in Florida\n\nMore than 163,000 customers are without power in Florida, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks energy outages.\n\nCurfew set for Charleston, South Carolina\n\nA curfew will go into effect overnight for Charleston, South Carolina, due to Debby, city officials said Monday.\n\nThoroughfares leading into the peninsula will be closed from 11 p.m. ET Monday to noon ET Tuesday, the city said, as the region braces for potential impacts such as tropical storm-force winds, heavy rain and isolated tornadoes.\n\n\"We urge everybody to stay inside, stay indoors and do not travel,\" Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a press briefing Monday evening.\n\nBiden approves emergency declaration request from South Carolina\n\nPresident Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration in the state due to Debby, the White House said.\n\nThe declaration allows the Federal Emergency Management Agency to mobilize and provide equipment and resources necessary.\n\n\"The President continues to urge residents to remain vigilant and heed the warnings of State and local officials,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nNorth Carolina governor declares state of emergency\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency ahead of severe weather, including life-threatening flash flooding, expected across the state due to Debby.\n\n\"This weather has the potential to bring intense rain and flooding to North Carolina and we are preparing for it,\" Cooper said in a statement. \"As the weather becomes more severe, I urge everyone to take precautions and stay safe.\"\n\nThe emergency declaration will allow for the state to mobilize resources to respond to the storm.\n\nTropical Storm Debby slowing down as it moves across US\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to weaken and slow down in forward speed as the center moves near the Florida-Georgia state line as of 5 p.m. ET.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are down to 50 mph, and Debby is moving to the northeast at 6 mph. The center is currently about 30 miles southeast of Valdosta, Georgia.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, all tropical weather and storm surge alerts have been canceled across Florida's Gulf Coast as conditions improve across much of the state.\n\nDebby will move across southeastern Georgia through Monday evening, with the worst impacts focused there and into the Jacksonville, Florida, area. Heavy rain continues to overspread southern South Carolina as well.\n\nMore than 199,000 customers are without power in Florida, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks energy outages.\n\nLatest forecast\n\nDebby is moving inland across north Florida Monday afternoon after dumping more than 1 foot of rain in the state.\n\nTornadoes are possible Monday afternoon in Florida, including in Tampa, Orlando and Jacksonville, as well as in the coastal cities of Savannah, Georgia, and Beaufort, South Carolina.\n\nThe biggest concern this week is flash flooding from the widespread, relentless rain. A flash flood emergency remains in effect in Suwannee County, Florida, northwest of Gainesville, where 10 to 15 inches of rain has fallen so far.\n\nDebby will slowly churn into southeastern Georgia throughout Monday afternoon and evening. Conditions will deteriorate in Savannah, Georgia, throughout the day.\n\nAt least four people have been killed from Debby, authorities said.\n\n13-year-old boy was killed when a tree fell on a mobile home Monday morning in Levy County, Florida, which encompasses Cedar Key, according to the Levy County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with this family as they deal with this tragedy,\" the sheriff's office said in a statement. \"We encourage everyone to use extreme caution as they begin to assess and clean up the damage. Downed powerlines and falling trees are among the many hazards.\"\n\nIn Hillsborough County, Florida, which encompasses Tampa, a driver of a semi was killed when the truck went into a canal off Interstate 275 Monday morning, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office.\n\nDeputies recovered the semi and found the driver dead inside the cab, authorities said.\n\n\"It's just heartbreaking,\" Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told ABC News Live. \"We really ask everyone, one, to be aware of the weather situations in your area, and then heed the warnings. Especially the high wind and the water.\"\n\nIn Dixie County, Florida, a driver \"lost control due to the inclement weather and wet roadway\" on Sunday night, crashing into the center median guardrail and then overturning the car, the Florida Highway Patrol said.\n\nThe driver, a 38-year-old woman, and a passenger, a 12-year-old boy, were killed, authorities said.\n\nAnother passenger, a 14-year-old boy, was seriously injured, the highway patrol said.\n\nFlash flood emergency issued in Suwannee County, Florida\n\nA flash flood emergency has been issued in Suwannee County in north Florida, northwest of Gainesville, where officials are reporting that water is entering structures.\n\nTen to 15 inches of rain has inundated the county so far and another 3 to 6 inches of rain is expected.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights have been canceled within, into or out of the U.S. on Monday, and that number is expected to continue to climb.\n\nAmerican Airlines is seeing the biggest impacts because of its hubs in Miami and Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nAmerican Airlines said it canceled operations at airports in Gainesville, Sarasota and Tallahassee until noon on Monday.\n\nSunday was one of the worst air travel days of the year with more than 2,400 cancellations.\n\nBiden briefed on storm\n\nPresident Joe Biden was briefed Monday morning on the administration's ongoing response to Debby, according to a White House official.\n\nOn Saturday, Biden approved Florida's request for an emergency declaration and deployed rescue personnel, meals and water, the official said.\n\nThe Biden administration is in touch with officials from Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.

Ron DeSantis warned Monday.\n\nSignificant flooding has already impacted the Bradenton and Sarasota County area up to North Florida, he said.\n\nMore than 250,000 customers without power in Florida\n\nMore than 250,000 customers are without power in Florida Monday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks energy outages.\n\nDebby makes landfall in Florida\n\nHurricane Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, on Monday morning, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers without power in Florida, tracker says\n\nMore than 135,000 customers were without power in Florida early Monday, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks energy outages.\n\nDebby approaches landfall with 80 mph winds\n\nHurricane Debby is \"very near\" landfall along Florida's Gulf Coast, the National Hurricane Center said at 5 a.m. ET.\n\n\"Expected to bring life-threatening storm surge in portions of Florida and major flooding in the southeastern United States,\" the center said in an update.\n\nThe Category 1 storm had maximum sustained winds of an about 80 mph as it approached Big Bend, a northern area near the Panhandle, the center said.\n\nDebby strengthens, with maximum sustained winds up to 80 mph\n\nHurricane Debby continued to strengthen, with maximum sustained winds rising to 80 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nMore than 10 inches of rain fell on the west coast of Florida, around the Tampa Bay area, where water rescues have been on going near Clearwater. Significant flooding also has been reported in Fort Myers area.\n\nStorm surge has been rising quickly now along the Big Bend area in Florida, from Cedar Key to Keaton Beach, where up to 10 feet of Gulf water could inundate the coastline. The storm is forecast to make landfall in that area on Monday morning.\n\nCoast Guard rescues two adrift in sailboat off Florida coast\n\nTwo people were rescued Sunday from a boat that was adrift in about 20-foot seas off the coast of Boca Grande, Florida, the U.S. Coast Guard said.\n\nThe boaters were airlifted from their 34-foot sailboat after the vessel lost its sail about 73 miles off shore, the guard said.\n\nThe sailboat had been on course for Tarpon Springs from Key West, officials said. A friend of the boaters contacted the Coast Guard at about 5 p.m. Saturday, telling officials they had missed their check-in.\n\n\"We received an updated satellite position from the boaters' friend, which led to them being successfully located,\" Lt. Cmdr. Christopher Hooper, a search and rescue mission coordinator, said in a statement.\n\nThe boaters were rescued by a crew on an Air Station Clearwater MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter at about 11 a.m. on Sunday, the Coast Guard said. They had been adrift in seas that were between 15 and 20 feet, with wind speeds at about 50 knots. Visibility was low.\n\nThe names of the people on the boat were not released.\n\nDebby strengthens into a hurricane\n\nThe National Hurricane Center has upgraded Tropical Storm Debby to a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 75 mph.\n\nThe forecast is still on track for more strengthening overnight as Debby feeds off the warm water in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Water temperatures running 3 to 5 degrees above average are providing plenty of fuel for this storm to intensify before landfall, which will happen around 7 a.m. ET along the Big Bend region of Florida.\n\nTropical Storm Debby nearing hurricane strength at 70 mph\n\nWhile still a tropical storm, Debby is nearing hurricane strength, producing maximum sustained wind speeds up to 70 mph.\n\nDebby will continue to intensify rapidly overnight as it travels northward over the Gulf's warm waters. It is forecast to become a hurricane tonight. It is expected to strengthen to at least a strong Category 1 hurricane before making landfall along Florida's Big Bend region Monday morning (around 7 a.m. ET), producing sustained wind speeds near 85 mph and wind gusts reaching over 100 mph possible.\n\nLocated about 90 miles southwest of Cedar Key, Florida, the storm continues to impact the Florida Gulf Coast with heavy rainfall, storm surge, powerful winds and even spin-up tornadoes.\n\nA reported wind gust of 56 mph was reported in St. Petersburg, with two tornadoes reported in central Florida.\n\nA 60-mph wind gust was also reported near Sarasota, Florida.\n\nNumerous reports of flooding from heavy rainfall and surges have also been submitted up Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nThe Tornado Watch covering much of northern and central Florida and southern Georgia has been extended until 6 a.m. ET on Monday.\n\nOnce Debby moves over land, it will weaken. However, the lack of a steering current will cause the storm to slow down considerably. While its exact track remains questionable, model guidance suggests the storm will drift over the Atlantic or Southeast coastline late Monday night into Tuesday before meandering back over Georgia and the Carolinas. Interaction with the Atlantic could reenergize Debby, but that will greatly depend on the storm's path.\n\nEven though Debby's track and timing remain uncertain later this week, there is high confidence that it will bring historic rainfall and significant flooding across portions of the Southeast.\n\nRainfall ranging between 6 to 12 inches is possible from Florida's Big Bend region through southeastern Georgia and into the Carolinas. Parts of coastal Georgia and South Carolina will be in the bullseye for the heaviest rainfall. There, widespread totals between 10 to 20 inches are possible, with some places even seeing up to 30 inches locally. Because of this, significant urban and river flooding is anticipated.\n\nRainfall aside, hurricane and tropical storm force winds will continue to whip across Florida and will likely intensify Sunday night into Monday as the storm moves closer to the coast -- with areas just south and east of the storm's eyewall seeing the strongest gusts early Monday morning.\n\nStorm surge will also worsen along Florida's northern and central Gulf coast tonight into Monday morning, with the highest surge expected between Suwannee River and Ochlockonee River (6 to 10 feet).\n\nAll tropical alerts remain unchanged from the last update.\n\nTropical Storm Debby on track to become a hurricane overnight\n\nAs of 5 p.m. ET on Sunday, Tropical Storm Debby still has winds of 65 mph and is forecast to undergo rapid intensification into a hurricane overnight, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDebby is expected to make landfall as a hurricane in Florida's Big Bend region on Monday morning around 7 a.m.\n\nRain is expected to be the most impactful element from this storm, affecting a wide area over an extended period of time.\n\n\"Across portions of southeast Georgia and South Carolina, 10 to 20 inches of rainfall, with local amounts to 30 inches, are expected through Friday morning,\" the National Hurricane Center said. \"This potentially historic rainfall will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding.\"\n\nEvacuations ordered in Alachua County, Florida, as Debby set to make landfall\n\nAn evacuation order was issued Sunday for residents of Alachua County, Florida, residing in mobile homes, manufactured homes and recreational vehicles ahead of the arrival of Debby, which is forecast to be a hurricane when it makes landfall on Monday.\n\nPeople living in areas close to rivers and lakes, and low-lying areas that tend to flood in Alachua County are also encouraged to evacuate, according to a statement issued by county officials.\n\nGainesville is the largest city in Alachua County.\n\n\"We encourage residents affected to find alternative housing with friends, family or short-term rentals,\" according to the county's statement.\n\nAlachua County is opening three shelters for residents in need.\n\nTornado watch issued as Debby runs parallel to Florida's Gulf Coast\n\nA tornado watch was issued Sunday afternoon by the National Weather Service as Tropical Storm Debbie moved northward in the Gulf of Mexico parallel to Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nAt 2 p.m. Sunday, the National Hurricane Center said Debby was still a tropical storm with winds of 65 mph and forecasted to bring severe weather, including heavy rain, to coastal communities Sunday afternoon.\n\nA tornado watch is in effect for much of Florida through Sunday evening.\n\nDebby is expected to become a hurricane Sunday evening and will likely make landfall sometime between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. Monday in the Big Bend area of Florida's Panhandle.\n\nOnce Debby makes landfall, the storm is expected to slow down and essentially stall over the Southeast, dropping potentially historic amounts of rainfall as it moves into Georgia and South Carolina.\n\nA hurricane warning is in effect for the west coast of Florida from the Ochlockonee River southwest of Tallahassee to the Suwannee River northwest of Gainesville.\n\nMore than 1,600 flights canceled due to Debby and Northeast thunderstorms\n\nTropical Storm Debby and thunderstorms in the Northeast were causing airlines to cancel or delay flights on Sunday.\n\nAmerican Airlines said it canceled 601 flights, or about 16% of its flights, on Sunday, the most of any airline.\n\nDebby, now a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico, is expected to make landfall around the Big Bend area of the Florida Panhandle on Monday morning as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\nAlso causing delays and cancellations were severe thunderstorms moving up the East Coast. Parts of the mid-Atlantic states are under a severe thunderstorm watch until 9 p.m. ET Sunday, including the cities of Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City.\n\nThe most flights canceled on Sunday were at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, where 214 flights were canceled and another 172 were delayed, according to FlightAware.\n\nIn New York City, LaGuardia and John F. Kennedy international airports reported a combined 363 flights canceled and 258 delayed on Sunday.\n\nMiami International Airport reported 209 canceled flights and 151 delayed fights. Airports in Orlando, Tampa, Philadelphia, Newark, Washington, D.C., and Dallas-Fort Worth all reported more than 100 flight cancellations on Sunday.\n\nTen million people under tropical storm alert on Florida's Gulf Coast\n\nAbout 10 million people along Florida's west coast and up through Georgia and South and North Carolina were under a tropical storm alert Sunday as Debby took aim at the area and is forecast to make landfall in the Panhandle region on Monday.\n\nDebby, now a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico about 190 miles southwest of Tampa, is expected to make landfall sometime between 7 and 8 a.m. in Big Bend on the Florida Panhandle as a Category 1 hurricane, state emergency officials said.\n\nDebby is expected to create a storm surge of 4 to 7 feet in Cedar Key and Crystal River on the Florida west coast and a 2- to 5-foot storm surge farther south in Tampa and Sarasota.\n\nThe storm is forecast to move into the cities of Tallahassee and Jacksonville, bringing up to 20 inches of rain to some parts, before causing potential flooding in Georgia and the Carolinas on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nNational Guard put on alert for search and rescue: DeSantis\n\nMembers of the Florida National Guard have been advised to be prepared to conduct search-and-rescue missions once Tropical Storm Debby makes landfall on Monday, according to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nWidespread flooding is expected for the Florida Panhandle region, particularly in the Big Bend area where Debby is expected to make landfall Monday morning as a category 1 hurricane, DeSantis said during a news conference Sunday morning.\n\nDeSantis said the Florida National Guard and the state's Emergency Response Team are prepared to conduct search-and-rescue and provide humanitarian assistance.\n\n\"The Florida National Guard is standing by with 3,000 service members ready to assist the state Emergency Response Team, which includes search-and-rescue, route clearance, commodity distribution and protection of critical infrastructure,\" DeSantis said.\n\nThe governor said at least 12 swift boat crews and flat-bottom jon boat crews are also standing by to help with rescues.\n\nHe said that more than 30,000 bottles of water, more than 160,000 meals and nearly 14,000 tarps have been pre-staged in parts of Florida that are expected to be hit hard by the storm.\n\nDeSantis said Florida utility companies have notified up to 17,000 linemen to be ready to spring into action once it is safe to repair any damage.\n\nFlooding forecast as Debby expected to bring up to 20 inches of rain\n\nFlorida residents in the Big Bend region of the Panhandle were warned Sunday that Debby is going to bring \"catastrophic rain to the area\" that will cause flooding and power outages.\n\nKevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, said during a news conference on Sunday that once the Debby makes landfall as a possible Category 1 hurricane on Monday morning, winds will subside quickly, but the slow-moving storm will produce an abundance of rain.\n\n\"We're going to be in a catastrophic rain situation where we have situations in Florida that will receive 15, maybe as high as 20 inches of rain,\" Guthrie said.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis told residents who are in the path of the storm to expect widespread power outages.\n\n\"It's possible that you could have serious intensification between now and landfall. It could get up to 85, 90 and 95 mph sustained winds. That is absolutely possible, particularly in parts of the state like here in Tallahassee. There's going to be a lot of trees that are going to fall down and you're going to have debris. You are going to have power interruptions,\" the governor said.\n\nGov. DeSantis advises residents to make final preparations for Debby\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis advised residents of the state's Panhandle region on Sunday that they should be finalizing preparations for when Tropical Storm Debby makes its anticipated landfall Monday morning as a Category 1 hurricane.\n\n\"Now this is a storm that is potentially dangerous. Residents should be finalizing all of their preparations now,\" DeSantis said during a news conference at the state's Emergency Operation Center in Tallahassee.\n\nDeSantis said Tropical Storm Debby was in the Gulf of Mexico about 190 miles southwest of Tampa as of Sunday morning with sustained winds of about 50 mph.\n\n\"But those are expected to increase,\" DeSantis said. \"Tropical Storm Debby is likely to become a Category 1 hurricane before making landfall in the Big Bend region of Florida.\"\n\nHe said the storm was on a similar track taken by Hurricane Idalia in 2023. Idalia made landfall in Big Bend on Aug. 30, 2023, as a Category 3 hurricane and caused a devastating storm surge of 7 to 12 feet across the coastal Big Bend region in Levy, Dixie and Taylor counties.\n\n\"This storm is a similar track,\" DeSantis said. \"It may be a tick to the west of that. It very well may have greater impacts here in the Tallahassee region than Hurricane Idalia did. Once it crosses landfall and enters the Florida Panhandle/Big Bend Region, wherever it does, it's going to move very slowly across northern Florida and southeast Georgia.\"", "source": {"uri":

(WBTV) - Tropical Storm Debby was expected to make a second landfall in South Carolina late Wednesday or early Thursday.\n\nBoth North and South Carolina, but especially South Carolina, were forecast to receive potentially historic amounts of rain on Thursday, Aug. 8 through Friday, Aug. 9. The heaviest rain and storm hazards were expected to begin Thursday for the Carolinas, though stormy conditions were already present along the coast on Wednesday.\n\nHave a picture or video of the storm or the damage it's caused? We want you to share them with us! Upload a picture to our QCit platform below, and we may even feature them online or on air.\n\nTropical Storm Debby made a second landfall early Thursday morning in the Carolinas after churning over the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday. Southeast North Carolina and northeast South Carolina were projected to see the most rain on Thursday and Friday -- though central Virginia could also see significant rainfall.\n\nParts of northeast South Carolina could see more than 20 inches of rain by Saturday, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\n\"Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 6 inches of rainfall with locally higher amounts, across portions of southeastern North Carolina leading to maximum storm total amounts as high as 15 inches. Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches over portions of eastern South Carolina will bring maximum storm total amounts as high as 20 to 25 inches,\" the National Hurricane Center writes.\n\nSoutheast North Carolina near the South Carolina border could receive anywhere from 6-15 inches of rain as the storm moves through, according to a graphic published by the hurricane center. Areas near the Charlotte Metro -- like Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, Union, and York counties -- could see 4-6 inches of rain in the coming days.\n\nCommunities along the southeast North Carolina coast could receive anywhere from 4-12 inches of rain by Saturday night. Much of the southeastern portion of the state is projected to see around 6-8 inches.\n\nFlood warnings have been issued for two Charlotte-area counties in North Carolina and two in South Carolina as Tropical Storm Debby moves through the region Thursday.\n\nFlood warnings were issued for Anson and Stanly counties in North Carolina starting Thursday afternoon, and lasting until early Saturday morning. There, the Rocky River was at risk of flooding.\n\nFlood warnings were issued for Chesterfield and Lancaster counties in South Carolina starting Thursday and Friday, respectively, due to potentially historic rain totals that could cause flooding.\n\nSee the full flood warning alerts here.\n\nChesterfield and Lancaster counties in South Carolina were specifically at risk of flooding due to excessive rainfall. Flooding of streets, rivers, creeks, streams, and other \"low-lying and flood-prone locations\" will be possible, the National Weather Service reports.\n\nFlash flooding is a particular concern in the Carolinas this week. Flash flooding happens at a quicker rate, and typically dissipates faster than regular flooding events, experts say.\n\nAccording to Kim Stenson, director of the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, the anticipated rainfall could set new records for the state. The many inches of rain could lead to flooding and flash flooding in the state.\n\n\"The heavy rains and flooding currently predicted this week are historic in scope and scale. Our experts with the National Hurricane Center believe flooding to be catastrophic for many parts of South Carolina,\" Stenson said in a statement Monday. \"Take no chances with this storm.\"\n\nWeather alerts and warnings were likely active for many other counties in the Carolinas outside of our region.\n\nFlood watches were also active for several counties in North Carolina and South Carolina near the Charlotte Metro area due to the storm. Flood watches are issued when flooding is possible, while flood warnings are issued when flooding is happening or about to happen.\n\nPeople in the storm's path are urged to take the following steps,

That would bring rain totals to 25 inches (64 cm) in South Carolina and 15 inches (38 cm) in southeastern North Carolina near Wilmington and coastal Georgia.\n\nDebby was about 25 miles (40 kms) east-northeast of Charleston late Wednesday and moving about 3 miles per hour (5 km per hour) toward the north-northwest, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (97 kph). It was forecast to make landfall again further north in South Carolina early Thursday, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nDebby's greatest threat remains the sheer volume of rain it is dumping on the Eastern Seaboard and the potential for flooding that could continue into next week. In South Carolina, 15 homes had suffered major damage and one had been destroyed as a result of Debby's flooding.\n\nParts of Virginia were expected to get 3 to 7 inches (7.6 to 17.8 cm) of rain through Friday, while 2 to 4 inches (5.1 cm to 10.2 cm) were forecast for parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania and upstate New York through Saturday, with risks of flash floods, the center said.\n\n\"This is certainly an extreme rainfall event,\" said Neil Dixon, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Charleston, noting that daily rainfall records have already been broken in the area. \"In that respect, the flooding has been something that we haven't seen in many years.\"\n\nEmergency management officials were keeping a close watch as the rainwater drained into the numerous river systems that snake through the Carolinas. The National Water Prediction Service forecast that seven waterways would reach major flood levels before the weather event runs its course. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com",

(WCSC/AP) - Tropical Storm Debby is slowly reapproaching the South Carolina coast last Wednesday night as a major flood threat continues.\n\nClick here to download the free Live 5 First Alert Weather app.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Beaufort reported 12.74 inches of rain, and an area of Hilton Head Island reported 9.61 inches. Hanahan reported 10.17 inches of rain, and Charleston has seen 10.34 inches.\n\nGreen Pond has reported 14.02 inches of rain since Monday morning. Edisto Beach has seen 12.42 inches as of Tuesday morning. More than 11 inches of rain has fallen in Charleston and Summerville recorded more than 9 inches of rain.\n\nLive 5 Chief Meteorologist Bill Walsh says areas can expect another 4-8 inches of rain through Friday.\n\nPortions of the Lowcountry could see up to 20 inches of rain this week from Tropical Storm Debby and localized rainfall totals could go beyond 20 inches.\n\nThe heavy rain has put French Quarter Creek in Huger at major flood stage, the National Weather Service said. Homes located along the creek could get inundated with 1-2 feet of water.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials warned that the Edisto River was predicted to reach major flood stage by Sunday morning at around 15 feet. Authorities in Colleton, Dorchester and Charleston counties went door-to-door Wednesday warning residents along the river to prepare for flooding.\n\nThe Live 5 Weather team has declared First Alert Weather Days from Monday through Thursday.\n\nInland areas could see between five to 10 inches of rain, but coastal communities could see as many as 20 inches or more, which is expected to cause flooding. The system will likely stall out over the Lowcountry, which could prolong these issues.\n\nThis rainfall could result in areas of flash and urban flooding, with isolated river flooding possible.\n\nTropical Storm Debby is expected to make landfall in the overnight hours before it heads up the coast of the United States.\n\nAt 11 p.m. Wednesday, the center of Tropical Storm Debby was located near latitude 32.9 North, longitude 79.5 West, about 25 miles east-northeast of Charleston and about 65 miles south of Myrtle Beach.\n\nDebby has been drifting northeastward near 3 mph. This general motion is expected to continue through Thursday, bringing the center across the South Carolina coast during the next several hours. A faster motion toward the north and north-northeast across the Carolinas and the U.S. Mid-Atlantic states is expected later Thursday and Friday.\n\nMaximum sustained winds are near 60 mph with higher gusts. Weakening is forecast to begin on Thursday after the center moves inland. Debby is expected to merge with a frontal boundary over the U.S. Mid-Atlantic states on Friday or Friday night.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles mainly to the east of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure is 994 mb or 29.36 inches.", "source": {"uri": "live5news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.live5news.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

On Monday, the storm came ashore along Florida's Big Bend region before moving across Georgia and meandering along the Atlantic coast.\n\nDebby is expected to drop 4 to 8 inches of rain - some areas could pick up to 15 inches -across parts of the Carolinas and Virginia on Thursday and Friday. One to 3 inches of rain per hour is possible, quickly adding up to half a foot by Thursday morning, according to the weather service. Heavier totals were \"not out of the question,\" the weather service said.\n\n\"Numerous to widespread areas of flash flooding are expected to continue in association with Debby, with considerable to locally catastrophic impacts,\" the weather service's Storm Prediction Center said. \"This will include a significant urban flash flood threat from Greensboro to the Raleigh-Durham area, with areas near and to the north of Wilmington also at risk.\"\n\nDebby is forecast to weaken as it picks up speed and moves farther northward, dumping up to half an inch of rain from Maryland through Upstate New York and Vermont. Flood watches were active throughout the Mid-Atlantic.\n\nThe storm has drenched Florida, Georgia and South Carolina in over a foot of rain. Some areas of South Carolina are expected to reach well over 2 feet by the weekend. Flash flooding triggered water rescues, overtook roads and breached several dams as winds knocked over trees and tangled power lines. Officials have said at least six people have died as a result of the storm.\n\nDevelopments:\n\n\u220e Overnight, a tornado touched down in North Carolina's Sampson County, damaging two homes, according to weather service reports. Two suspected tornadoes were reported in Pender and Wilson counties, and one caused \"extensive damage\" to a middle school outside Greensboro.\n\n\u220e More than 81,000 homes and utility customers across North Carolina were without power Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us\n\n\u220e Millions of people from southeast Georgia up though the Carolinas and western New York were under flood advisories, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of North Carolina and Virginia, including the cities of Wakefield and Virginia Beach, were under tornado watches.\n\nDebby tracker map: See tropical storm's path as it's projected to push northeast\n\nWhere is Tropical Storm Debby?\n\nTropical Storm Debby was located 50 miles north-northeast of Charleston and 60 miles southwest of Myrtle Beach, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nMoving northwest at 5 mph, Debby has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph, the hurricane center said. Debby is forecast to weaken over the next day or so, becoming a tropical depression by as early as Thursday afternoon before merging with a front on Friday and being downgraded to a extratropical

Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It was still a tropical storm Thursday morning, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nDebby wasn't done flooding parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina, and an additional 3 to 9 inches (8 to 23 centimeters) of rain is possible as the storm moves north, raising concerns of flash floods in mountainous areas of Virginia and West Virginia.\n\nDebby also could bring more tornadoes Thursday in parts of North Carolina and Virginia, forecasters said. At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.\n\nOne person died in a home damaged by the tornado in Lucama, North Carolina, Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email. No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nTheresa Richardson hunkered down with her husband and granddaughter in the closet of their Lucama home as the tornado tore through about a mile away.\n\nDebris struck the house. And they could hear the roof of nearby Springfield Middle School being ripped off. The home of one of her granddaughter's friends was destroyed from the tornado.\n\nRichardson said this wasn't the first time the area was struck by a tornado -- her neighbors call the road they live on \"Tornado Alley.\"\n\nThe superintendent of Wilson County Schools confirmed damage at Springfield Middle School, where sections of the walls and roof of the 6th and 7th grade halls are gone or compromised.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking to see the school right after the event,\" Superintendent Lane Mills said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Lucama, deputies in Bladenboro had posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree as well as roads that had been washed out. Standing water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny North Carolina town.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. He had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Aiken resident's search for Amelia Earhart featured in Discovery Channel documentary Wonder what's going to happen with Hotel Aiken?

We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nThe neighbors on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least seven people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news",

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby is expected to return to land over an already soggy South Carolina coast early Thursday before picking up speed and moving north.\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, according to the National Hurricane Center. Parts of eastern South Carolina have already seen 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain, while parts of southeast North Carolina have recorded 15 inches (38 centimeters).\n\nDebby, which first made landfall in Florida early Monday and has moved slowly ever since, will speed up as it heads to the north and north-northeast across the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic states later Thursday and on Friday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The National Weather Service's office in Charleston also said survey teams confirmed four-Debby related tornadoes.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday night, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east-northeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

It's a lesson learned the hard way. Taylor estimates this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home. He said it is an annoyance, but one he is trying to get used to.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned that isolated areas could see up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain from Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nFor Georgia homeowners in suburban Pooler west of Savannah, the drenching came with a dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, rain from Hurricane Matthew overwhelmed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the inland neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding.\n\nBut residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite efforts by the local government to fix them.\n\nDebby also rained on residents all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another storm system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\nUp to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some New York City neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in New York City and surrounding areas.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio by Wednesday afternoon following severe storms there, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\n'Imminent failure' of dam\n\nMeanwhile, the \"imminent failure\" of a dam in southeast Georgia was threatening to swamp a mobile home park and other areas downstream, the National Weather Service said in a flash flood warning Wednesday afternoon. The Cypress Lake Dam is in Bulloch County, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of Savannah.\n\n\"If the dam breaks, flash flooding will occur immediately downstream of the dam,\" the weather service said.\n\nIn South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster said the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nCredit : Voice of

Heavy rain, flash flooding in forecast.", "body": "While the latest forecast track for Tropical Storm Debby, which made a second landfall early Thursday, has the remnants of the storm passing west of New Jersey, the threat of tornadoes and damaging winds Friday have increased for the state.\n\nThe rainfall total forecasts have dropped due to the change in path, but areas of New Jersey already saturated from storm this week will be prone to additional flash flooding, according to the National Weather Service. Gusty winds could top 50 mph along the Jersey Shore.\n\n\"Some tornadoes are the main threat,\" the National Weather Service's office in New Jersey said early Thursday. \"A more inland track of the remnants of Debby places our region in the more favorable zone for the tornado risk.\"\n\nIsolated severe thunderstorms are also possible. At the beaches, wind gusts of 35-50 mph are possible and there's a moderate risk of rip currents.\n\nNorthwestern areas of New Jersey could get an additional 2 to 3 inches of rain by Friday night. An inch to 2 inches of rain is likely fall along the Interstate 95 corridor, while Jersey Shore areas are left with up to another inch. Forecasters caution that those amounts could wind up higher in areas where the strongest storms set up.\n\nWinds inland are expected to be range from 15 to 25 mph with gusts of 30 to 40 mph.\n\nFlash flooding on Friday is most likely to occur north and west of the Interstate 95 corridor. Some river flooding is also possible.\n\nThe first bands of Debby's remnants should push into New Jersey on Thursday afternoon. A cloudy day with some rain is expected and highs will be in the mid 70s, the weather service said in its morning forecast discussion.\n\nThere could be rain overnight, but the most direct impacts from Debby won't be felt until Friday.\n\nOnce Debby is gone, the good news is that an extended stretch of dry, sunny, less humid weather arrives on Saturday. Highs both weekend days will be in the low-to-mid 80s.\n\nTropical Storm Debby made a second landfall in South Carolina on its way up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend.\n\nDebby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It is now a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph.\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 9 inches of rain forecast, as well as in portions of Virginia, according to the hurricane center.\n\nAs of 5 a.m. Debby was centered 30 miles north-northeast of Charleston, South Carolina packing. The storm was headed northwest at 5 mph.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

The storm, which started as a Category 1 hurricane on Florida's Gulf Coast, has resulted in six deaths. Emergency declarations are in effect in the Carolinas, Florida, and Georgia.\n\nTropical Storm Debby made landfall early Thursday on the South Carolina coast, unleashing more rain and heightening flash flooding fears in areas already soaked by the slow-moving weather system. Forecasters warned that the storm could dump an additional 9 inches of rain in parts of eastern South Carolina, potentially exceeding 25 inches in total accumulative rainfall since Monday.\n\nWhile Wednesday saw a slight reprieve, meteorologist Rich Bann from the National Weather Service emphasized that Thursday would be different. 'Moisture has pulsed back into Debby,' Bann stated, noting that the storm gathered strength over the Atlantic Ocean off the Georgia and South Carolina coastlines. 'As Debby moves inland, heavy rains will exacerbate flooding concerns.'\n\nBy Friday, Debby is expected to bring up to 4 inches of rain across Virginia and Pennsylvania, heightening flooding risks in already saturated areas. The weekend may see similar rainfall in central New York state and northern Vermont. Currently located 20 miles northeast of Charleston and moving northwest with 50 mph sustained winds, Debby is forecast to weaken as it progresses inland, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nThe storm has already claimed six lives in Florida and Georgia and led to emergency declarations in the Carolinas, Florida, and Georgia. The severe weather has submerged neighborhoods, washed out streets, and inundated homes across the region.\n\nEmergency management officials are monitoring the situation closely as rainwater draining into river systems poses additional flooding risks. The National Water Prediction Service has forecast that seven waterways are expected to reach major flood levels before the storm subsides.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfall", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landfall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolinas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carolinas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffir\u2013Simpson_scale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saffir\u2013Simpson scale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flash flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severe weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_sustained_wind", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maximum sustained wind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hurricane_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hurricane Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Tropical_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Tropical Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/04_08_2024_02_06_47_5216403.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799531", "eventUri": "eng-9799531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The deluges have engorged rivers, flooded roadways and trapped people in cars, homes and boats - and potentially dangerous heat is expected across the region in the coming days, threatening to complicate the recovery process.\n\nEven more chaos is on the horizon as the storm, a reflection of the amplifying consequences of human-fueled climate change, heads toward the Northeast. Here's the latest:\n\n* Search and rescue ongoing after damaging tornado: A tornado tore through part of North Carolina's Wilson County in the earliest hours of Thursday morning, leaving behind damage to a middle school, a church and multiple homes, officials said. Rescue crews are combing through one of these homes, which appears to have collapsed and is severely damaged, hoping to locate a missing person, a county spokesperson told CNN.\n\n* At least 11 tornadoes confirmed: Debby has whipped up at least 11 tornadoes confirmed by the National Weather Service as of early Thursday. That includes four tornadoes in Florida, four in South Carolina and three in North Carolina. In addition to the Wilson County tornado, the service warned of a tornado in Snow Hill, North Carolina, early Thursday, describing it as \"large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly.\" Another tornado was observed Thursday morning near Louisburg in the northern part of the state. A tornado watch remains in effect for than 5 million people in parts of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, including the cities of Raleigh and Virginia Beach.\n\n* Flash flood emergency: Debby's torrential rainfall cut off one North Carolina town from its surrounding areas after up to 8 inches of rain fell in just a few hours Wednesday night, according to a rare flash flood emergency issued by the National Weather Service. Officials in Bladenboro - located in the southern part of the state - reported 3 foot deep floodwater.\n\n*Debby's current path: The storm started to pick up speed and lost some strength Thursday morning after landfall as a 50 mph storm near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. It will continue to weaken as it moves into North Carolina by Thursday evening and into northern Virginia by Friday morning. Debby will accelerate through Pennsylvania and New York by Friday evening and through New England by early Saturday afternoon, bringing heavy rains and flash flooding to a region drenched by storms earlier this week.\n\n* 'Be prepared for a deluge,' North Carolina governor says: Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents Wednesday to brace for major rain and flooding. \"All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge,\" Cooper said, describing the incoming threat as \"more rain than most of us see in a month, or even several months.\" Rainfall totals across the state could reach as high as 15 inches. Dangerous rip currents and storm surge up to 3 feet will persist along the Carolinas' coasts Thursday.\n\n* Disaster declarations across the Southeast: President Joe Biden has approved disaster declarations for Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas - all of which have been pummeled by Debby this week. More than 700 Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel have been deployed to the Southeast, and search and rescue teams are on standby to assist as needed, the agency said Wednesday.\n\n* Georgia dam at risk of 'imminent failure': A dam in Bulloch County, Georgia - about 50 miles northwest of Savannah - is in danger of \"imminent failure\" as a result of Debby's torrential rainfall, the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, said. Parts of the county have already suffered serious flooding, requiring water rescues in a mobile home park. But if the dam breaks, communities immediately downstream are at the greatest risk for more flooding and may be asked to evacuate.\n\n* Triple-digit heat in store for Southeast: Potentially dangerous heat has been hovering over the Southeast in Debby's wake and is expected to persist Thursday and through the weekend as storm recovery continues. While high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s are expected, the heat indices - how the body feels under combined heat and humidity - could exceed 110 degrees, including in Steinhatchee, Florida, near where Debby made its first landfall.\n\n'It's like National Geographic in our backyard'\n\nDebby's deluge has been a clear illustration of the impact of global warming caused by fossil fuel pollution, which is causing storms to get wetter and strengthen more quickly. Debby, for instance, tracked through near-record warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, which helped it rapidly intensify before making landfall as a hurricane in Florida.\n\nAs Debby has churned through the Southeast, the storm has left behind disastrous scenes. Homes have been shredded by winds and swamped by floodwaters, and roads have been washed out or submerged, creating hazardous conditions for impacted communities.\n\nIn South Carolina's Lowcountry, a home in Bluffton has become an alligator's paradise as floodwaters turned Adrienne LeBlanc's yard into an inviting swampland.\n\nThough LeBlanc is no stranger to alligators - often seeing them sunbathing in the distance - she was surprised to wake up after heavy rains Wednesday to discover her backyard had been invaded by alligators.\n\n\"It's like National Geographic in our backyard right now,\" LeBlanc told CNN. She counted eight alligators swimming around her house and saw a few of them wrestling.\n\n\"Jokingly I told my husband, 'When I wake up tomorrow that bad boy is going to be in our bedroom,'\" LeBlanc said.\n\nAfter 17 years of living in Bluffton, LeBlanc said she has experienced this level of flooding once - when Hurricane Matthew made landfall in the state in 2016.\n\nSouth Carolina hasn't seen a named storm make landfall on its shores since Hurricane Ian's arrival in 2022 as a Category 1 storm. The last named storm to track across the state in any fashion was Tropical Storm Idalia in August 2023.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nCNN's Andy Rose, Sharif Paget, Mary Gilbert and Kara Mihm contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Rainfall totals could reach 15 inches (38 cm) in southeastern North Carolina and 10 inches (25 cm) in parts of Virginia.\n\nWhile Debby produced less rain on Wednesday than the previous days, it could pick up again on Thursday, said Rich Bann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.\n\n\"Moisture has pulsed back into Debby,\" Bann said, as it spent the last day parked over the Atlantic Ocean. \"As Debby makes its way inland ... the threat of heavy rains will lead to flooding concerns.\"\n\nMoving northwest at 7 miles per hour (11 km per hour) with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph), Debby is likely to weaken into a tropical depression on Thursday afternoon or evening as its rains spread northward.\n\nIn the coming days, it will soak through Maryland, Washington, upstate New York and Vermont, although rainfall totals will moderate.\n\nMore than 140,000 customers were without power in the Carolinas on Thursday morning, according to the tracking site, Poweroutage.us. About 7,000 remained without power in Florida, down from a peak of 350,000.\n\nAn apparent tornado tore through eastern North Carolina and damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County, North Carolina, early on Thursday morning, NBC affiliate WITN reported. The system could spawn tornadoes in the region on Thursday, the hurricane center said.\n\nBy the weekend, Debby could produce up to 6 inches (15 cm) of rain from Maryland into northern Vermont. But New York City will avoid the worst of the storm, said Josh Weiss, a forecaster with the weather service.\n\nIn Bulloch County, Georgia, about 50 miles (80 km) northwest of Savannah, four dams burst on Wednesday as a result of floodwaters, and officials warned the Cypress Lake Dam was at risk of failure on Thursday morning.\n\nThat forced the evacuation of local residents after homes were flooded and roads made impassable as lakes and creeks overflowed, the Bulloch County Sheriff's Office reported.\n\nEmergency management officials were keeping a close watch as rainwater drained into the numerous river systems in the Carolinas over the coming days, presenting the risk of major flooding long after the storm exited.\n\n(Reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta and Brad Brooks in Colorado;

(AP) -- Days of rain forced the deluge-hardened residents of a South Carolina community to begin the near-ritualistic task of assessing damage left behind by Tropical Storm Debby, which continued spinning over the Atlantic Ocean and influencing thunderstorms from the East Coast to the Great Lakes on Wednesday.\n\nIn Huger, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, Gene Taylor was waiting in the afternoon for a few inches of water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed.\n\nTaylor saw the potential for flooding last week and started moving belongings out or up higher in his home. It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned that isolated areas could see up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain from Debby.\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no fatalities have been reported so far, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumpred rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon following severe storms there, according to PowerOutage.us. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said.\n\nAct 2 was to arrive overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bands develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday evening, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east-southeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the Brown Dog Deli closed early Monday and couldn't open Tuesday due to a curfew decreed by local officials. On Wednesday the lunch crowd poured in after days of storm preparations and hunkering down. The first words from the person answering the phone were: \"Yes, we're open.\"\n\n\"We've got a lot of locals walking in after being cooped up for two days looking for a good meal,\" kitchen manager Liz Denney said.\n\nSome water got around the sandbags that employees placed Monday, but the restaurant has had worse flooding other times in the past year, Denney said. The standing water and the occasional interruption, she added, is just part of living on the coast.\n\n\"It comes with the territory,\" Denney said.\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

The tornado damaged homes and a school in the area, which is around 35 miles southeast of Raleigh.\n\nTrack the storm: Debby's path\n\nSince crashing into Florida as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday, Debby has dumped more than a foot of rain over parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The deluges have engorged rivers, flooded roadways and trapped people in cars, homes and boats - and potentially dangerous heat is expected across the region in the coming days, threatening to complicate the recovery process.\n\nEven more chaos is on the horizon as the storm, a reflection of the amplifying consequences of human-fueled climate change, heads toward the Northeast. Here's the latest:\n\n* Debby's death toll climbs: One person is dead after a tornado spawned by Debby tore through part of North Carolina's Wilson County in the earliest hours of Thursday morning, leaving behind damage to a middle school, a church and multiple homes. A man was killed after his home in the town of Lucama collapsed, a county spokesperson told CNN. At least four people in Florida and one in Georgia were also killed by Debby.\n\n* At least 11 tornadoes confirmed: Debby has whipped up at least 11 tornadoes confirmed by the National Weather Service as of early Thursday. That includes four tornadoes in Florida, four in South Carolina and three in North Carolina. In addition to the Wilson County tornado, the service warned of a tornado in Snow Hill, North Carolina, early Thursday, describing it as \"large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly.\" Another tornado was observed Thursday morning near Louisburg in the northern part of the state. A tornado watch remains in effect for than 5 million people in parts of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, including the cities of Raleigh and Virginia Beach.\n\n* Flash flood emergency: Debby's torrential rainfall cut off one North Carolina town from its surrounding areas after up to 8 inches of rain fell in just a few hours Wednesday night, according to a rare flash flood emergency issued by the National Weather Service. Officials in Bladenboro - located in the southern part of the state - reported 3 foot deep floodwater.\n\n* Debby's current path: The storm started to pick up speed and lost some strength Thursday morning after landfall as a 50 mph storm near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. It will continue to weaken as it moves into North Carolina by Thursday evening and into northern Virginia by Friday morning. Debby will accelerate through Pennsylvania and New York by Friday evening and through New England by early Saturday afternoon, bringing heavy rains and flash flooding to a region drenched by storms earlier this week.\n\n* 'Be prepared for a deluge,' North Carolina governor says: Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents Wednesday to brace for major rain and flooding. \"All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge,\" Cooper said, describing the incoming threat as \"more rain than most of us see in a month, or even several months.\" Rainfall totals across the state could reach as high as 15 inches. Dangerous rip currents and storm surge up to 3 feet will persist along the Carolinas' coasts Thursday.\n\n* Disaster declarations across the Southeast: President Joe Biden has approved disaster declarations for Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas - all of which have been pummeled by Debby this week. More than 700 Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel have been deployed to the Southeast, and search and rescue teams are on standby to assist as needed, the agency said Wednesday.\n\n* Georgia dam at risk of 'imminent failure': A dam in Bulloch County, Georgia - about 50 miles northwest of Savannah - is in danger of \"imminent failure\" as a result of Debby's torrential rainfall, the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, said. Parts of the county have already suffered serious flooding, requiring water rescues in a mobile home park. But if the dam breaks, communities immediately downstream are at the greatest risk for more flooding and may be asked to evacuate.\n\n* Triple-digit heat in store for Southeast: Potentially dangerous heat has been hovering over the Southeast in Debby's wake and is expected to persist Thursday and through the weekend as storm recovery continues. While high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s are expected, the heat indices - how the body feels under combined heat and humidity - could exceed 110 degrees, including in Steinhatchee, Florida, near where Debby made its first landfall.\n\n'It's like National Geographic in our backyard'\n\nDebby's deluge has been a clear illustration of the impact of global warming caused by fossil fuel pollution, which is causing storms to get wetter and strengthen more quickly. Debby, for instance, tracked through near-record warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, which helped it rapidly intensify before making landfall as a hurricane in Florida.\n\nAs Debby has churned through the Southeast, the storm has left behind disastrous scenes. Homes have been shredded by winds and swamped by floodwaters, and roads have been washed out or submerged, creating hazardous conditions for impacted communities.\n\nIn South Carolina's Lowcountry, a home in Bluffton has become an alligator's paradise as floodwaters turned Adrienne LeBlanc's yard into an inviting swampland.\n\nThough LeBlanc is no stranger to alligators - often seeing them sunbathing in the distance - she was surprised to wake up after heavy rains Wednesday to discover her backyard had been invaded by alligators.\n\n\"It's like National Geographic in our backyard right now,\" LeBlanc told CNN. She counted eight alligators swimming around her house and saw a few of them wrestling.\n\n\"Jokingly I told my husband, 'When I wake up tomorrow that bad boy is going to be in our bedroom,'\" LeBlanc said.\n\nAfter 17 years of living in Bluffton, LeBlanc said she has experienced this level of flooding once - when Hurricane Matthew made landfall in the state in 2016.\n\nSouth Carolina hasn't seen a named storm make landfall on its shores since Hurricane Ian's arrival in 2022 as a Category 1 storm. The last named storm to track across the state in any fashion was Tropical Storm Idalia in August 2023.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nCNN's Andy Rose, Sharif Paget, Mary Gilbert and Kara Mihm contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend.\n\nDebby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It is now a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 80 km/h.\n\nWhile Debby produced less rain on Wednesday than the previous days, Rich Bann, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service warned that Thursday would be different.\n\n\"Moisture has pulsed back into Debby,\" Bann said, noting that the storm picked up water as it spent the last day parked over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Georgia and South Carolina. \"As Debby makes its way inland ... the threat of heavy rains will lead to flooding concerns.\"\n\nBann said that by Friday Debby would be dumping up to 10 centimetres of rain on Virginia up into Pennsylvania, where ground in some patches was already soaked from other storms this week, heightening flooding concerns there. By the weekend, the storm could also produce rain of up to 10 centimetres in central New York state and into northern Vermont.\n\nDebby was located about 35 kilometres northeast of Charleston and moving about seven km/h toward the northwest, with maximum sustained winds of 85 km/h.\n\nAdditional weakening is forecast today as the storm's centre moves farther inland, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nAt least six people have died in Florida and Georgia in the wake of the storm, which made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and headed northeast.\n\nGovernors in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia have declared states of emergency.

The deluges have engorged rivers, flooded roadways and trapped people in cars, homes and boats.\n\nEven more chaos is on the horizon as the storm heads toward the Northeast. Here's the latest:\n\n* Debby's current path: After landfall, the storm will finally begin to pick up speed. It is on track to move into North Carolina by Thursday evening and into northern Virginia by Friday morning. Debby is then forecasted to accelerate into Pennsylvania and New York by Friday evening and through New England by early Saturday afternoon, bringing heavy rains and flash flooding to a region drenched by storms earlier this week.\n\n* \"Be prepared for a deluge,\" North Carolina governor says: North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents Wednesday to brace for major rains and flooding. \"All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge,\" Cooper said, describing the incoming threat as \"more rain than most of us see in a month, or even several months.\" Rainfall totals across the state could reach as high as 15 inches and South Carolina could see totals approaching 25 inches. Dangerous rip currents and storm surges of up to 3 feet are possible along the Carolinas' coasts.\n\n* At least 10 tornadoes confirmed: Debby has whipped up at least 10 tornadoes that have been confirmed by the National Weather Service as of early Thursday. That includes four tornadoes in Florida, four in South Carolina and two in North Carolina. The service warned of a tornado in Snow Hill, North Carolina, early Thursday, describing it as \"large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly.\" About 30 miles north, in Wilson County, a tornado scattered roads with debris and damaged multiple buildings, including a middle school and at least 10 homes, officials said. There were no injuries reported, county officials said in a social media post early Thursday.\n\n* Tornado watches issued in North Carolina and Virginia: Tornado watches have been issued for parts of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia. More than 5 million people are impacted, including the cities of Raleigh and Virginia Beach. \"The tornado threat with Debby is expected to gradually expand northward and somewhat westward through midday, while lingering for several more hours,\" the Storm Prediction Center said. Tornado warnings were also in effect across portions of North Carolina early Thursday. Damage has been reported in Wilson, Wade, Nash and Green counties.\n\n* Disaster declarations across the Southeast: President Joe Biden has approved disaster declarations for Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas - all of which have been pummeled by Debby this week. More than 700 Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel have been deployed to the Southeast, and search and rescue teams are on standby to assist as needed, the agency said Wednesday.\n\n* Georgia dam at risk of \"imminent failure\": A dam in Bulloch County, Georgia - about 50 miles northwest of Savannah - is in danger of \"imminent failure\" as a result of Debby's torrential rainfall, the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, said. Parts of the county have already suffered serious flooding, requiring water rescues in a mobile home park. But if the dam breaks, communities immediately downstream are at the greatest risk for more flooding and may be asked to evacuate.\n\n* Triple-digit heat in store for Southeast: Potentially dangerous heat has been hovering over the Southeast in Debby's wake and is expected to persist Thursday and through the weekend as storm recovery continues. While high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s are expected, the heat indices - how the body feels under combined heat and humidity - could exceed 110 degrees. The heat index in Steinhatchee, Florida, near where Debby made its first landfall, could hit 113 degrees on Thursday.\n\n'It's like National Geographic in our backyard'\n\nAs Debby has churned through the Southeast, the storm has left behind disastrous scenes. Homes have been shredded by winds and swamped by floodwaters, and roads have been washed out or submerged, creating hazardous conditions for impacted communities.\n\nIn South Carolina's Lowcountry, a home in Bluffton has become an alligator's paradise as floodwaters have turned Adrienne LeBlanc's yard into an inviting swampland.\n\nThough LeBlanc is no stranger to alligators - often seeing them sunbathing in the distance - she was surprised to wake up after heavy rains Wednesday to discover her backyard had been invaded by alligators.\n\n\"It's like National Geographic in our backyard right now,\" LeBlanc told CNN. She counted eight alligators swimming around her house, and saw a few of them wrestling.\n\n\"Jokingly I told my husband, 'When I wake up tomorrow that bad boy is going to be in our bedroom,'\" LeBlanc said.\n\nAfter 17 years of living in Bluffton, LeBlanc said she has experienced this level of flooding once - when Hurricane Matthew made landfall in the state in 2016.\n\nSouth Carolina hasn't seen a named storm make landfall on its shores since Hurricane Ian's arrival in 2022 as a Category 1 storm. The last named storm to track across the state in any fashion was Tropical Storm Idalia in August 2023.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nCNN's Andy Rose, Sharif Paget, Mary Gilbert and Kara Mihm contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

of the Carolinas, mid-Atlantic and Northeast, forecasters say.\n\nTropical Storm Debby -- which has been drenching parts of the Southeast after making landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in Florida's Big Bend region earlier this week -- made a second landfall, in South Carolina, bringing with it more heavy rain and the threat of severe flooding, forecasters say.\n\nWhere is the storm, exactly?\n\nAccording to an update from the National Hurricane Center on Thursday, Debby was slowly churning in the Atlantic about 65 miles off the South Carolina coast.\n\nThe storm is expected to accelerate across South Carolina and North Carolina Thursday before moving through the mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Friday, NHC forecasters say.\n\nWhat are the biggest risks associated with Debby?\n\nRain and storm surge, forecasters say.\n\nDebby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 9 inches of rainfall with locally higher amounts, leading to maximum storm total amounts as high as 25 inches in parts of the Carolinas through Friday.\n\nIn addition, the \"combination of storm surge and tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline,\" the hurricane center said.\n\nWhere is the greatest risk for flooding right now?\n\nAlong the Carolina coast, the water level could reach 1 to 3 feet above ground \"if the peak surge occurs at the time of high tide,\" the hurricane center warned.\n\nWhat other areas could see impacts from Tropical Storm Debby?\n\nDebby is expected to merge with a frontal boundary over the mid-Atlantic on Friday, bringing heavy rain and the potential for flash flooding from Virginia to Vermont through the weekend.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

It's producing scattered bands of heavy rain from eastern Georgia and South Carolina to southern Virginia.\n\nSome drier air wrapped into Debby, so it lacks the well-organized core of deep thunderstorms near its center that most other tropical storms have.\n\nWhere it's headed: Debby's center will make its final landfall in South Carolina early Thursday, with little additional strengthening expected before then.\n\nAfter that, Debby's remnant will move faster and sweep through the mid-Atlantic and interior Northeast Friday into early Saturday while interacting with a pair of fronts, resulting in pockets of locally heavy rain across those regions.\n\nBands of locally heavy rain are likely along and to the east of Debby's center through at least Thursday night in parts of the Carolinas and southern Virginia. These bands could lead to additional flash flooding and could worsen ongoing river flooding.\n\nThe areas most at risk for additional heavy rain Thursday are shown in the red and pink contours, below.\n\nThis threat should become more isolated by Friday, though river flooding may linger for days in the hardest hit areas.\n\nNortheast\n\nParts of the region have been soaked multiple times this week either by rounds of severe thunderstorms, or clusters of heavy rain, such as what affected the New York City Tri-state area Tuesday.\n\nWhile isolated pockets of locally heavy rain are possible in the Northeast through Thursday night, the main threat for more widespread heavy rainfall will be from Friday into Friday night, particularly from the Appalachians to upstate New York and Vermont, in the areas shaded in red on the map below.\n\nAbout a month ago, the remnant from what was once Hurricane Beryl triggered major flash flooding from upstate New York to Vermont, northern New Hampshire and Maine, washing out roads and flooding some towns.\n\nIf you live in a low-lying flood-prone area, stay alert and follow the latest updates and warnings. Never attempt to drive through a flooded stretch of road or around barriers that signal a road closure. Over half of deaths in floods happen in vehicles, according to NOAA statistics.\n\nHow much more rain:\n\nWind threat: Tropical storm warnings cover parts of South Carolina to southeast North Carolina as far north as Surf City, as shown below. The warnings include Charleston and Myrtle Beach.\n\nTropical storm conditions (39 to 73 mph sustained winds) could last into Thursday in these areas.\n\nStronger wind gusts over 40 mph, coupled with increasingly soaked ground from heavy rain, will trigger more power outages, downed trees and tree damage.\n\nStorm surge threat: Inundation from storm surge could reach 1 to 3 feet above ground level if the peak surge arrives at high tide from the northeast South Carolina coast to Ocracoke Inlet, including the lower Neuse and Pamlico Rivers. High tides along the coast are generally around 10 a.m. and p.m. EDT.\n\nIsolated tornado threat: Wednesday night, a tornado or two could spin up from northeast South Carolina into eastern North Carolina.\n\nThursday's chance for a few tornadoes will be in eastern North Carolina and southeast Virginia.\n\nWe can't rule out an isolated tornado again Friday from near Chesapeake Bay to the Delaware Valley and New Jersey.\n\nRecap\n\nDry air kept it from developing for days as it tracked toward the northern Caribbean Islands. Eventually, it sprouted enough showers and thunderstorms, and prompted the NHC to designate Tropical Depression Four at 11 p.m. EDT on Aug. 2 near Cuba.\n\nIt then strengthened into Tropical Storm Debby late on Aug. 3 in the southeast Gulf of Mexico.\n\nDebby intensified into a hurricane at 11 p.m. on Aug. 4 ahead of its Category 1 landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, on the morning of Aug. 5. That was just 15 miles away from where Hurricane Idalia made landfall along Florida's Big Bend last August.\n\nDebby then moved inland over north Florida into southern Georgia, slowing its forward speed, before emerging back over the ocean just off the coast of South Carolina on Aug. 6.\n\nBy that time, Debby had begun ingesting some dry air, which not only had reduced the coverage of heaviest rainbands, but also limited its potential to restrengthen while over water.\n\nRainfall\n\nDebby dumped over 10 inches of rain over many areas from western and northern Florida into eastern Georgia and South Carolina. The peak rainfall tally was 19.67 inches near Lake City, Florida.\n\nFlash flooding and river flooding swamped some homes, washed out roads and stranded vehicles. Among the hardest hit areas were parts of Manatee and Sarasota Counties, Florida; Live Oak, Florida; near Statesboro, Georgia; and Colleton County, South Carolina, where a 20-acre pond was drained after two holes were punched in dikes surrounding the pond.\n\nThe Manatee River just east of Bradenton, Florida (Rye Bridge), topped its previous record flood crest from July 21, 1962. That was just one of over a dozen river gauges that rose to moderate or major flood stage from Florida to the Carolinas.\n\nStorm Surge\n\nDebby pushed Gulf water into the Florida coast as a tropical storm and hurricane, adding to the storm's water impact.\n\nThis storm surge hit some of the same areas affected by Idalia almost one year ago, but likely not nearly matching the 8 to 12-foot inundation above ground of Idalia from Keaton Beach to Steinhatchee.\n\nCedar Key, Florida, had a storm surge of up to 5.8 feet above normal tide levels, equating to a peak inundation of about 4.65 feet above ground level as Hurricane Debby made landfall on Aug. 5.\n\nFarther south, the combination of a new moon, high tide and Debby lead to a peak inundation at Ft. Myers, Florida, higher than Idalia and Irma, according to WINK-TV meteorlogist Matt Devitt, at just over 3 feet above ground level.\n\nDebby produced wind gusts of at least 70 mph near Chiefland (76 mph), Dania Beach (73 mph) and near Palmetto (70 mph).\n\nGusts over 60 mph were clocked at Cedar Key, Sarasota-Bradenton Airport (63 mph) and at Folly Beach, South Carolina (63 mph).\n\nAt the peak of the storm, over 300,000 customers were without power from Florida to the Carolinas.\n\nTornadoes\n\nAs with most landfalling hurricanes and tropical storms, some tornadoes were spawned across the Southeast within Debby's rainbands.\n\nAt least two tornadoes were spawned in the Lowcountry of South Carolina on the night of Aug. 5. That included and EF1 tornado in Edisto Beach and another damaging twister in Moncks Corner.\n\nTwo days later, at least one, possibly two separate tornadoes spin through eastern North Carolina, damaging homes in Sampson County and tossing debris onto a highway in Pender County, north of Wilmington.", "source": {"uri": "weather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Weather Channel"},

The deluges have engorged rivers, flooded roadways and trapped people in cars, homes and boats.\n\nEven more chaos is on the horizon as the storm heads toward the Northeast. Here's the latest:\n\n* Debby's current path: After landfall, the storm will finally begin to pick up speed. It is on track to move into North Carolina by Thursday evening and into northern Virginia by Friday morning. Debby is then forecasted to accelerate into Pennsylvania and New York by Friday evening and through New England by early Saturday afternoon, bringing heavy rains and flash flooding to a region drenched by storms earlier this week.\n\n* \"Be prepared for a deluge,\" North Carolina governor says: North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents Wednesday to brace for major rains and flooding. \"All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge,\" Cooper said, describing the incoming threat as \"more rain than most of us see in a month, or even several months.\" Rainfall totals across the state could reach as high as 15 inches and South Carolina could see totals approaching 25 inches. Dangerous rip currents and storm surges of up to 3 feet are possible along the Carolinas' coasts.\n\n* At least 10 tornadoes confirmed: Debby has whipped up at least 10 tornadoes that have been confirmed by the National Weather Service as of early Thursday. That includes four tornadoes in Florida, four in South Carolina and two in North Carolina. The service warned of a tornado in Snow Hill, North Carolina, early Thursday, describing it as \"large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly.\" About 30 miles north, in Wilson County, a tornado scattered roads with debris and damaged multiple buildings, including a middle school and at least 10 homes, officials said. There were no injuries reported, county officials said in a social media post early Thursday.\n\n* Tornado watches issued in North Carolina and Virginia: Tornado watches have been issued for parts of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia. More than 5 million people are impacted, including the cities of Raleigh and Virginia Beach. \"The tornado threat with Debby is expected to gradually expand northward and somewhat westward through midday, while lingering for several more hours,\" the Storm Prediction Center said. Tornado warnings were also in effect across portions of North Carolina early Thursday. Damage has been reported in Wilson, Wade, Nash and Green counties.\n\n* Disaster declarations across the Southeast: President Joe Biden has approved disaster declarations for Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas - all of which have been pummeled by Debby this week. More than 700 Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel have been deployed to the Southeast, and search and rescue teams are on standby to assist as needed, the agency said Wednesday.\n\n* Georgia dam at risk of \"imminent failure\": A dam in Bulloch County, Georgia - about 50 miles northwest of Savannah - is in danger of \"imminent failure\" as a result of Debby's torrential rainfall, the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, said. Parts of the county have already suffered serious flooding, requiring water rescues in a mobile home park. But if the dam breaks, communities immediately downstream are at the greatest risk for more flooding and may be asked to evacuate.\n\n* Triple-digit heat in store for Southeast: Potentially dangerous heat has been hovering over the Southeast in Debby's wake and is expected to persist Thursday and through the weekend as storm recovery continues. While high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s are expected, the heat indices - how the body feels under combined heat and humidity - could exceed 110 degrees. The heat index in Steinhatchee, Florida, near where Debby made its first landfall, could hit 113 degrees on Thursday.\n\n'It's like National Geographic in our backyard'\n\nAs Debby has churned through the Southeast, the storm has left behind disastrous scenes. Homes have been shredded by winds and swamped by floodwaters, and roads have been washed out or submerged, creating hazardous conditions for impacted communities.\n\nIn South Carolina's Lowcountry, a home in Bluffton has become an alligator's paradise as floodwaters have turned Adrienne LeBlanc's yard into an inviting swampland.\n\nThough LeBlanc is no stranger to alligators - often seeing them sunbathing in the distance - she was surprised to wake up after heavy rains Wednesday to discover her backyard had been invaded by alligators.\n\n\"It's like National Geographic in our backyard right now,\" LeBlanc told CNN. She counted eight alligators swimming around her house, and saw a few of them wrestling.\n\n\"Jokingly I told my husband, 'When I wake up tomorrow that bad boy is going to be in our bedroom,'\" LeBlanc said.\n\nAfter 17 years of living in Bluffton, LeBlanc said she has experienced this level of flooding once - when Hurricane Matthew made landfall in the state in 2016.\n\nSouth Carolina hasn't seen a named storm make landfall on its shores since Hurricane Ian's arrival in 2022 as a Category 1 storm. The last named storm to track across the state in any fashion was Tropical Storm Idalia in August 2023.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nCNN's Andy Rose, Sharif Paget, Mary Gilbert and Kara Mihm contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors":

The storm has already left neighborhoods and communities underwater with widespread flooding washing out streets and inundating homes across the region.\n\n\"All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge,\" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said at a briefing at the state's Department of Emergency Management on Wednesday.\n\nALSO READ| Man kills dad, leaves organs outside body in one of Connecticut's safest towns: 'Tragedy of Shakespearean dimensions'\n\nOfficials in Charleston, South Carolina, lifted a citywide curfew on Wednesday, saying crews on standby were not needed to conduct any rescues overnight as the worst of the storm passed through.\n\nEven so, the storm could still deliver another 3 to 9 inches (7.6 cm to 23 cm)) of rainfall to the Carolina coast, the National Weather Service said. That would bring rain totals to 25 inches (64 cm) in South Carolina and 15 inches (38 cm) in southeastern North Carolina near Wilmington and coastal Georgia.\n\nDebby was about 55 miles (85 km) southeast of Charleston on Wednesday afternoon and moving northeast about 3 miles per hour (5 km per hour) toward the Northeast, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph (97 kph). It was forecast to make landfall again further north in South Carolina on Thursday morning, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nDebby's greatest threat remains the sheer volume of rain it is dumping on the Eastern Seaboard and the potential for flooding that could continue into next week. In South Carolina, 15 homes had suffered major damage and one had been destroyed as a result of Debby's flooding.\n\nALSO READ| Are the viral Olympics chocolate muffins worth the hype?

This storm surge at Bulls Bay with Hugo is still the highest storm surge the eastern coast of the U.S. has ever recorded.\n\nDebby is forecast to slowly move north through the state, exiting later tonight. The storm will pick up speed on Friday and move into the northeastern U.S. before the weekend.\n\nThursday will still be rainy and windy with conditions improving Friday.\n\nDebby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It is now a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph.\n\nRAIN\n\nConsiderable flooding is expected across parts of eastern South Carolina and southeast North Carolina through Friday, with an additional 3 to 9 inches of rain forecast, as well as in portions of Virginia, according to the hurricane center.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nWIND\n\nWindy conditions will continue through Thursday, though the expected speed will be lower now that Debby is over land. Twenty-five to 35 mph gusts are possible across the entire region.\n\nWinds will fall quickly on Thursday evening and Friday. With all the rain and saturated soil, a few trees could fall, and isolated power outages are still possible as a result.\n\nThe tornado risk will be more focused over eastern North Carolina on Thursday as Debby moves north.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia.

Meahwhile, residents as far away as the Great Lakes and New Jersey have also experienced heavy rains connected to the slow-moving tropical storm.\n\nHere's the Latest:\n\nTropical Storm Debby is heading up the East Coast as it has made landfall for a second time. The National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.\n\nThe storm is expected to keep moving inland, spreading heavy rain and possible flooding all the way up through the mid-Atlantic and the Northeast by the weekend. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida.\n\nAs Debby drenches South Carolina, heavy rainfall from the tropical storm is also expected to cause flooding across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and Northeast through Saturday morning.\n\nIn Bulloch County northwest of Savannah, Georgia, at least four dams have been breached by floodwaters, but so far no fatalities have been reported, authorities said at a Wednesday news briefing.\n\nCharles Grainger cleans up around his house in the historic district of French Quarter Creek as flood waters recede from Tropical Storm Debby, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024, in Huger, S.C. (AP Photo/Mic Smith)\n\nMore than 75 people have been rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, the county\u00b4s director of emergency management. About 100 roads have been closed, he said.\n\n\"We\u00b4ve been faced with a lot of things we\u00b4ve never been faced with before,\" Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I\u00b4m 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It\u00b4s amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nGene Taylor was waiting for a few inches of water to drain back out of his home as high tide passed Wednesday afternoon at his home along French Quarter Creek, not far from the Cooper River in Huger and about 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston.\n\nThis is the fourth time his home's been flooded in the past nine years, and he heeded the warnings this time, moving things up or out.\n\n\"To save everything, we\u00b4ve learned from the past it\u00b4s better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said. \"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn\u00b4t think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn\u00b4t even get the vehicles out.\"\n\nA few doors down, Charles Granger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home - a common annoyance now.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don\u00b4t get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It\u00b4s part of living on the creek.\"\n\nWater levels are rising as Tropical Storm Debby's rainfall drains out to sea. The National Weather Service in Charleston tweeted that the Canoochee River in Claxton, Georgia have neared 18 feet, surpassing previous flood record set in 1925.\n\nNo deaths or injuries have been reported from Tropical Story Debby in South Carolina, but Gov. Henry McMaster said Wednesday that the state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play.\n\n\"We\u00b4ve been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said of heavy rains Monday and Tuesday that caused flooding that damaged over 60 homes but did not cause significant problems to roads or water systems.\n\nAct 2 is overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bans develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nCharles Grainger cleans up around his house in the historic district of French Quarter Creek as flood waters recede from Tropical Storm Debby, Wednesday, Aug. 7, 2024, in Huger, S.C.

The storm is set to unleash more torrential rains, tornadoes and destructive flooding as it marches northward through the rest of the week, inundating several already-soaked states.\n\nAs of 11 p.m. ET Wednesday, Debby's center was 25 miles east-northeast of Charleston and inching forward at just 3 mph, a typical walking speed for many people, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nSince crashing into Florida as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday, Debby has dumped more than a foot of rain over parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The deluges have engorged rivers, flooded roadways and trapped people in cars, homes and boats.\n\nBut even more chaos is on the horizon as the storm heads toward the Northeast. Here's the latest:\n\n* Debby's current path: After landfall, the storm will finally begin to pick up speed. It is on track to move into North Carolina by Thursday evening and into northern Virginia by Friday morning. Debby is then forecasted to accelerate through Pennsylvania by Friday evening and through New England by Saturday morning, bringing heavy rains and flash flooding to a region drenched by storms earlier this week.\n\n* \"Be prepared for a deluge,\" North Carolina governor says: North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents on Wednesday to brace for major rains and flooding. \"All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge,\" Cooper said, describing the incoming threat as \"more rain than most of us see in a month, or even several months.\" A tornado watch has been issued for eastern North Carolina until 8 a.m. Thursday. Rainfall totals across the state could reach as high as 15 inches and South Carolina could see totals approaching 25 inches. Dangerous rip currents and storm surges of up to 3 feet are possible along the Carolinas' coasts.\n\n* Disaster declarations across the Southeast: President Joe Biden has approved disaster declarations for Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas - all of which have been pummeled by Debby this week. More than 700 Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel have been deployed to the Southeast, and search and rescue teams are on standby to assist as needed, the agency said Wednesday.\n\n* Georgia dam at risk of \"imminent failure\": A dam in Bulloch County, Georgia - about 50 miles northwest of Savannah - is in danger of \"imminent failure\" as a result of Debby's torrential rainfall, the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, said. Parts of the county have already suffered serious flooding, requiring water rescues in a mobile home park. But if the dam breaks, communities immediately downstream are at the greatest risk for more flooding and may be asked to evacuate.\n\n* Triple-digit heat in store for Southeast: Potentially dangerous heat has been hovering over the Southeast in Debby's wake and is expected to persist Thursday and through the weekend as storm recovery continues. While high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s are expected, the heat indices - how the body feels under combined heat and humidity - could exceed 110 degrees. The heat index in Steinhatchee, Florida, near where Debby made its first landfall, could hit 113 degrees on Thursday.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nCNN's Andy Rose, Mary

The deluges have engorged rivers, flooded roadways and trapped people in cars, homes and boats - and potentially dangerous heat is expected across the region in the coming days, threatening to complicate the recovery process.\n\nEven more chaos is on the horizon as the storm, a reflection of the amplifying consequences of human-fueled climate change, heads toward the Northeast. Here's the latest:\n\n* Debby's current path: The storm will finally begin to pick up speed. It is on track to move into North Carolina by Thursday evening and into northern Virginia by Friday morning. Debby is then forecasted to accelerate into Pennsylvania and New York by Friday evening and through New England by early Saturday afternoon, bringing heavy rains and flash flooding to a region drenched by storms earlier this week.\n\n* 'Be prepared for a deluge,' North Carolina governor says: Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents Wednesday to brace for major rain and flooding. \"All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge,\" Cooper said, describing the incoming threat as \"more rain than most of us see in a month, or even several months.\" Rainfall totals across the state could reach as high as 15 inches and South Carolina could see totals approaching 25 inches. Dangerous rip currents and storm surges of up to 3 feet are possible along the Carolinas' coasts.\n\n* At least 10 tornadoes confirmed: Debby has whipped up at least 10 tornadoes confirmed by the National Weather Service as of early Thursday. That includes four tornadoes in Florida, four in South Carolina and two in North Carolina. The service warned of a tornado in Snow Hill, North Carolina, early Thursday, describing it as \"large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly.\" About 30 miles north, in Wilson County, a tornado scattered roads with debris and damaged buildings, including a middle school, a church and four homes, officials said. There were no injuries reported, county officials said in a social media post early Thursday.\n\n* Tornado watch issued in North Carolina and Virginia: A tornado watch has been issued for parts of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia. More than 5 million people are impacted, including the cities of Raleigh and Virginia Beach. \"The tornado threat with Debby is expected to gradually expand northward and somewhat westward through midday, while lingering for several more hours,\" the Storm Prediction Center said. Tornado warnings have been issued across portions of North Carolina early Thursday. Damage has been reported in Wilson, Wade, Nash and Green counties.\n\n* Disaster declarations across the Southeast: President Joe Biden has approved disaster declarations for Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas - all of which have been pummeled by Debby this week. More than 700 Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel have been deployed to the Southeast, and search and rescue teams are on standby to assist as needed, the agency said Wednesday.\n\n* Georgia dam at risk of 'imminent failure': A dam in Bulloch County, Georgia - about 50 miles northwest of Savannah - is in danger of \"imminent failure\" as a result of Debby's torrential rainfall, the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, said. Parts of the county have already suffered serious flooding, requiring water rescues in a mobile home park. But if the dam breaks, communities immediately downstream are at the greatest risk for more flooding and may be asked to evacuate.\n\n* Triple-digit heat in store for Southeast: Potentially dangerous heat has been hovering over the Southeast in Debby's wake and is expected to persist Thursday and through the weekend as storm recovery continues. While high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s are expected, the heat indices - how the body feels under combined heat and humidity - could exceed 110 degrees. The heat index in Steinhatchee, Florida, near where Debby made its first landfall, could hit 113 degrees on Thursday.\n\nDebby's deluge has been a clear illustration of the impact of global warming caused by fossil fuel pollution, which is causing storms to get wetter and strengthen more quickly. Debby, for instance, tracked through near-record warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, which helped it rapidly intensify before making landfall as a hurricane in Florida.\n\nAs Debby has churned through the Southeast, the storm has left behind disastrous scenes. Homes have been shredded by winds and swamped by floodwaters, and roads have been washed out or submerged, creating hazardous conditions for impacted communities.\n\nIn South Carolina's Lowcountry, a home in Bluffton has become an alligator's paradise as floodwaters turned Adrienne LeBlanc's yard into an inviting swampland.\n\nThough LeBlanc is no stranger to alligators - often seeing them sunbathing in the distance - she was surprised to wake up after heavy rains Wednesday to discover her backyard had been invaded by alligators.\n\n\"It's like National Geographic in our backyard right now,\" LeBlanc told CNN. She counted eight alligators swimming around her house and saw a few of them wrestling.\n\n\"Jokingly I told my husband, 'When I wake up tomorrow that bad boy is going to be in our bedroom,'\" LeBlanc said.\n\nAfter 17 years of living in Bluffton, LeBlanc said she has experienced this level of flooding once - when Hurricane Matthew made landfall in the state in 2016.\n\nSouth Carolina hasn't seen a named storm make landfall on its shores since Hurricane Ian's arrival in 2022 as a Category 1 storm.

A tornado watch remains in effect for than 5 million people in parts of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia, including the cities of Raleigh and Virginia Beach.\n\n* Flash flood emergency: Debby's torrential rainfall cut off one North Carolina town from its surrounding areas after up to 8 inches of rain fell in just a few hours Wednesday night, according to a rare flash flood emergency issued by the National Weather Service. Officials in Bladenboro - located in the southern part of the state - reported 3 foot deep floodwater.\n\n*Debby's current path: The storm started to pick up speed and lost some strength Thursday morning after landfall as a 50 mph storm near Bulls Bay, South Carolina.

Henry McMaster and several state emergency management officials said that while the state has been \"lucky\" so far as Tropical Storm Debby travels toward South Carolina, residents should remain cautious as \"we are not nearly out of the woods yet.\"\n\nThe storm is expected to make a second landfall along northern Charleston late Wednesday night or Thursday morning.\n\nMcMaster said so far, no deaths or injuries have been reported from the storm in the state.\n\n\"We are in the second act of a three-act play,\" McMaster said during a press conference Wednesday afternoon. He said the first act was the rain primarily affecting Beaufort and Charleston counties. The second act is expected to have \"heavy rains\" affecting the Midlands and the coast, with the third act occurring after the rain.\n\nMcMaster said the PeeDee area of the state is the next area expected to receive heavy rain.\n\nJohn Quagliariello, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said Tropical Storm Debby has \"strengthened some\" after going offshore and is moving northeast at 3 miles per hour. He said the storm could strengthen some more before it officially makes landfall.\n\nThe state's main concern has always been the potential for flash and river flooding, which remains a chief concern. So far, the state has seen 9 to 17 inches of rain from the tropical storm.\n\nAdditional rainfall of 4 to 8 inches could still occur, hitting the already-drenched ground, which would not be able to absorb the incoming rainfall.\n\nOfficials continued to encourage residents to use \"extreme caution\" when traveling.\n\nAccording to Doug Outlaw with the NWS at GSP, Greenville's total rainfall will be less than an inch.\n\n\"We're not really expecting any problems for Greenville. Areas west of Greenville, there's hardly any rain,\" Outlaw said. \"Clemson, not even a quarter of an inch.\"\n\nThursday's rainstorm is forecast to be heavy due to the tropical nature of the storm, but brief. The chance for thunderstorms is low.\n\nRed Cross, Salvation Army volunteers head to storm-damaged areas\n\nOn Wednesday, the Red Cross of Greenville and the Salvation Army of Spartanburg sent food, clothing, and volunteers to the Lowcountry to help people displaced by Tropical Storm Debby.\n\nFor Red Cross volunteer Cheryl Bashaw, 64, of Anderson, the work helps people in their lowest moments.\n\n\"Every case is always going to be different, different circumstances, different people, different place, different everything but then again, they're all the same,\" said Bashaw who was headed to the Charleston area. \"They've all just experienced possibly a tragic event that may change their life. I find it rewarding to try to help them through that.\"\n\nMandy McMahon, the Red Cross spokesperson, said the organization has at least 770 volunteers deployed up and down the coast from Florida and Georgia to the Carolinas. About 280 people are staying in Red Cross shelters.\n\nTropical Storm Debby rainfall totals for SC, NC, Georgia\n\nTropical Storm Debby continues to wreak havoc on the Southeast coast, dumping more than a foot of rain in some South Carolina locations through Wednesday morning, Aug. 7.\n\n\"Heavy rainfall across portions of the Carolinas is expected to persist through Thursday along with areas of considerable flooding,\" the National Hurricane Center said in an 11 a.m. Aug. 7 statement.\n\nThe Hurricane Center said that tropical storm conditions will continue to impact parts of the North Carolina and South Carolina coasts through Thursday, and also that storm surge is likely to result in coastal flooding in those areas.\n\nTropical Storm Debby hits Hampton County, SC Lowcountry\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, Tropical Storm Debby has fortunately proven to be not quite the historic weather monster that forecasters and Southeastern U.S. residents feared, but the ongoing storm has already left a catastrophic impact on the S.C. Lowcountry and she isn't done yet.\n\nDebby attacked the Florida Panhandle's Big Bend region as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday morning, drenched Florida and Georgia before hugging the southeast coast and making an expected second landfall in South Carolina as a tropical storm.\n\nIn her wake, governors in the three states and U.S. President Joe Biden declared Debby a disaster for millions living and working in the Southeast.\n\nWhile nearby Jasper County appeared to bear the brunt of the storm in the South Carolina Lowcountry, Hampton County is facing its own challenges, with some road sections not just flooded but completely washed away and destroyed, forcing county officials to declare an Aug. 6 Civil Emergency.\n\nTropical Storm Debby turns streets of Charleston to rivers\n\nTropical storm Debby's center is on track to move onto South Carolina's coast by Wednesday night or early Thursday.\n\nThis update comes from the National Hurricane Center's (NHS) 11:10 a.m. public advisory, which states Debby has picked up slightly in strength.\n\nA dangerous flood threat continues for portions of the Carolinas, especially for residents on the coast. By Tuesday morning, Charleston's streets were submerged in water due to heavy rainfall, and emergency officials worked together to bring residents to safety.\n\nBluffton assisting residents due to Tropical Storm Debby flooding\n\nThe Town of Bluffton has seen about 13 inches of rain as of Wednesday afternoon and more was expected within the next 24 hours.\n\n\"The grounds are already saturated, and the community still needs to take precautions,\" a representative for the town said Wednesday.\n\nTown leaders and staff have been traveling throughout Bluffton throughout the storm clearing and cleaning debris off the roads, assisting with ditch debris and speaking to residents.\n\nWhat's the difference between a hurricane and a tropical storm?\n\nSouth Carolina's coast has received record amounts of rainfall in the wake of Tropical Storm Debby, which made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in Steinhatchee, Florida early Monday morning before weakening into a tropical storm again.\n\nBut what makes a hurricane different from a tropical storm?

By the weekend, the storm could also produce rain of up to 4 inches in central New York state and into northern Vermont.\n\nAt least six people have died in Florida and Georgia in the wake of the storm, which made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and headed northeast.\n\nGovernors in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia have declared states of emergency. The storm has already left neighborhoods and communities underwater, washing out streets and inundating homes across the region.\n\nEmergency management officials were keeping a close watch as the rainwater drained into the numerous river systems that snake through the Carolinas.

The deluges have engorged rivers, flooded roadways and trapped people in cars, homes and boats.\n\nEven more chaos is on the horizon as the storm heads toward the Northeast. Here's the latest:\n\n* Debby's current path: After landfall, the storm will finally begin to pick up speed. It is on track to move into North Carolina by Thursday evening and into northern Virginia by Friday morning. Debby is then forecasted to accelerate into Pennsylvania and New Yorkby Friday evening and through New England by early Saturday afternoon, bringing heavy rains and flash flooding to a region drenched by storms earlier this week.\n\n* \"Be prepared for a deluge,\" North Carolina governor says: North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents Wednesday to brace for major rains and flooding. \"All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge,\" Cooper said, describing the incoming threat as \"more rain than most of us see in a month, or even several months.\" Rainfall totals across the state could reach as high as 15 inches and South Carolina could see totals approaching 25 inches. Dangerous rip currents and storm surges of up to 3 feet are possible along the Carolinas' coasts.\n\n* At least 10 tornadoes confirmed: Debby has whipped up at least 10 tornadoes that have been confirmed by the National Weather Service as of early Thursday. That includes four tornadoes in Florida, four in South Carolina and two in North Carolina. The service warned of a tornado in Snow Hill, North Carolina, early Thursday, describing it as \"large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly.\" About 30 miles north, in Wilson County, a tornado scattered roads with debris and damaged multiple buildings, including a middle school and at least 10 homes, officials said. There were no injuries reported, county officials said in a social media post early Thursday.\n\n* Tornado watches issued in North Carolina and Virginia: Tornado watches have been issued for parts of eastern North Carolina and southeastern Virginia. More than 5 million people are impacted, including the cities of Raleigh and Virginia Beach. \"The tornado threat with Debby is expected to gradually expand northward and somewhat westward through midday, while lingering for several more hours,\" the Storm Prediction Center said. Tornado warnings were also in effect across portions of North Carolina early Thursday. Damage has been reported in Wilson, Wade, Nash and Green counties.\n\n* Disaster declarations across the Southeast: President Joe Biden has approved disaster declarations for Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas - all of which have been pummeled by Debby this week. More than 700 Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel have been deployed to the Southeast, and search and rescue teams are on standby to assist as needed, the agency said Wednesday.\n\n* Georgia dam at risk of \"imminent failure\": A dam in Bulloch County, Georgia - about 50 miles northwest of Savannah - is in danger of \"imminent failure\" as a result of Debby's torrential rainfall, the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, said. Parts of the county have already suffered serious flooding, requiring water rescues in a mobile home park. But if the dam breaks, communities immediately downstream are at the greatest risk for more flooding and may be asked to evacuate.\n\n* Triple-digit heat in store for Southeast: Potentially dangerous heat has been hovering over the Southeast in Debby's wake and is expected to persist Thursday and through the weekend as storm recovery continues. While high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s are expected, the heat indices - how the body feels under combined heat and humidity - could exceed 110 degrees. The heat index in Steinhatchee, Florida, near where Debby made its first landfall, could hit 113 degrees on Thursday.\n\nAs Debby has churned through the Southeast, the storm has left behind disastrous scenes. Homes have been shredded by winds and swamped by floodwaters, and roads have been washed out or submerged, creating hazardous conditions for impacted communities.\n\nIn South Carolina's Lowcountry, a home in Bluffton has become an alligator's paradise as floodwaters have turned Adrienne LeBlanc's yard into an inviting swampland.\n\nThough LeBlanc is no stranger to alligators - often seeing them sunbathing in the distance - she was surprised to wake up after heavy rains Wednesday to discover her backyard had been invaded by alligators.\n\n\"It's like National Geographic in our backyard right now,\" LeBlanc told CNN. She counted eight alligators swimming around her house, and saw a few of them wrestling.\n\n\"Jokingly I told my husband, 'When I wake up tomorrow that bad boy is going to be in our bedroom,'\" LeBlanc said.\n\nAfter 17 years of living in Bluffton, LeBlanc said she has experienced this level of flooding once - when Hurricane Matthew made landfall in the state in 2016.\n\nSouth Carolina hasn't seen a named storm make landfall on its shores since Hurricane Ian's arrival in 2022 as a Category 1 storm. The last named storm to track across the state in any fashion was Tropical Storm Idalia in August 2023.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nCNN's Andy Rose, Sharif Paget, Mary Gilbert and Kara Mihm contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Here's the top concern", "body": "Disney fans were undeterred by Tropical Storm Debby and a tornado watchas they headed to Walt Disney World despite the bad weather.\n\nHeavy rain from the remnants of Tropical Storm Debby are expected in New York state this week, which could cause potential flash floods and flooding.\n\nTropical Storm Debby impacts on New York\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service in Buffalo, Debby's remnants will fuel \"very heavy rainfall\" over central and eastern New York (including parts of the Finger Lakes region) Friday into Friday night. In the Rochester region and upstate New York, anywhere from 2 to 4 inches of rainfall are predicted, with localized amounts possible in the 6-inch range.\n\nThis could cause some flash flooding or river flooding risks, forecasters said.\n\nFlood watch issued in upstate NY\n\nParts of Ontario, Wayne and Cayuga counties are under a flood watch - as are other parts of the Empire State - from Friday morning through Saturday morning, due to the predicted excessive rainfall, according to the Weather Service.\n\nDebby is expected to combine with another weather system over the Mid-Atlantic on Friday, gaining speed as it pushes to the northeast, forecasters said. The storm could dump as much as 25 inches of rain in South Carolina and 15 inches in southeastern North Carolina through Friday.\n\nWeather Service Meteorologist Phillip Pandolfo said that the situation has been complicated to predict as the remnants of Tropical Storm Debby move north and a cold front is predicted to move into the Rochester region and the two systems will likely interact over our area.\n\n\"The exact path of Debby is uncertain currently, but is tracking eastward,\" he said. As of Thursday morning, it appears that parts of Ontario and Wayne counties are the greatest a risk for heavy rainfall - between 2 to 4 inches or even more - on Friday.\n\nPandolfo also predicted a \"sharp gradient\" and \"highly variable\" amount of rain, meaning that one spot may see several inches while nearby, the amount of rainfall could be much less.\n\nThe Rochester metro area could see around an inch of rain in the same timeframe, Pandolfo said, noting that the storm tracking could change.\n\n\"Keep a close eye on Debby\" as the storm approaches, he said. Additional weather alerts are likely as the storm moves north.\n\nDebby blamed for at least six deaths\n\nDebby moved along the central coast of South Carolina on Wednesday, drenching parts of Florida and Georgia in over a foot of rain and causing severe flooding through the Mid-Atlantic region.\n\nOfficials ordered evacuations due to widespread flash flooding as the system overtopped drainage systems and several Georgia dams. The storm has killed at least six people, including a boater in Gulfport, Florida, police confirmed Tuesday, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nInitially formed in the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday, the system made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane by Monday morning. Steinhatchee, a small town in Taylor County, faced maximum sustained winds of 80 mph, causing at least four deaths.\n\nDebby made its way through northern Florida for hours until wind speeds slowed to 65 mph and officials downgraded it to a tropical storm status on Monday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. By Tuesday, it pushed off the coast of Georgia and moved along the central coast of South Carolina on Wednesday night or early Thursday morning.", "source": {"uri": "democratandchronicle.com",

The storm is set to unleash more torrential rains, tornadoes and destructive flooding as it marches northward through the rest of the week, inundating several already-soaked states.\n\nAs of 11 p.m. ET Wednesday, Debby's center was 25 miles east-northeast of Charleston and inching forward at just 3 mph, a typical walking speed for many people, the National Hurricane Center said.\n\nSince crashing into Florida as a Category 1 hurricane on Monday, Debby has dumped more than a foot of rain over parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The deluges have engorged rivers, flooded roadways and trapped people in cars, homes and boats.\n\nBut even more chaos is on the horizon as the storm heads toward the Northeast. Here's the latest:\n\n* Debby's current path: After landfall, the storm will finally begin to pick up speed. It is on track to move into North Carolina by Thursday evening and into northern Virginia by Friday morning. Debby is then forecasted to accelerate through Pennsylvania by Friday evening and through New England by Saturday morning, bringing heavy rains and flash flooding to a region drenched by storms earlier this week.\n\n* \"Be prepared for a deluge,\" North Carolina governor says: North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned residents on Wednesday to brace for major rains and flooding. \"All North Carolinians across our state need to be prepared for a deluge,\" Cooper said, describing the incoming threat as \"more rain than most of us see in a month, or even several months.\" A tornado watch has been issued for eastern North Carolina until 8 a.m. Thursday. Rainfall totals across the state could reach as high as 15 inches and South Carolina could see totals approaching 25 inches. Dangerous rip currents and storm surges of up to 3 feet are possible along the Carolinas' coasts.\n\n* Disaster declarations across the Southeast: President Joe Biden has approved disaster declarations for Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas - all of which have been pummeled by Debby this week. More than 700 Federal Emergency Management Agency personnel have been deployed to the Southeast, and search and rescue teams are on standby to assist as needed, the agency said Wednesday.\n\n* Georgia dam at risk of \"imminent failure\": A dam in Bulloch County, Georgia - about 50 miles northwest of Savannah - is in danger of \"imminent failure\" as a result of Debby's torrential rainfall, the National Weather Service in Charleston, South Carolina, said. Parts of the county have already suffered serious flooding, requiring water rescues in a mobile home park. But if the dam breaks, communities immediately downstream are at the greatest risk for more flooding and may be asked to evacuate.\n\n* Triple-digit heat in store for Southeast: Potentially dangerous heat has been hovering over the Southeast in Debby's wake and is expected to persist Thursday and through the weekend as storm recovery continues. While high temperatures in the upper 80s and lower 90s are expected, the heat indices - how the body feels under combined heat and humidity - could exceed 110 degrees. The heat index in Steinhatchee, Florida, near where Debby made its first landfall, could hit 113 degrees on Thursday.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nCNN's Andy Rose, Mary Gilbert and Kara Mihm contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The storm had already triggered tornadoes and caused streets to be submerged in floodwaters, with forecasts predicting even more rain for the Southern states.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center cautioned that some locations could experience up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain from the storm, while the National Weather Service verified the occurrence of four tornadoes near Charleston, as reported by AP.\n\nIn Huger, South Carolina, approximately 15 miles (24 kilometers) northeast of Charleston, resident Gene Taylor awaited the recession of floodwaters from French Quarter Creek following high tide.

The storm's moisture intensified another weather system, resulting in severe thunderstorms. Some areas in New Jersey received up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain within a four-hour period. In New York City, authorities warned of potential flash flooding and employed drones equipped with loudspeakers to alert residents in basement apartments to prepare for rapid evacuation.

(AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby spawned damaging tornadoes that killed one person, flooded a town and temporarily shut down part of Interstate 95 early Thursday as it blew into North Carolina after making a second landfall overnight.\n\nThe storm was expected to churn up the East Coast, where residents as far north as Vermont could get several inches of flooding rain this weekend.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says Debby came ashore early Thursday near Bulls Bay, South Carolina. Debby first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday on the Gulf Coast of Florida. It was still a tropical storm Thursday morning, with maximum sustained winds at 50 mph (80 kph).\n\nPeople are also reading...

At least three tornadoes were reported overnight in North Carolina, including one around 3 a.m. that damaged at least four houses, a church and a school in Wilson County east of Raleigh, county officials said.\n\nOne person died in a home damaged by the tornado in Lucama, North Carolina, Wilson County spokesman Stephen Mann said in an email. No further details on the person were immediately provided.\n\nTheresa Richardson hunkered down with her husband and granddaughter in the closet of their Lucama home as the tornado tore through about a mile away.\n\nDebris struck the house. And they could hear the roof of nearby Springfield Middle School being ripped off. The home of one of her granddaughter's friends was destroyed from the tornado.\n\nRichardson said this wasn't the first time the area was struck by a tornado -- her neighbors call the road they live on \"Tornado Alley.\"\n\nThe superintendent of Wilson County Schools confirmed damage at Springfield Middle School, where sections of the walls and roof of the 6th and 7th grade halls are gone or compromised.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking to see the school right after the event,\" Superintendent Lane Mills said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, about 100 miles (161 kilometers) south of Lucama, deputies in Bladenboro had posted photos of a patrol car damaged by a tree as well as roads that had been washed out. Standing water a few feet deep covered parts of the tiny North Carolina town.\n\nIn Huger, northeast of Charleston, South Carolina, Gene Taylor waited for the water to drain from his house along French Quarter Creek as high tide passed. He had learned the hard way to begin moving his belongings up or out of his home last week as Debby approached. Taylor figures this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"We got caught with our pants down in 2015. We waited, didn't think the water was going to come up as quick. But it did, and it caught us. We couldn't even get the vehicles out,\" Taylor said.\n\nAt least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Georgia's Bulloch County, but no deaths had been reported, authorities said. More than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nThe neighbors on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, took Debby's drenching with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumped rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to weather service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours, and New York City officials warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nAbout 270,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Thursday morning, according to PowerOutage.us, following severe storms including two confirmed tornadoes.\n\nAll that water has to drain out to sea. South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as they flow to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least seven people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nThis story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to total rainfall amounts for the Carolinas.\n\nAssociated Press contributors include Jeffrey Collins in Columbia, South Carolina, Russ Bynum in Pooler, Georgia; Bruce Shipkowski in Toms River, New Jersey; Jeff Martin in Atlanta, and Lisa Baumann in Bellingham, Washington.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

additional one to three inches and three to six inches of rainfall expected respectively.\n\nThis would bring maximum storm rainfall totals to between 15 and 25 inches in places.\n\nAreas near the

shoreline.\"\n\nIn addition, the NHC has warned that \"a few tornadoes may occur over part of eastern North Carolina this morning\", with the threat shifting northward later today into central North Carolina and southern to central Virginia.\n\nWilson County Government officials confirmed that an \"active tornado\" touched down at around 3am in Lucama, North Carolina this morning.\n\nSerious

What to expect", "body": "Saildrone and NOAA have deployed a fleet of unmanned surface vehicles into hurricanes to better understand how these storms are formed.\n\nWith Tropical Storm Debby veering to the west, the weekend forecast in Rhode Island is looking much better than it previously did.\n\n\"We will get a few showers but nothing like originally anticipated,\" meteorologist Joe Dellicarpini of the National Weather Service in Norton said. \"We're not looking at anything tremendous.\"\n\nThe latest rainfall predictions maps from the National Hurricane Center show Rhode Island getting less than an inch.\n\nDebby is currently in the Carolinas. The storm made its second U.S. landfall around 2 a.m. near Bulls Bay, South Carolina, just northeast of Charleston, with maximum sustained winds up to 50 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. It's expected to drop 4 to 8 inches of rain today.\n\nPrevious forecasts from the National Hurricane Center predicted Debby, which first made landfall in Florida as a Category 1 hurricane, would bring heavy rain to the region, though forecasters did caution their was a high degree of uncertainty. Now the picture is looking clearer.\n\nHere's what to know about the forecast in New England.\n\nWhen will Debby arrive in Rhode Island?\n\nDellicarpini said bulk of the rain will arrive Friday night and will last into Saturday morning in Southern New England. The current track for the storm has the center of the tropical storm arriving in Vermont at 2 a.m. on Saturday.\n\nAfter the rain ends Saturday, the weather is forecasted to be very nice, with sunshine and cool weather in Southern New England, according to Dellicarpini.\n\nThe AccuWeather forecast noted there is still a danger of flooding in some areas.\n\n\"We are very concerned about the flooding threat extending all the way up into New England, especially after we've seen flooding rainfall across parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and southern New York yesterday,\" AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva stated in a release. \"The ground is incredibly saturated right now. It will take only about 1.5 to 2.5 inches of additional rainfall from Debby in some of the areas to cause flash flooding.\"\n\nThe bulk of the rain is expected to fall in Northern New England, with Vermont seeing the most rain. Vermont may see 2 to 4 inches of rain, with local amounts up to 6 inches that could cause more flash flooding in the region.\n\n\"For the remainder of Northern New England, 1 to 3 inches, with local amounts to 4 inches, are expected into Saturday,\" the National Hurricane Center said. \"Scattered instances of flash flooding are possible.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby tracker\n\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nTropical Storm Debby spaghetti models\n\nIllustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest-performing models to help make its forecasts.\n\nHow long does hurricane season last?\n\nThe season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30 in

It's a lesson learned the hard way -- Taylor estimated that this is the fourth time he has had floodwater in his home in the past nine years.\n\n\"To save everything, we've learned from the past it's better be prepared for the worst. And unfortunately, I think we got it,\" Taylor said.\n\nA few doors down, Charles Grainger was cleaning up after about 8 inches (20 centimeters) of water got into his home.\n\n\"Eight inches disrupts your whole life,\" Grainger said. \"You don't get used to it. You just grin and bear it. It's part of living on the creek.\"\n\nThe National Hurricane Center warned that isolated areas could see up to 25 inches (64 centimeters) of rain from Debby.\n\nIn Georgia, at least four dams were breached northwest of Savannah in Bulloch County, but no fatalities have been reported so far, authorities said at a briefing.\n\nMore than 75 people were rescued from floodwaters in the county, said Corey Kemp, director of emergency management, and about 100 roads were closed.\n\n\"We've been faced with a lot of things we've never been faced with before,\" Bulloch County Commission Chairman Roy Thompson said. \"I'm 78-plus years old and have never seen anything like this before in Bulloch County. It's amazing what has happened, and amazing what is going to continue to happen until all these waters get out of here.\"\n\nFor residents on Tappan Zee Drive in suburban Pooler, west of Savannah, Georgia, the drenching that Debby delivered came with a painful dose of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew overflowed a nearby canal and flooded several of the same homes.\n\nLocated roughly 30 miles (50 kilometers) inland from the Atlantic Ocean, with no creeks or rivers nearby, the neighborhood doesn't seem like a high-risk location for tropical flooding. But residents say drainage problems have plagued their street for well over a decade, despite local government efforts to fix them.\n\nDebby also dumpred rain on communities all the way up to the Great Lakes and New York and New Jersey. Moisture from the tropical storm strengthened another system Tuesday evening, which caused strong thunderstorms, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Kleebauer.\n\n\"We had a multi-round period of showers and thunderstorms that kind of scooted from Michigan eastward,\" Kleebauer said.\n\nAs much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain fell in parts of New Jersey in less than four hours.\n\nEmergency officials in New York City warned of potential flash flooding, flying drones with loudspeakers in some neighborhoods to tell people in basement apartments to be ready to flee at a moment's notice. Multiple water rescues were reported in and near the city.\n\nNearly 330,000 customers remained without power in Ohio as of Wednesday afternoon following severe storms there, according to PowerOutage.us. Utility officials with FirstEnergy's Illuminating Company said via social media that power restoration would take days due to the damage.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said his state was just entering Act 2 of a three-act play, after more than 60 homes were damaged but roads and water systems were without significant problems.\n\n\"We've been lucky so far. Things have not been as bad as they could have been,\" McMaster said.\n\nAct 2 was to arrive overnight into Thursday when Debby moves back onshore and heavy rain returns, this time to the northern part of the coast and inland. An additional 4 to 8 inches (10 to 20 centimeters) of rain could fall, said John Quagliariello, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Columbia.\n\n\"It may not be as catastrophic as what we were saying, but we still think as these rain bands develop they could sit over the same area for long periods of time, produce a lot of rainfall and a lot of flooding,\" Quagliariello said.\n\nThe final act may come next week if enough rain falls upstream in North Carolina to cause major flooding along rivers as it flows to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe center of Debby was over the Atlantic on Wednesday evening, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) east-southeast of Charleston, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane early Monday along Florida's Gulf Coast.\n\nA state of emergency was in effect for both North Carolina and Virginia. Maryland issued a state of preparedness declaration that coordinates preparations without declaring an emergency.\n\nAt least six people have died due to the storm, five of them in traffic accidents or from fallen trees. The sixth death involved a 48-year-old man in Gulfport, Florida, whose body was recovered after his anchored sailboat partially sank.\n\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, the Brown Dog Deli closed early Monday and couldn't open Tuesday due to a curfew decreed by local officials. On Wednesday the lunch crowd poured in after days of storm preparations and hunkering down. The first words from the person answering the phone were: \"Yes, we're open.\"\n\n\"We've got a lot of locals walking in after being cooped up for two days looking for a good meal,\" kitchen manager Liz Denney said.\n\nSome water got around the sandbags that employees placed Monday, but the restaurant has had worse flooding other times in the past year, Denney said. The standing water and the occasional interruption, she added, is just part of living on the coast.\n\n\"It comes with the territory,\" Denney said.", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com",

This may cause flooding or runoff east of I-77. Rainfall amounts may rapidly increase east of Gaffney going toward Charlotte, North Carolina. The Asheville, North Carolina, area is projected to receive only a half an inch of rain.\n\nWhen will Debby move out of the Upstate area?\n\nDebby was initially forecast to move out of the Upstate around Saturday morning. Now, it is expected to clear out of the area even sooner.\n\nAccording to Outlaw, the storm should leave the area somewhere between Thursday morning and Thursday afternoon.

But what does that mean for NYC?\n\n***Click each headline to jump to the designated topic.\n\nThrough Sunday, parts of New York state could see an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain, as what's left of Debby races through the Tri-State area.\n\nNew York City has been placed in a Level 2 flood threat by NOAA's Weather Prediction Center (WPC).\n\nWhat should the Big Apple really expect though these next few days? FOX 5 NY's Nick Gregory breaks down the 'best' and 'worst' case scenarios for the region.\n\nWhile Debby has been crawling along the South Carolina coast today, eventually it will be turning northward, begin to accelerate, and also weaken into a Tropical Depression. The storm will have an effect on the Tri-State area, but the question remains how much rain will occur.\n\n\"At the moment, the best case scenario is a track to our west which most computer models are suggesting. This would bring the core of the heaviest rain across eastern Pennsylvania up into upstate New York and northern New England,\" FOX 5 NY's Nick Gregory said.\n\nThat could still result in showers and thunderstorms for our area and, because of the tropical nature of the moisture, we could still end up with some locally heavy rainfall of 1 to 3 inches.\n\nThe higher amounts of 4 to 6+ inches would be over eastern Pennsylvania and to the north.\n\nThe worst case scenario would be that the track shifts further east, bringing the core of the storm closer or directly over the Tri-State area, which would then in turn bring with it those 4 to 6 inch rainfall totals.\n\nThat could then result in the threat of flash flooding.\n\nThe FOX Forecast Center said that on Friday, Debby, which will be quickly transitioning from a tropical storm to a post-tropical storm will begin to push through interior portions of the Northeast.\n\n\"Heavy tropical rain related to Debby will be in the area in a couple of days,\" Woods said in a post on X, formally Twitter.\n\nThe extreme amounts of tropical moisture still being produced by the storm, combined with a dip in the jet stream off to the west, are expected to produce heavy precipitation throughout the interior Northeast.", "source": {"uri": "fox5ny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 New York"}, "authors": [{"uri":

A sustained wind of 36 mph (57 km/h) and\n\na gust to 39 mph (63 km/h) was recently reported at Cape Lookout,\n\nNorth Carolina.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure based on surface\n\nobservations is 995 mb (29.38 inches).\n\nHAZARDS AFFECTING LAND\n\n----------------------\n\nKey messages for Debby can be found in the Tropical Cyclone\n\nDiscussion under AWIPS header MIATCDAT4 and WMO header WTNT44 KNHC.\n\nWIND: Tropical storm conditions are expected to continue along the\n\ncoasts of South Carolina and North Carolina within the tropical\n\nstorm warning area for much of the day.\n\nSTORM SURGE: The combination of storm surge and tide will cause\n\nnormally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters\n\nmoving inland from the shoreline. The water could reach the\n\nfollowing heights above ground somewhere in the indicated areas if\n\nthe peak surge occurs at the time of high tide...\n\nSouth Santee River to Ocracoke Inlet including the Neuse and\n\nPamlico Rivers...1 to 3 ft\n\nFor a complete depiction of areas at risk of storm surge inundation,\n\nplease see the National Weather Service Peak Storm Surge Graphic,\n\navailable at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?peakSurge.\n\nRAINFALL: Debby is expected to produce an additional 3 to 6 inches\n\nof rainfall with locally higher amounts, across portions of\n\nsoutheastern North Carolina leading to maximum storm total amounts\n\nas high as 15 inches. Additional rainfall of 1 to 3 inches over\n\nportions of eastern South Carolina will bring maximum storm total\n\namounts as high as 20 to 25 inches. Considerable flooding is\n\nexpected across portions of eastern South Carolina and southeast\n\nNorth Carolina through Friday.\n\nFrom central North Carolina northward across portions of Virginia, 3\n\nto 7 inches with local amounts to 10 inches, are expected through\n\nFriday. This rainfall will likely result in areas of considerable\n\nflash and urban flooding, with river flooding possible.\n\nFrom portions of Maryland north through Upstate New York and\n\nVermont, 2 to 4 inches, with local amounts to 6 inches, are expected\n\nthrough Friday night. This will likely result in areas of\n\nconsiderable flash and urban flooding as well as river flooding.\n\nFor a complete depiction of forecast rainfall and flash flooding\n\nassociated with Debby, please see the National Weather Service\n\nStorm Total Rainfall Graphic, available at\n\nhurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?rainqpf and the Flash Flood Risk\n\ngraphic at hurricanes.gov/graphics_at4.shtml?ero. For a list of\n\nrainfall observations (and wind reports) associated this storm, see\n\nthe companion storm summary at WBCSCCNS4 with the WMO header ACUS44\n\nKWBC or at the following link:\n\nwww.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html.\n\nTORNADOES: A few tornadoes may occur over parts of eastern North\n\nCarolina this morning. The tornado threat will shift northward\n\nlater today into central North Carolina and southern to central\n\nVirginia.\n\nSURF: Large swells will continue to affect the Southeast U.S.\n\ncoast for another day or two. These conditions are likely to\n\ncause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please\n\nconsult products from your local weather office.\n\nNEXT ADVISORY\n\n-------------\n\nNext complete advisory at 1100 AM EDT.\n\n$$\n\nForecaster

(WCSC/AP) - Tropical Storm Debby made landfall near Bulls Bay in Charleston County early Thursday morning.\n\nClick here to download the free Live 5 First Alert Weather app.\n\nLive 5 Chief Meteorologist Bill Walsh says areas can expect another 4-8 inches of rain through Friday.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, Beaufort reported 12.74 inches of rain, and an area of Hilton Head Island reported 9.61 inches. Hanahan reported 10.17 inches of rain, and Charleston has seen 10.34 inches.\n\nGreen Pond has reported 14.02 inches of rain since Monday morning. Edisto Beach has seen 12.42 inches as of Tuesday morning. More than 11 inches of rain has fallen in Charleston and Summerville recorded more than 9 inches of rain.\n\nThe heavy rain has put French Quarter Creek in Huger at the major flood stage, the National Weather Service said. Homes located along the creek could get inundated with 1-2 feet of water.\n\nOfficials warned that the Edisto River was predicted to reach major flood stage by Sunday morning at around 15 feet. Authorities in Colleton, Dorchester and Charleston counties went door-to-door Wednesday warning residents along the river to prepare for flooding.\n\nThe Live 5 Weather team has declared First Alert Weather Days from Monday through Thursday.\n\nInland areas could see between five to 10 inches of rain, but coastal communities could see as many as 20 inches or more, which is expected to cause flooding. The system will likely stall out over the Lowcountry, which could prolong these issues.\n\nThis rainfall could result in areas of flash and urban flooding, with isolated river flooding possible.\n\nTropical Storm Debby made landfall at around 2 a.m. near Bulls Bay in Charleston.\n\nAt 5 a.m., the center of the storm was located on the coast near latitude 33.2 north, longitude 79.7 west, about 30 miles north-northeast of Charleston.\n\nDebby is moving toward the northwest near 5 mph. This general motion is expected to continue through Thursday morning. A faster motion toward the north and north-northeast across the Carolinas and the U.S. Mid-Atlantic states is expected later Thursday and on Friday.\n\nAir Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft data indicate that maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 50 mph with higher gusts. Additional weakening is forecast Thursday as the center moves farther inland.\n\nDebby is expected to merge with a frontal boundary over the U.S. Mid-Atlantic states on Friday or Friday night.\n\nTropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 185 miles mainly to the east of the center.\n\nThe estimated minimum central pressure based on surface observations is 994 mb or 29.36

The ground is incredibly saturated right now,\" said AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva. \"It will take only about 1.5 to 2.5 inches of additional rainfall from Debby in some of the areas to cause flash flooding. We're forecasting a widespread area of 2-4 inches and a band of 4-8 inches of rainfall.\"\n\nDebby, predicted to make a second landfall late Wednesday night north of Charleston, poses a significant risk of life-threatening and potentially historic flooding in the Southeast. Rainfall totals could reach 18-24 inches along the South Carolina coast, with widespread amounts of 4-8 inches across the region.\n\n\"Debby continues to meander off the South Carolina coast right now. The storm is starting to make a northwest turn and will move toward the South Carolina coast to make landfall somewhere north of Charleston late Wednesday night,\" explained DaSilva. \"The rainbands are expected to fill in before Debby makes its second landfall. Debby could try to intensify a bit over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream this afternoon, but we do not expect rapid intensification at this time.\"\n\nAs Debby accelerates northeastward, a major flooding threat is anticipated in the Northeast between Thursday and Friday. A zone from Virginia through Pennsylvania and into upstate New York and Vermont could see 4-8 inches of rain, with localized amounts up to 12 inches.\n\nDebby's impact is not limited to flooding. Strong winds, tornadoes, power outages, and major travel disruptions are also expected. AccuWeather forecasts thousands of flight cancellations over the coming days.\n\nAccuWeather experts stress the importance of preparedness. Residents and businesses in the storm's path are urged to prepare for potential flooding, power outages, and travel disruptions. Those in flood-prone areas should have evacuation plans in place.\n\nDebby has already caused at least six deaths since making landfall in Florida and is expected to cause tens of billions of dollars in damage across the United States. It is poised to join the ranks of hurricanes like Matthew and Florence, which unleashed catastrophic flooding in the Carolinas.\n\nPlease make a small donation to the Internewscast Journal to help sustain independent journalism.

The alert, which went out a little after 5 a.m., said the region had already received about 1 to 2 inches of rain.\n\nDuke Energy has reported there were more than 18,000 customers without power.\n\nBands of rain could pummel Charlotte all day Thursday into Friday morning, National Weather Service meteorologists said.\n\n\"The combination of persistent gusty winds and wet soils from heavy rainfall will lead to scattered trees & power lines down, with the greatest risk along & east of I-77,\" NWS forecasters said on X, the former Twitter, at 6:30 p.m. Wednesday.\n\nRunoff from Debby could flood streets, rivers and creeks, NWS forecasters warned in a flood watch.\n\nDriving could be treacherous, emergency officials said. \"Stay home if you can,\" Gastonia Police urged Wednesday night.\n\nPredicted NWS rainfall totals bounced around this week, finally settling on 4 to 6 inches for the Charlotte area through Friday. Some areas could see 6 to 8 inches, according to the NWS office in Greer, South Carolina.\n\nLake Norman, Concord, Monroe and Rock Hill, South Carolina, can expect amounts similar to Charlotte, while Gastonia, Lincolnton and other communities west of Charlotte could see smaller totals, according to NWS maps.\n\nDebby's outer rain bands were expected to arrive in Monroe about 8 p.m. Wednesday and midnight in Charlotte, NWS meteorologist Doug Outlaw said.\n\nWeather models as of Wednesday showed these amounts of rain falling across the region through Friday: 4.5 inches in Charlotte, 5 1/4 inches in Concord, 4.9 inches in Statesville, 4.6 inches in Lincolnton, 6.5 inches in Salisbury and 4.3 inches in Rock Hill, Outlaw said.\n\nUnion County is in a state of emergency.\n\nMonroe spokesperson Bradley Lucore said several city facilities, like the Monroe Science Center and Sutton Park Community Center, as well as all parks, lakes and recreation summer camps and programming, are canceled.\n\nLt. Catherine Hower said rain started falling at 1:30 a.m. in Monroe and continued coming down harder throughout the night because of the wind. There were no signs of flooding and all drains appeared to be working properly.\n\n\"The wind was blowing at approximately 21-25 MPH, making the rain come down in sheets blowing across the road. This made visibility difficult at times, especially to see the lines on the road,\" Hower said.\n\nWater is pooling on the side of roads, and in the tire indentations of Highway 75 and Pageland Highway, she said, which increases the possibility of hydroplaning. And some limbs and debris had to be moved out of the roadways.\n\nThe NWS on Tuesday issued a flood watch from late Wednesday through Friday for Mecklenburg, Cabarrus, Iredell, Union and Rowan counties and the South Carolina counties of York and Chester.\n\nThe latest expected rainfall totals could produce \"numerous instances of flash flooding, with significant flooding possible,\" according to the flood watch alert.\n\nTracking the storm\n\nSome voluntary evacuations were underway in Eastern North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said during an 11 a.m. news conference in Raleigh on Wednesday.\n\n\"We expect this storm to continue its slow, gradual approach, bringing multiple days of heavy rainfall and the potential for widespread and severe flash flooding,\" Cooper said. \"Have an emergency plan for your household.\"\n\nCharlotte Fire's swift water rescue team was deployed to Elizabethtown in Bladen County on Wednesday morning to lend assistance. The Harrisburg Fire Department also deployed crews to Bladen County, while North Carolina Emergency Management activated Mooresville Fire-Rescue's 11-member swiftwater rescue team to Harnett County.\n\nAt 8 p.m. Wednesday, the center of Debby was just off the South Carolina coast, about 40 miles southeast of Charleston, according to the National Hurricane Center.\n\nDebby trudged along at 3 mph. Winds increased to 60 mph from 45 mph in the morning, center officials said.\n\nBy Wednesday night, the Charleston NWS office confirmed four Debby-spawned tornadoes: EF1s on Edisto Beach and in Moncks Corner; and EF0s on Kiawah Island and Lady's Island.\n\nThose are the weakest of six tornado classifications on the NWS Enhanced Fujita Scale based on wind speed and damage.\n\nThe storm could weaken on Thursday after the eye moves inland, officials said.\n\nDebby is expected to move faster north and northeast across the Carolinas and the Mid-Atlantic on Thursday and Friday, officials said.\n\nSome outer bands of rain from Debby were reported in southern Union County on Tuesday, before the center of the storm moved off shore in South Carolina, Outlaw said. Bursts of rain popped up near uptown Charlotte.\n\nIt was impossible to say how quickly the rain would fall, NWS meteorologist Steve Wilkinson told The Charlotte Observer on Tuesday.\n\nThat's because Debby is \"very slow moving\" and not traveling in a straight line, he said.\n\nIf the rains spread out over time, flooding threats lessen, he said.\n\nForecasters also don't know when the worst of the deluge will descend on Charlotte.\n\nRains are expected all day Thursday, Thursday night and into Friday, Wilkinson said.\n\nThrough Saturday morning, the storm could dump 10 to 20 inches of rain on southeast Georgia, South Carolina's coastal plain and southeast North Carolina, The News & Observer reported. Some areas could see up to 30 inches.\n\nCharlotte Douglas International Airport saw a big drop in canceled and delayed flights from Debby on Tuesday and Wednesday, compared with Monday.\n\nOn Wednesday, there were 479 flights delayed and 36 were canceled at CLT, according to FlightAware, an online website providing real-time information. That's a combined 515 flight disruptions.\n\nEarly Thursday also started with a spate of problems, including 34 delays and nine cancellations by 7 a.m.\n\nTo prevent flooding on Charlotte streets, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services urged residents to check storm drains near their homes and clear any blockages. Mecklenburg County offices will be closed for in-person services Thursday.\n\nWhere could Charlotte flood?\n\nParts of the Charlotte area closest to creeks and rivers are the most likely to flood. That includes roads that cross over Briar Creek or Little Sugar Creek.\n\nMecklenburg County residents can use Storm Water Services' interactive map to see the exact flood risk for their home or business.\n\nTo use the map, visit maps.mecklenburgcountync.gov/3dfz and enter the address in question. The program will then detail whether the property is in a floodplain, its risk level for flooding and tips for reducing the risk of flooding.\n\nSpeedway campgrounds open to evacuees\n\nAt noon Wednesday, Charlotte Motor Speedway in Concord opened its campgrounds to coastal and other evacuees.\n\nCampers should check in at the Camping World Racing Resort office, 6600 Bruton Smith Blvd., which can be accessed at the entrance to zMAX Dragway.\n\nAfter-hours arrivals should park near the camping office and check in during regular business hours. Evacuees will have access to speedway bathhouses.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_marusak@charlotteobserver.com", "name": "Joe Marusak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jeff_a_chamer@charlotteobserver.com", "name": "Jeff A.

It's reminiscent of other catastrophic tropical cyclones that have battered the United States over the past eight years.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the storm was drifting at 5 mph near the South Carolina coast, about the pace of a monarch butterfly. It is expected to pick up speed today as it heads through North Carolina, where a foot or more of rain could fall in the southeastern part of the state and 6 to 8 inches are anticipated in the central Piedmont.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency this week, warning residents on Wednesday to \"be prepared for a deluge.\"\n\nA warmer atmosphere holds more water; likewise, warmer temperatures accelerate evaporation. \"There's a lot of water in this system that's just ready to come out,\" North Carolina's state climatologist, Kathie Dello, said. \"We're pulling more of that moisture into the air and essentially supercharging the atmosphere. Or, as I like to say, get a cup of coffee and pour in a few shots of espresso.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby has arrived in what is on track to be one of the top 10 warmest years on record in North Carolina. As recently as late June, 99 of the state's 100 counties were experiencing drought conditions ranging from abnormally dry to severe, according to the State Climate Office.\n\nThat pattern reversed in July, when several cities reported their wettest July on record.\n\n\"Swings between wet and dry are something that we're expecting with climate change,\" Dello said. \"The extremes become more extreme.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby is reminiscent of two historic hurricanes that hit North Carolina -- Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018. Although both were Category 1 storms, they caused disproportionate damage because they stalled over land and dumped historic amounts of rain -- as much as 3 feet -- in eastern North Carolina. Thousands of people were left homeless and damages totaled in the billions of dollars.\n\nTropical storms and hurricanes are producing heavier rain over the U.S., an indicator of climate change, according to a study published last month in the Journal of Climate, a publication of the American Meteorological Society.\n\nJohn Uehling co-authored the paper with Carl Schreck III, both of whom are scientists at the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies.\n\nUehling told Inside Climate News that Tropical Storm Debby is \"a classic case of what we've seen a lot in recent years,\" including with Hurricanes Harvey and Florence, \"where we have a stalling storm near the coastline that basically dumps rain over the same areas for an extended and prolonged period of time.\"\n\nUsing historical rainfall gauge data, Uehling and Schreck found that instances of heavy rain associated with tropical cyclones are becoming more frequent and extreme. Major hurricanes -- those in categories 3 through 5 -- show the largest increases in extreme rainfall.\n\n\"The real impact that we're seeing is where the worst events are getting significantly worse,\" Uehling said, whereas, in general \"your more run-of-the-mill events are not increasing at nearly the same rate.\"\n\nThe study's findings could help local governments, planners and residents prepare for these weather disasters to occur more frequently, Uehling said.\n\nThat includes inland areas in particular, where the study found the highest increases in rainfall: Alabama and Mississippi through southern Appalachia, including the mountains of North Carolina. Flooding in higher elevations presents different threats -- including mudslides and more challenging evacuations -- than coastal areas.\n\n\"Places that have not been used to dealing with these kinds of threats are going to have to start dealing with them more often,\" Uehling said.\n\n\"It's important that people keep in mind that our climate is changing, that these sort of events are occurring with more and more frequency, and that the impacts seem to be getting greater,\" he said. \"We have a duty as a society not only to mitigate against these changes, but to do what we can to prevent them from getting worse.\"\n\nDebby made landfall Monday morning near Steinhatchee, Fla., in the state's sparsely populated Big Bend region, so named for the way the peninsula meets the Panhandle. The category 1 storm forged a path similar to that of last year's Idalia, a category 3 hurricane that was the strongest to strike this part of the state since 1896.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Floridians lost power and Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 61 of the state's 67 counties. More than 9,400 feet of what his administration characterized as flood protection devices were deployed at critical infrastructure sites such as schools, health care facilities and roads and bridges. For the first time flood control barriers also were positioned around utility substations, to try to prevent more power outages, his administration said.\n\nFlorida officials feared more flooding later in the week, as water continued to flow south from the rain-soaked states of Georgia and the Carolinas. By Wednesday, the Florida Division of Emergency Management had pumped more than 104 million gallons of floodwater from communities across the state, the DeSantis administration said.\n\n\"This could take anywhere from three to seven days,\" said Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, of the duration of the flooding in the state. \"This is going to be about a weeklong event that we're going to be monitoring.\"\n\nSome of the worst flooding occurred about 200 miles from the Big Bend region in Sarasota, a beachy community south of Tampa. As much as 12 to 18 inches of rain pummeled the community as Debby's outer bands swirled some 80 miles offshore. The totals constituted some of the highest rainfall amounts in the state, said Tony Hurt, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Ruskin, outside of Tampa. Florida typically receives roughly 50 inches of rain annually.\n\nAt least 500 Sarasota residents were rescued from flooded houses, according to the police department. To the north, in neighboring Manatee County, 186 residents were rescued, the local government said. Officials characterized the rainfall as record-breaking.\n\n\"Any kind of event like this you just try to be as prepared and stay as flexible as you can,\" said Terry Chapman, minister at the South Trail Church of Christ in Sarasota. \"We are thankful that it was not worse.\"\n\nSome of the church's parishioners had friends and family members who were affected by the flooding, and the congregation was considering the best ways to offer help. One area that was especially hard-hit was east of Interstate 75, well away from the Gulf Coast.\n\n\"Those are newer houses,\" Chapman said. \"Those are houses that were built within the last 20 years.\"\n\nWarm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico powered a rapid intensification of Debby, a phenomenon that is becoming more common because of climate change. The warming climate also is leading to more water evaporation, producing more water vapor that can feed heavy downpours like those experienced with Debby, said Marshall Shepherd, director of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the University of Georgia.\n\n\"For Floridians, the intensity of the rainfall falling from the afternoon storms and hurricanes has likely increased,\" he said. \"The pump is primed, if you will. I like to say these hurricanes probably are a little juicier because of the additional water vapor capacity.\"\n\nThe atmosphere today holds about 10 percent more moisture, said Brian Soden, professor of atmospheric sciences at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science at the University of Miami.\n\n\"It just compounds the problems you get from hurricanes,\" he said. \"You have not just the wind but more intense rain events. You have storm surge and higher sea levels, and gradually the sea levels rise higher. That means it takes longer for the rainfall to run off into the ocean in coastal regions, and that further compounds the flooding problems you experience.\"\n\nDebby was the second hurricane to menace the U.S. this year, after Beryl offered an explosive start to the season as the earliest category 5 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Beryl lost strength before making landfall July 8 as a category 1 storm near Matagorda, Texas, between Corpus Christi and Galveston. The hurricane season begins June 1 and peaks in August and September before ending Nov. 1.\n\nNOAA had predicted an extraordinarily active season with 17 to 25 named storms, the greatest number the federal agency had projected since the forecasts began in 1998. The agency expected eight to 13 hurricanes and four to seven major hurricanes of category 3, 4 or 5 strength, packing winds of 111 miles an hour or more.\n\nNOAA based its unprecedented forecast on a confluence of factors, most notably unusually warm sea surface temperatures, which the agency said could power more storms. The forecasters also cited an anticipated quick transition to La Ni\u00f1a conditions, leading to a decrease in wind shear or atmospheric choppiness that can weaken or break apart storms.

Sign up to receive it in your inbox.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTropical Storm Debby is creeping inland after making a second landfall on coastal South Carolina overnight. The storm has been wringing heavy rain across the southern US this week and is now threatening floods as far north as Upstate New York.\n\nDebby's top winds dropped to 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour) as it moved northwest about 90 miles from Charleston, South Carolina after coming ashore near Bulls Bay at 2 a.m. Thursday, the US National Hurricane Center said. The tropical storm will weaken as it moves overland but its downpours will continue.\n\n\"Heavy rainfall across portions of the Carolinas is expected to persist through today along with areas of considerable flooding,'' said Robbie Berg, a warning coordination meteorologist at the hurricane center. \"Heavy rainfall will also result in considerable flooding impacts across portions of the Mid-Atlantic states and northeast through Saturday morning.\"\n\nFlooding has closed roads across the Carolinas as more than 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) of rain has fallen across a wide area and many rivers are rising to major flood stage, the National Weather Service said. More than 112,000 customers are without power across the southeast with most of them in North Carolina, according to Poweroutage.usFurther north, flood watches extend from North Carolina to New York's Canadian border, the weather service said. Rainfall warnings have also been posted in Quebec, including Montreal, by Environment and Climate Change Canada. New York City will continue to see showers, but the worst of the rain will be far to the west.Debby will weaken to a tropical depression later Thursday and be absorbed by a cold front on Friday over the Mid-Atlantic before sweeping across northern New England Saturday and into Canada Sunday.\n\nIn other weather news:\n\nTexas: Heat advisories are up across most of Texas and Florida and throughout the Gulf of Mexico states as temperatures and humidity wilt the region. The high temperature in Dallas is forecast to reach 104F and with humidity feel closer to 109F Thursday, the National Weather Service said. Houston, the fourth most populous US city, will reach 100F Thursday and 101F Friday with humidity making it feel closer to 108.\n\nCalifornia: The state's Park Fire, near Chico, has grown to 425,360 acres and is now 34% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It is the fourth largest blaze in state history.\n\nTropics: Tropical Storm Maria will move parallel to Japan's east coast before possibly making landfall in a much weaker state next week in northern Honshu or Hokkaido. Tracks in the western Pacific can vary wildly.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

But this is the last day of the big stall. The system will begin its move to the north tonight and shoot quickly into the mid-Atlantic and Northeast tomorrow, taking its flooding rains with it.\n\nWidespread rainfall of 12 to 15 inches has already fallen across the Carolinas, and 3 to 6 more inches are forecast in North Carolina today. Some areas are expected to receive a total of 2 feet. Unfortunately, the dangerous flooding will not end when Debby moves out because the water that fell in the Midlands of South Carolina and the Piedmont of North Carolina still has to drain to the ocean. Rivers, creeks and streams may overflow their banks, impacting surrounding roads, bridges and neighborhoods.\n\nIt's critical that everyone in the Carolinas stays in close touch with local officials for information and instructions about flooded areas.\n\nIn addition, tornadoes continue to be a threat in North Carolina in Debby's intense outer bands. Most of the tornadoes are not very strong, but some have done significant damage. If you are under a rain band, be aware that a fast-moving tornado is possible at any time.\n\nThe flood threat will move north later today, affecting the mountainous areas, including the western parts of Virginia and West Virginia and all the way to the Northeast. The heaviest rain will fall inland away from the coast, but the I-95 corridor will be impacted tomorrow as well.\n\nA cold front sweeping from the west will push the remnants of Debby offshore and give everybody a chance to dry out on Saturday.\n\nElsewhere in the tropics, the consensus of the computer forecast models is that a smudge of disturbed weather in the eastern Atlantic could develop into at least a tropical depression somewhere near the northeastern Caribbean islands around the middle of next week. There is no system to follow at this point, so forecasts are subject to change, of course.\n\nMore well-defined disturbances are developing over Africa, so we will likely have more systems to watch after the middle of the month.", "source": {"uri": "foxweather.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Weather"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_norcross@foxweather.com", "name": "Bryan Norcross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolinas", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carolinas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainband", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rainband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mid-Atlantic (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlands_of_South_Carolina", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midlands of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piedmont (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_weather_prediction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Numerical weather prediction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_95", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 95"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_front", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tropics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Earth_Lights", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Earth Lights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Recreation_and_Leisure_Studies", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Recreation and Leisure Studies", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.foxweather.com/static.foxweather.com/www.foxweather.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1024/512/hurricane-hq-1.png?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799531", "eventUri": "eng-9799531", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Climate Change Is Making Storms Like This Even Wetter - Inside Climate News", "body": "Warming temperatures and increased water vapor are powering more intense downpours, like those associated with Debby.\n\nTropical Storm Debby, a plodding, waterlogged system that has already saturated four southeastern states, bears many characteristics of a warming planet, climate scientists say. It's reminiscent of other catastrophic tropical cyclones that have battered the United States over the past eight years.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the storm was drifting at 5 mph near the South Carolina coast, about the pace of a monarch butterfly. It is expected to pick up speed today as it heads through North Carolina, where a foot or more of rain could fall in the southeastern part of the state and 6 to 8 inches are anticipated in the central Piedmont.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency this week, warning residents on Wednesday to \"be prepared for a deluge.\"\n\nA warmer atmosphere holds more water; likewise, warmer temperatures accelerate evaporation. \"There's a lot of water in this system that's just ready to come out,\" North Carolina's state climatologist, Kathie Dello, said. \"We're pulling more of that moisture into the air and essentially supercharging the atmosphere. Or, as I like to say, get a cup of coffee and pour in a few shots of espresso.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby has arrived in what is on track to be one of the top 10 warmest years on record in North Carolina. As recently as late June, 99 of the state's 100 counties were experiencing drought conditions ranging from abnormally dry to severe, according to the State Climate Office.\n\nThat pattern reversed in July, when several cities reported their wettest July on record.\n\n\"Swings between wet and dry are something that we're expecting with climate change,\" Dello said. \"The extremes become more extreme.\"\n\nTropical Storm Debby is reminiscent of two historic hurricanes that hit North Carolina -- Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018. Although both were Category 1 storms, they caused disproportionate damage because they stalled over land and dumped historic amounts of rain -- as much as 3 feet -- in eastern North Carolina. Thousands of people were left homeless and damages totaled in the billions of dollars.\n\nTropical storms and hurricanes are producing heavier rain over the U.S., an indicator of climate change, according to a study published last month in the Journal of Climate, a publication of the American Meteorological Society.\n\nJohn Uehling co-authored the paper with Carl Schreck III, both of whom are scientists at the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies.\n\nUehling told Inside Climate News that Tropical Storm Debby is \"a classic case of what we've seen a lot in recent years,\" including with Hurricanes Harvey and Florence, \"where we have a stalling storm near the coastline that basically dumps rain over the same areas for an extended and prolonged period of time.\"\n\nUsing historical rainfall gauge data, Uehling and Schreck found that instances of heavy rain associated with tropical cyclones are becoming more frequent and extreme. Major hurricanes -- those in categories 3 through 5 -- show the largest increases in extreme rainfall.\n\n\"The real impact that we're seeing is where the worst events are getting significantly worse,\" Uehling said, whereas, in general \"your more run-of-the-mill events are not increasing at nearly the same rate.\"\n\nThe study's findings could help local governments, planners and residents prepare for these weather disasters to occur more frequently, Uehling said.\n\nThat includes inland areas in particular, where the study found the highest increases in rainfall: Alabama and Mississippi through southern Appalachia, including the mountains of North Carolina. Flooding in higher elevations presents different threats -- including mudslides and more challenging evacuations -- than coastal areas.\n\n\"Places that have not been used to dealing with these kinds of threats are going to have to start dealing with them more often,\" Uehling said.\n\n\"It's important that people keep in mind that our climate is changing, that these sort of events are occurring with more and more frequency, and that the impacts seem to be getting greater,\" he said. \"We have a duty as a society not only to mitigate against these changes, but to do what we can to prevent them from getting worse.\"\n\nDebby made landfall Monday morning near Steinhatchee, Fla., in the state's sparsely populated Big Bend region, so named for the way the peninsula meets the Panhandle. The category 1 storm forged a path similar to that of last year's Idalia, a category 3 hurricane that was the strongest to strike this part of the state since 1896.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Floridians lost power and Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 61 of the state's 67 counties. More than 9,400 feet of what his administration characterized as flood protection devices were deployed at critical infrastructure sites such as schools, health care facilities and roads and bridges. For the first time flood control barriers also were positioned around utility substations, to try to prevent more power outages, his administration said.\n\nFlorida officials feared more flooding later in the week, as water continued to flow south from the rain-soaked states of Georgia and the Carolinas. By Wednesday, the Florida Division of Emergency Management had pumped more than 104 million gallons of floodwater from communities across the state, the DeSantis administration said.\n\n\"This could take anywhere from three to seven days,\" said Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, of the duration of the flooding in the state. \"This is going to be about a weeklong event that we're going to be monitoring.\"\n\nSome of the worst flooding occurred about 200 miles from the Big Bend region in Sarasota, a beachy community south of Tampa. As much as 12 to 18 inches of rain pummeled the community as Debby's outer bands swirled some 80 miles offshore. The totals constituted some of the highest rainfall amounts in the state, said Tony Hurt, meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Ruskin, outside of Tampa. Florida typically receives roughly 50 inches of rain annually.\n\nAt least 500 Sarasota residents were rescued from flooded houses, according to the police department. To the north, in neighboring Manatee County, 186 residents were rescued, the local government said. Officials characterized the rainfall as record-breaking.\n\n\"Any kind of event like this you just try to be as prepared and stay as flexible as you can,\" said Terry Chapman, minister at the South Trail Church of Christ in Sarasota. \"We are thankful that it was not worse.\"\n\nSome of the church's parishioners had friends and family members who were affected by the flooding, and the congregation was considering the best ways to offer help. One area that was especially hard-hit was east of Interstate 75, well away from the Gulf Coast.\n\n\"Those are newer houses,\" Chapman said. \"Those are houses that were built within the last 20 years.\"\n\nWarm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico powered a rapid intensification of Debby, a phenomenon that is becoming more common because of climate change. The warming climate also is leading to more water evaporation, producing more water vapor that can feed heavy downpours like those experienced with Debby, said Marshall Shepherd, director of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the University of Georgia.\n\n\"It just compounds the problems you get from hurricanes.\"\n\n\"For Floridians, the intensity of the rainfall falling from the afternoon storms and hurricanes has likely increased,\" he said. \"The pump is primed, if you will. I like to say these hurricanes probably are a little juicier because of the additional water vapor capacity.\"\n\nThe atmosphere today holds about 10 percent more moisture, said Brian Soden, professor of atmospheric sciences at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science at the University of Miami.\n\n\"It just compounds the problems you get from hurricanes,\" he said. \"You have not just the wind but more intense rain events. You have storm surge and higher sea levels, and gradually the sea levels rise higher. That means it takes longer for the rainfall to run off into the ocean in coastal regions, and that further compounds the flooding problems you experience.\"\n\nDebby was the second hurricane to menace the U.S. this year, after Beryl offered an explosive start to the season as the earliest category 5 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Beryl lost strength before making landfall July 8 as a category 1 storm near Matagorda, Texas, between Corpus Christi and Galveston. The hurricane season begins June 1 and peaks in August and September before ending Nov. 1.\n\nNOAA had predicted an extraordinarily active season with 17 to 25 named storms, the greatest number the federal agency had projected since the forecasts began in 1998. The agency expected eight to 13 hurricanes and four to seven major hurricanes of category 3, 4 or 5 strength, packing winds of 111 miles an hour or more.\n\nNOAA based its unprecedented forecast on a confluence of factors, most notably unusually warm sea surface temperatures, which the agency said could power more storms. The forecasters also cited an anticipated quick transition to La Ni\u00f1a conditions, leading to a decrease in wind shear or atmospheric choppiness that can weaken or break apart storms. The average season features 14 named storms, including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes.", "source": {"uri": "insideclimatenews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "InsideClimate News"},

Heavy rainfall is expected to persist throughout the day and into the evening with \"considerable flooding impacts\" up to the Mid-Atlantic state and Northeast until at least Saturday morning, the NHC added.\n\nTropical storm conditions will likely cause coastal flooding in South and North Carolina on Thursday. And I was up all night with tornado warnings further inland.\n\nA radar graphic shared by storm chaser Reed Timmer showed \"a massive plume of heavy tropical rainfall with feeder bands pumping off the warm Atlantic Ocean,\" bringing \"big problems tomorrow up through the Roanoke area.\" (RELATED: Tornado That Hit Buffalo Might Be Something Even More Insane)\n\nThe system covers an area stretching from Florence, South Carolina, through Fayetteville and Raleigh, with two significant areas of concern around the Goldsboro area, near Seymour Johnson Air Force Base.\n\n\"Tropical cyclones are the most efficient tornado producers,\" Timmer told the Daily Caller via text.\n\nI told him the skies looked like they were brightening up in the area. \"When those breaks in the clouds come it could lead to more of a tornado threat,\" he replied.\n\nAt least two tornadoes have hit the region at the time of writing. Other forecasters warned residents of North Carolina to be on high alert throughout the rest of the day Thursday through into Friday morning.

Incidentally, he's the last Tribesman to have won the award.\n\nSpeaking to Des Cahill on RT\u00c9's Morning Ireland, a saddened Farrell recounted his chance encounter with Keady outside HQ last Sunday, before paying tribute to a man he described as 'bigger than life'.\n\n\"It's hard to believe. [I was] talking to him outside Croke Park before the match last Sunday, and [he was] always in great form and always kind of out for the craic, telling me, 'Sure I wouldn't come at all only we're playing Tipperary!' - this sort of stuff,\" Farrell said.\n\n\"He never missed a match. Great family man. Came into me as a young lad - brilliant hurler, brilliant player - and the bigger the occasion the better he played.\n\nHe'd believe, like, if there was 70,000 in Croke Park, well, they came to see him play. 'Sure this is what we're training for.' You know what I mean? He had a free spirit.\n\n\"There was no problem with self-confidence. Especially [on] the big day. He lived for the big day, he'd say, 'This is what we're training for', and on all the big occasions he played very, very well.\"\n\nFarrell expressed his sympathy for Keady's wife, Margaret, and Keady's four young children, while explaining that the shock and sadness surrounding his loss will have impacted the entire county, such was the regard with which he was held in Galway and across the country.\n\n\"Your heart would go out to Margaret and the kids. They're heartbroken. They had a few days there in the hospital, hoping and hoping and hoping, and everyone's hoping, because this character is bigger than life. And so fit and strong. He's the last person, if you looked at him, that you could think this would happen, but that's life.\n\n\"It's a very sad day for Margaret and the kids, but for everyone in Galway, because this guy was known everywhere.\"\n\nKeady is one of just three Galway players to win Hurler of the Year, with Joe Cooney preceding him '87 and Joe Connolly being the first seven years earlier.\n\nThe Killimordaly man is widely regarded as one of the best centre backs to ever puck a ball.\n\nYou can listen to Farrell's conversation with Des Cahill below.\n\nThe 42 is on Instagram!

Eventually they played the game against Tipperary under protest.\n\nIrishCentral has obtained the actual letter all these years later that revealed Keady had played under a false name in New York and which led to his 12-month suspension. It was written by Norbert Hennessy, a very colorful figure who ran an Irish bar at the time called Hennessy's headquarters and who was very active with the Tipperary-New York team where he was chairman.\n\n2\n\nThe Tom Keady scandal: actual New York letter that created one of Ireland's biggest ever sporting controversies.\n\nThe Galway team Keady starred on was going for an historic third consecutive All Ireland hurling championship. They were to meet their archrivals Tipperary in the semi-final match-up. Keady could not and did not play and Galway lost and they haven't won an All-Ireland hurling final since. It is like a curse lies on the team that was so dominant in the Keady era.\n\nKeady was a magnificent hurler, one of the best. He died tragically young at age 53 of a heart attack this week.\n\nHis death reignited the arguments about what happened during the summer of 1989 in New York when the Galway man became the center of news and sports coverage all over Ireland and in the Irish American media. The 'Tony Keady Affair,' as it became known, was one of the biggest sports stories of the decade.\n\nNew York's Gaelic Park in the 1980s\n\nAt the time, players from Ireland were flown in every weekend to play in games at Gaelic Park. There were always rumors that big bets were placed on such games and that the players from Ireland were highly prized and highly paid. The rules covering such maneuverings, players brought over from Ireland for big matches, were hazy and rarely, if ever, enforced. However, the potential for trouble arising from famous players playing under fake identities proved all too real for Tony Keady.\n\nKeady had come to New York earlier that year with the winning Galway team to play a match against an All Star selection. He stayed on when the Galway team went back home and it soon became known that Ireland's finest hurler was about town.\n\nThe New York GAA rulebook stated that a player from Ireland on a tour couldn't play with a local GAA team, and furthermore he could not play for a New York team for at least a month after if he stayed on, as many players did when the team got to America.\n\nThe Laois-New York hurling team under Galway man Monty Moloney wanted to snap up Keady. Though nominally Laois, the team was mostly Galway men and if Keady came on board their chances of success would be greatly boosted.\n\nThe Laois-New York team had a vital game coming up with Tipperary-New York in Gaelic Park in the Bronx. Would Keady decide to play?\n\nPlay he did and he led Laois to a whopping victory, destroying the Tipperary-New York team. Keady knew the rules were murky, but in a much-quoted remark he said the sight of the Tipperary jersey was such a come-on that he decided there and then to play.\n\nShortly thereafter Tipperary-New York, through the letter reproduced here for the first time, objected to Keady.\n\nAt that point, it was an internal New York GAA matter and Keady was intent on going home to play for Galway in their bid for three All Ireland titles in a row. Tipperary-New York won the objection and were awarded the game. There the matter might have rested.\n\nGAA crackdown\n\nHowever, GAA authorities in Ireland, long seeking to regulate the flow of GAA players to America, decided this was their opportunity to crack down and who better to crack down on than a legendary figure of the game.\n\nDespite a series of appeals, Keady was suspended for a year on his return and Galway lost to Tipperary. For a man who was clearly hard done by given the rules governing players playing in the US were barely observed, Keady took his punishment gracefully but he was never the same player after.\n\nConspiracy theories still abound that the Tipp chairman in New York did it deliberately to get Keady banned back home.\n\nThat has been strongly denied in an interview with IrishCentral by Norbert Hennessy.\n\n\"I lodged the objection solely because Laois played illegal players,\" he says. \"The GAA in Ireland got involved. It was taken out of our hands. We never, ever visualized Keady being suspended in Ireland.\"\n\nIn a strange postscript, Tipperary went on to win the All-Ireland and Norbert Hennessy, as Chairman of Tipperary-New York, was at first invited into the winner's dressing room and then asked to leave. It seemed that even in archrival Tipperary circles there was real sympathy for Keady.", "timeCrawl": "09:09:00", "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Keady"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8575195", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Now, will you come with me and (Brendan) Lynskey for a drink?\"\n\nEvery night at training, Cyril Farrell would put Piggott on Keady. It was all out war.\n\nThe two men went at each other like stags in a Glen. When Piggott would see Keady using his favourite hurley, tanned with linseed oil, his mission was to try and smash it.\n\nHe did everything to try and break Keady. Piggott never did.\n\nKeady was never more prepared and battle-hardened for that 1988 final. He wanted to celebrate the victory afterwards in his own way.\n\nKeady and Lynskey left the dressing room and headed home to their house in Phibsboro.\n\nThey had a cup of tea, threw on their suits and went straight to their local, the Hut. The owner, Bob McGowan, had promised a champagne reception if they beat Tipperary. The corks were popped. The entire staff dressed for the occasion in maroon and white. Farrell rang to tell Keady and Lynskey to head straight to the Burlington Hotel. They never did.\n\nThey watched The Sunday Game in the Hut. When Keady was named man-of-the-match, the place erupted. Farrell accepted the award. Keady eventually arrived back at the hotel later that night. When Ger Canning finally collared him, he asked him why he wasn't around to accept his award. \"Sure,\" said Keady, \"didn't everyone already know that they gave it to me at half-time.\"\n\nThat short story encapsulated so much about the late Tony Keady; loyal, appreciative, confident, great fun, someone who did things his way. Keady didn't follow convention because he was such a unique character.\n\nBefore that final, Keady was asked in an interview what was his favourite food. \"A mug of tea and lasagne,\" was his reply. When the players read the line, they jumped on it at training the next evening like lions.\n\n\"Nobody in Killimordaly had ever heard of lasagne,\" said Keady. \"I read it somewhere and just said it for the craic.\"\n\nThe Galway players loved Keady. He lit up the place with his wit. When a raft of them got married around that time, they all wanted to be at Keady's table. He loved to sing. When he went up on stage to sing one song though, Keady invariably sang three.\n\nKeady loved music. Around 25 years ago, Keady and his former teacher, the late Eugene Kelly, loosely co-wrote a song called 'Galway's Heroes'. Years later, Keady mentioned it to Ollie Turner in Galway Bay FM, who recorded it before the 2012 All-Ireland final. Keady rejigged the players' names and gave it another spin before the 2015 All-Ireland final.\n\nThe depth of his character, the sheer weight of his personality endeared him to the Galway public but Keady was loved everywhere for his class and iron hardness.\n\nA steel fist in a velvet glove. The first time Keady pricked the national consciousness was the 1985 All-Ireland semi-final against Cork, played in a monsoon on what resembled a paddy-field.\n\nKeady, the young pretender, faced off that day with Cork's grizzly old warrior, Tim Crowley. The second ball that came between them got stuck in the muck and Keady and Crowley pulled repeatedly, like they were threshing. That game launched the Galway crusade in the latter half of the 1980s. With Pete Finnerty beside Keady, that day was also the first showing of Galway's greatest half-back line, which was later completed by Gerry McInerney.\n\nThey bestrode the game like giants, bristling with attitude, class, and power. They hoovered up individual awards but their status was so high that their names bled into each other like a phrase; Finnerty, Keady, McInerney.\n\nAs Galway contested five All-Ireland finals in six years, Keady was hurling's dominant centre-back. His last championship match in Croke Park was in 1991.\n\nHis inter-county career was over by 29, but Keady was such a colossus that he was probably the first modern centre-back. He tended to mark space rather than his man but he was so strong under a dropping ball that few centre-forwards could beat him.\n\nHis long-range free-taking was exceptional but his mindset set him apart. His team-mates always said that Keady grew six inches taller when he went into Croke Park. The bigger the occasion, the better he performed. He was fearless.\n\nHis infamous suspension for the 1989 All-Ireland semi-final stole some light from his\n\ncareer but it still didn't cloud Keady's greatness as a hurler.\n\nIf anything, the misfortune of that time, added to his cult status and iconic standing on that Galway team.\n\nKeady won two All-Irelands and was selected as Hurler-of-the-Year in 1988 but his greatest achievement was his family; his wife Margaret, and their four children -- Shannon, Anthony, and the twins, Jake and Harry.\n\n\"Tony absolutely idolised his family,\" says one former team-mate. \"Everything he did revolved around them.\"\n\nThey were the centre of his world but Keady always had that capacity to make people feel important, to treat them with total respect. \"I was fortunate to win All-Irelands,\" says Pearse Piggott.\n\n\"But my greatest sporting memory is Tony thanking me after that 1988 All-Ireland final. I've never told anyone that before but that's how special Tony made me feel. Tony was a great hurler but he was blessed with buckets and buckets of good nature.\"\n\nThat good nature touched everyone. When a friend of Piggott's opened a business in Oranmore last year, Keady went into the shop, welcomed him to Oranmore and told him that he and his family would support him.\n\nKeady never even knew the man was a friend of Piggott's but Piggott wouldn't have expected anything else from Keady.\n\nFor a tribute show on Galway Bay FM this morning, Sean Walsh pre-recorded a number of interviews with former players and GAA personalities around the country.\n\nJoe Sherry, a publican from Clarinbridge, encapsulated much of the mood which has blackened the county.\n\n\"Thousands of people feel like they have lost their best friend,\" said Sherry. \"Because Tony Keady made everyone feel like he was their best friend.\"\n\nAn icon has sadly passed.\n\nAnd hurling people everywhere have felt that deep loss of one of the game's most cherished and loved warriors.", "timeCrawl": "00:21:00", "sim": 0.772549033164978, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8511679", "categories": [], "details": {"liCnt": 96}}

For younger fans, this is Diarmuid Connolly's current 12-week suspension and the coverage and rancour it provoked times a thousand.\n\nHaving lost the All-Ireland finals of 1985 and '86, Galway recorded back-to-back Liam MacCarthy Cup wins in the following two years.\n\nThey were the dominant force at the time, in 1989 they were going for three in-a-row and Keady, who died at just 53-years-old on Wednesday, was their rock at centre-back. This was a player of style and substance and manager Cyril Farrell built a brilliant defence around him.\n\nHaving won the 1988/'89 National League (back then it was split before and after Christmas) Galway had three months off before they entered the All-Ireland championship at the semi-final stage.\n\nAs reigning Hurler of the Year, Keady was part of the All Star team that travelled to New York in May 1989 and he liked it so much he decided that he was going to stay for a while.\n\n\"I had a brother, Bernard, over there and I was thinking of staying over there at the time. Only the bit of success was coming I probably would have gone a bit earlier,\" said Keady, in an interview with Newstalk in 2015.\n\n\"I stayed over. I didn't think there'd be any major complications, as far as I knew I was going to come back and play but little did I know it was going to turn out the way it did.\"\n\nBack then it was routine for star inter-county players to travel back and forth from Ireland to the east coast of the States to play big club games. Money often changed hands and as the GAA in the Big Apple wasn't formally recognised by Croke Park at the time, a blind eye was turned.\n\nKeady, then a 25-year-old with the game in the palm of his hand, was persuaded to line out under his brother's name for the Laois side, and though they were called Laois they were backboned by Galway men, against Tipperary. At home Tipp were the Tribesmen's main rivals for Liam MacCarthy having lost the '88 final, their first in 17 years, by four points.\n\n\"We were pucking about and they were announcing the team,\" he recalled.\n\n\"A ball went out over to the wire and as I was going over to the wire it just hit off number six 'Bernard Keady'. Someone said to me at the wire 'howaya, Tony. That's not you, is it?'\n\n\"It went out of proportion because we won that game by 15 or 16 points and if four or five of us didn't play we still would have won it. I just thought all along that it would all just settle down.\n\n\"You go through all these meetings and thinking that it would all work out and I'd be able to hurl. I remember Cyril saying I'd get off. A lot of people didn't know about the GAA or hurling at the time and they were suspending me.\"\n\nSomeone on the Tipp side objected to his presence and Keady was suspended for two games in New York. But then someone got wind of this news back home and Croke Park's Games Administration Committee swung into action. Keady got 12 months.\n\nIt still isn't clear why the Killimordaly man was the one - and only - they decided to make an example of. Tipp's Paul Delaney did the exact same thing and played in the contentious All-Ireland semi-final in 1989.\n\nGalway moved heaven and earth in order to try to have their star player's name cleared. Farrell threatened to pull his team out of the semi-final against Tipp, prompting Croke Park to call an emergency meeting of their powerful Management Committee.\n\nTipperary's delegate voted to allow Keady play against his own county, but the four non-hurling counties in Connacht, much to Galway's lingering disgust, gave the appeal the thumbs down and Keady lost the vote 20-18.\n\nThe 12-month ban stood and he would have to sit out the semi-final, a highly-anticipated rematch of the previous year's All-Ireland.\n\nIn the end the bad feeling spilled out onto the pitch in a fractious match that saw Galway duo Sylvie Linnane and Michael 'Hopper' McGrath get the line. Tipperary came out on top and went on to win the All-Ireland.\n\n\"They probably wanted to make a stance around that time and with us going for a three in-a-row there was going to be hype so they might have said that they'd make a scapegoat of this fellah,\" said Keady.\n\n\"I don't really know, to be honest, why they did it and why they didn't see sense.\"\n\nKeady carried no bitterness about losing that match, in fact he graciously said his stand-in Sean Treacy put on a better display than he could have managed in the number six jersey, but it was clear that he never really got over the mean-spirited actions witnessed in GAA committee rooms at the time.", "timeCrawl": "17:44:00", "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8456193", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic", "id": 1366, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

He was joined by Canon Michael McLoughlin, who was appointed the administrator of the Galway diocese following the retirement last year of Bishop Martin Drennan. Seven other priests concelebrated the mass.\n\nTony Keady was centre-back on the Galway team that won two All-Irelands in 1987 and '88, was voted Hurler of the Year in 1988, and also won All-Stars in 1986 and '88.\n\nOne of his other Galway teammates from that era, Pete Finnerty, brought the hurley that Mr Keady used when he won the man-of-the-match award against Tipperary in the 1988 decider, to the altar.\n\nMr Keady's only daughter Shannon paid a touching tribute to her father and said that he was the greatest centre-back, on and off the pitch.\n\n\"Dad is my idol and the great centre-back of all time.

Centre back on the team, which recorded back-to-back titles in 1987-88 and twice an All Star, he was also named Hurler of the Year in 1988, recognition of his outstanding performances.\n\nIf his career was both short - he played his last intercounty match before he was 30 - and splashed with a singular controversy, neither feature has done anything even to asterisk the immensely high regard in which he is held in the hurling community as one of the great players.\n\nHe always resented greatly the suspension imposed on him for playing without authorisation in the United States, arguing that he had been misled by assurances from the Laois club in New York that he was eligible to play. The suspension ruled him out of Galway's All-Ireland 1989 semi-final against Tipperary, the third time the counties had met in successive championships.\n\nWith his team going for three-in-a-row, Tony Keady would miss the biggest match of the season.\n\nIn what is now a haunting line from the Laochra Gael programme dedicated to him, he answered the question as to what he felt should be his epitaph by saying, \"They should have let me play in '89!\"\n\nA commanding figure at the heart of arguably the most famous half-back line in hurling flanked by Peter Finnerty and Gerry McInerney, he was also a terrific striker of the ball. With his white helmet and elemental displays in the biggest matches he was one of the great figures of a team whose legend burned brightly, as Galway struggled to recapture the Liam MacCarthy in the decades that followed.\n\nConor Hayes captained the back-to-back teams and remembers the man who hurled in front of him in the spine of the defence.\n\n\"He was one of our best players. When he turned it on, there was nothing to touch him,\" said Hayes. \"He could be ordinary enough in league games but the bigger the occasion, the better he was. His best performances came on the big days in Croke Park. He seemed to be nerveless going out onto the pitch. If you look at the old footage you'd see the likes of me nudging him and poking him with the hurl to get him going but he never needed it.\n\n\"There were a lot of oul' myths about him - that he drank a lot and was a renegade - but it was rubbish. If anything, he was particularly aware of the importance of minding yourself and I remember him giving out about other fellas smoking.\n\n\"He always looked after himself and up until the end he had maintained his fighting weight and was very fit looking. As a hurler he was as good a centre back as I've ever seen and when you needed him on the big day he was outstanding.\"\n\nThe Irish Times hurling analyst Nicky English captained Tipperary in the 1988 All-Ireland final and was centrally involved in the big matches of that era.\n\n\"It was a great rivalry and then in 1989 when he was suspended - something that for the Tipperary players was going on in the background - we missed him and he was a huge loss to them, no question about it.\n\n\"My heart goes out to his family and Galway hurling. He was such a strong and able boy is the way I'd put it - that it's hard to believe he's gone so early. He was a powerful figure on that team. Not the biggest but he was unbelievably strong and at a time when strength was sometimes used just to overwhelm opponents he was a brilliant hurler as well.\n\n\"With that strength to get under the dropping ball at centre back he was able to win possession and strike superbly. Sixty-fives or 70s as they were back then weren't a given at that time and forward free takers would not go out that far because they didn't have that range. He was the best of that era at hitting them, and farther out.\n\n\"I think everyone's been struck by the timing of it as well. This is as good a chance as Galway have had since 1988 to win the All-Ireland. It's hard to believe that he could have been at the semi-final enjoying that thriller on Sunday and watching Galway come out the right side but that he won't be around for the final.\"\n\nHayes believes that he would have been an adornment to hurling in whatever era he played.\n\n\"People ask me how he'd do in the modern game and I laugh at them. Could you imagine Keady as a sweeper? He's absolutely mop up in that kind of a scenario. He'd read the game well and he could drive the ball a distance and with accuracy. He was excellent at catching - he had all the skills.\n\n\"I called out to see him last year and his children are enthusiastic about the game. He had this mini-pitch out the back with goalposts and nets down the back. He still had that love for the sport and was a great family man, which is the saddest thing about it.\n\n\"Even to say that he's dead is still utterly beyond belief. Even yesterday I was still hoping that we'd get news that he'd pulled out of it and was improving and that something would happen and he'd be okay again.\n\n\"You always felt that he'd make it because he'd always rise to the occasion and produce a performance when it was needed but this time the odds were stacked too heavily against him.\"", "timeCrawl": "16:52:00", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8447675", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Ron DeSantis also running for the GOP presidential nomination, but even with their home-state governor in the race, Florida party officials signaled they would back Trump.\n\nIn September, party leaders voted to remove a loyalty pledge requirement that would have required GOP presidential candidates to support the eventual Republican nominee to be on the state's March 19 primary ballot. The proposal was supported by Trump but openly opposed by DeSantis' campaign.\n\nBeyond Trump family members, the Florida GOP approved several of the former president's top supporters as RNC at-large delegates.\n\nOthers include Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.'s fianc\u00e9e; Michael Boulous, Tiffany Trump's husband; former state Attorney General Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump ally who has run pro-Trump super PACs; longtime Trump adviser Sergio Gor; former Marvel Entertainment Chairman Ike Perlmutter, a prominent Trump donor;

Ron DeSantis also running for the GOP presidential nomination, but even with their home-state governor in the race, Florida party officials signaled they would back Trump.\n\nIn September, party leaders voted to remove a loyalty pledge requirement that would have required GOP presidential candidates to support the eventual Republican nominee to be on the state's March 19 primary ballot. The proposal was supported by Trump but openly opposed by DeSantis' campaign.\n\nBeyond Trump family members, the Florida GOP approved several of the former president's top supporters as RNC at-large delegates.\n\nOthers include Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Trump Jr.'s fianc\u00e9e; Michael Boulous, Tiffany Trump's husband; former state Attorney General Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump ally who has run pro-Trump super PACs; longtime Trump adviser Sergio Gor; former Marvel Entertainment Chairman Ike Perlmutter, a prominent Trump donor; and a series of state-level Republican politicians who took the risk of endorsing Trump over DeSantis.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The youngest son of former President Donald Trump and his wife Melania is set to enter politics this summer, taking on a role as a Florida delegate at the Republican National Convention.\n\nBarron was chosen by the Republican Party of Florida to represent the state as an at-large delegate at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, as reported by first by NBC News. The 18-year-old is set to graduate from a private West Palm Beach high school next week, and his role as a GOP delegate will mark the first time he has joined the rest of his family in the political arena. In fact, three of his older siblings have also been chosen as Republican delegates for Florida. Barron will be joined by Eric Trump, Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos, as well as Donald Trump Jr. and his fiancee Kimberly Guilfoyle. Trump won the GOP primary in Florida in March, which meant he was able to secure the state's 125 Republican delegates.\n\nIvanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, who both served as White House advisors when Trump was in office, have made the decision to not get involved in her father's campaign this time around. Eric Trump's wife Lara Trump is playing a larger role by acting as the newly elected co-chair for the Republican National Convention.\n\nUntil this recent appointment, Barron Trump has been heavily shielded from the public eye. He was still a child when his father was in the White House, and in the early months of Trump's presidency he and his mother Melania Trump remained in New York City so Barron could still attend private school there.\n\nWhile his older siblings have all been heavily active in their father's political campaign, Barron Trump's new role as a GOP delegate for Florida marks his first step into the political arena. A step he is reportedly very interested in, according to a campaign official who told ABC News, \"Yes, he's on the delegation roster and Barron is very interested in our nation's political process.\"", "source": {"uri": "romper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Romper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Guilfoyle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Guilfoyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Kushner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Kushner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lara_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lara Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2024/5/9/2fadd1aa-0ffc-4127-92ff-24220b75e726-getty-1242024113.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&fm=jpg&fp-x=0.521&fp-y=0.3406", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551868", "eventUri": "eng-9551868", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

He is set to graduate from Oxbridge Academy, a private high school near his father's Florida estate at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, on May 17. The former president obtained permission from the judge in his hush-money trial in New York to attend the ceremony, after he complained that the trial could make it impossible for him to do so.\n\nThe new slate of GOP delegates in Florida is the latest example of the omnipresence of the Trump family in Republican Party politics.

Tiffany joined her siblings in the 2020 campaign but Barron stayed out of sight.\n\nIvanka, who served as a senior adviser to her father in his White House, made it clear she was out of politics when Donald Trump announced he was running for president again.\n\n'I love my father very much,' she said at the time. 'This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.'\n\nBarron, who turned 18 last month, returned to the spotlight with Donald Trump's hush-money trial when the former president argued he should be allowed a break from trial to attend Barron Trump's May 17 high school graduation.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan agreed to allow the break in the trial.\n\nDonald Trump won Florida twice - in the 2016 and 2020 elections. But Republicans in the state were in a tough spot in the 2020 GOP contest because Gov.

His selection underlines how deeply the Trump family has become involved in Republican politics. Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law, was named co-chair of the Republican National Committee in March. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., Barron's older brothers, have been active on the campaign trail. Both are also on Florida's 41-person delegate list for the convention in Milwaukee, the campaign official said, along with Tiffany Trump, Trump youngest daughter.\n\nIvanka Trump, Trump's older daughter, is the only child of the former president not on the delegate roster. Delegates are allocated following primary contests in each state. While the rules are complex, delegates are typically assigned to represent a candidate at the convention, where the nominee is officially selected.\n\nGiven Trump's domination of the Republican nominating contest, almost all delegates in Milwaukee will be supporting the former president.

Ivanka Trump, a Florida resident, is not one of the 125 delegates the state is sending to the Republican National Convention to formally nominate Donald Trump as the GOP presidential nominee.\n\nThe former first daughter has stepped away from politics and it's unclear if she'll even attend the event, which takes place in Milwaukee from Monday, July 15 to Thursday, July 18. However, Don Jr. and his fiance Kimberly Guilfoyle, Eric Trump, Tiffany Trump and her husband Michael Boulos are all delegates at large along with younger brother.\n\nLara Trump - Eric's wife - is vice chair of the Republican National Committee and will be at the convention in her official capacity. The Republican Party of Florida on Wednesday night picked Barron, 18, to join his older siblings for the event. The only requirement to be a delegate is to live and vote in the state.\n\nBarron graduates from Oxbridge Academy in suburban West Palm Beach next week. During Trump's White House years he was rarely seen, mainly at the request of his mother Melania who is known to be protective of her son. He was at his father's 2016 presidential announcement and attended the Republican National Conventions in both 2016 and 2020.\n\nBut sources told DailyMail.com that the 6ft 7in teen, who has never uttered a word in public, is a steadfast supporter of the Trump 2024 campaign behind the scenes. Eric Trump will serve as the Florida delegation chair, which means he will formally place his father's name in for the nomination.\n\n'We have a great delegation of grassroots leaders, elected officials and even Trump family members,' Florida GOP chairman Evan Power said. 'Florida is continuing to have a great convention team, but more importantly we are preparing to win Florida and win it big.' In Trump's last two White House campaigns, Don Jr., Eric and Ivanka were heavily involved - speaking at their father's rallies and campaigning for him. Tiffany joined her siblings in the 2020 campaign but Barron stayed out of sight.\n\nIvanka, who served as a senior adviser to her father in his White House , made it clear she was out of politics when Donald Trump announced he was running for president again. 'I love my father very much,' she said at the time. 'This time around, I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics.'\n\nBarron, who turned 18 last month, returned to the spotlight with Donald Trump's hush-money trial when the former president argued he should be allowed a break from trial to attend Barron Trump's May 17 high school graduation. Judge Juan Merchan agreed to allow the break in the trial.\n\nDonald Trump won Florida twice - in the 2016 and 2020 elections. But Republicans in the state were in a tough spot in the 2020 GOP contest because Gov. Ron DeSantis was making a bid. Ultimately DeSantis dropped out and endorsed Trump.\n\nNow the slate of delegates to the Republican convention is filled with Trump loyalists: former state Attorney General Pam Bondi, longtime Trump adviser Sergio Gor, top Trump donors and loyalists who endorsed Trump over DeSantis.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Ron] DeSantis,\" NBC reported.\n\nThe mainstream outlet made much of the former rivalry between Trump and the Florida governor, who ran against each other for the Republican presidential nomination, pointing out that the Florida GOP \"largely lined up behind\" Trump even their governor was still running in the Republican primary.\n\n\"In September, party leaders voted to remove a loyalty pledge requirement that would have required GOP presidential candidates to support the eventual Republican nominee to be on the state's March 19 primary ballot,\" NBC reported late Wednesday. \"The proposal was supported by Trump but openly opposed by DeSantis' campaign.\"\n\nNBC reached out to the Trump campaign for comment -- as did Axios -- but received no reply.\n\nBarron Trump has been in the news lately as his father has sought a break from his Manhattan trial to attend his high school graduation next week, a request Judge Juan Merchan granted.\n\nThe trial -- which NBC and other mainstream outlets continue to insist revolved around so-called \"hush money payments to an adult film star\" but is actually more accurately described as having to do with the falsification of business records -- is expected to continue into at least late May and perhaps even into June.\n\nAxios noted that of all of Donald Trump's children, only Ivanka Trump -- who announced her retirement from political activities in 2022 -- will not serve in Florida's delegation to the convention.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [],

At the time, the judge had not ruled on this request due to time constraints, but he recognized that if the prosecution progressed as planned, it would likely be adjourned for a day to facilitate the accused's attendance.\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply Read more about: Barron Trump Donald Trump Political News Republican National Convention", "source": {"uri": "uinterview.com", "dataType": "news",

a great delegation of grassroots leaders, elected officials and even Trump family members.\n\n\"Florida is continuing to have a great convention team, but more importantly we are preparing to win Florida and win it big,\" said Power.\n\nNBC News said the younger Trump's position as a delegate will be his highest-profile political role thus far.\n\nBarron Trump, who turned 18 in March, has retained much more of a private life than his older brothers, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, both of whom will also be Florida at-large RNC delegates, along with Trump's daughter Tiffany.\n\nNBC News said he was pulled into political headlines last month at the start of his father's New York criminal trial related to hush money payments to an adult film star ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nThe former president's attorneys argued that he should be allowed a break from trial to attend Barron Trump's May 17 high school graduation, which judge Juan Merchan agreed to allow.\n\nA Trump campaign

Trump's youngest son will serve as a delegate from Florida just a few months after graduating from high school.\n\nAfter years in which his privacy has been fiercely guarded and he has been kept out of the political arena, former President Donald J. Trump's youngest son, Barron, was chosen to be one of Florida's delegates to the Republican National Convention.\n\nBarron, who turned 18 earlier this year and will graduate high school this month, will be one of 41 at-large delegates at the party's national meeting in July, when the G.O.P. is expected to officially nominate his father as the Republican presidential candidate. His selection was reported earlier by NBC News.\n\nThe youngest Trump will be joined in the delegation by his two more politically active brothers, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., both of whom have appeared on the campaign trail or done interviews to support their father's candidacy.\n\nMr. Trump's younger daughter, Tiffany, will also be a Florida delegate. Ivanka Trump, his eldest child, was not on the list.\n\nThough politicians' children often hit the trail to stump alongside their parents, Barron Trump has largely been absent from his father's campaign this year. It remains to be seen whether he will give a speech at the Republican convention, as his siblings did in 2016 and 2020.\n\nFor the past several years, Barron has been attending a private high school near Florida. His graduation, on May 17, became a point of contention in Mr. Trump's hush-money trial in Manhattan because it overlaps with the court schedule.\n\nThe judge in the case initially delayed a decision on whether court would be in session that day, prompting complaints from Mr. Trump, but he eventually agreed to allow the day off from court.\n\nThe Florida party's list of delegates further demonstrates the extent to which the Trump family and Mr. Trump's supporters have moved to the center of Republican politics. His daughter-in-law, Lara, who is married to Eric Trump, was made co-chair of the Republican National Committee earlier this year.\n\nThe Florida delegation list also includes Kimberly Guilfoyle, the fianc\u00e9e of Donald Trump Jr., and Michael Boulos, Tiffany Trump's husband.

Well, I got more bad news for you chumps. He's not the only one.\n\nHere is more from the Reuters article:\n\nDonald Trump's youngest son, Barron Trump, will be one of the delegates representing Florida at the Republican National Convention in July, a notable move given that he has kept largely out of the public eye so far during the campaign.\n\nA campaign official confirmed an earlier report from NBC that Barron Trump had been selected by the state party as a delegate from Florida.\n\nBarron, 18, is \"very interested in our nation's political process,\" said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss internal campaign matters.\n\nIn Florida, presidential campaigns submit a list of proposed delegates to the state party, which in this case would have included Barron.\n\nHis selection underlines how deeply the Trump family has become involved in Republican politics. Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law, was named co-chair of the Republican National Committee in March. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., Barron's older brothers, have been active on the campaign trail. Both are also on Florida's 41-person delegate list for the convention in Milwaukee, the campaign official said, along with Tiffany Trump, Trump youngest daughter.\n\nOlder daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner served in the first Trump White House and have taken their share of the Ugly GroupThink infesting the Political Class. They should stay home and enjoy their beautiful children. Mazel Tov.\n\nAlong with Don, Jr. and Eric Trump, Barron will be joined in Milwaukee by half-sister Tiffany Trump Boulos and her husband Michael Boulos. Mr. Boulos is a billionaire heir and businessman.\n\nThe media asks if Barron Trump is still off limits\n\nAnd, more from Newsweek:\n\nAllison Gill, political commentator and host of the Mueller, She Wrote podcast, posted on X, formerly Twitter, Barron was \"no longer off limits\" while sharing NBC News' report.\n\nX user Rob Voreck said Barron's move into the world of politics is \"going to end very badly.\"\n\n\"He's now fair game to the media. I'm actually surprised. I thought Melania would do everything to prevent this but if Barron, now an adult, personally made the decision to participate in his father's circus, so be it,\" Voreck added.\n\nDevin Nunes' Alt Mom, a popular parody social media account which purported to be the mother of the former California congressman, posted: \"Barron Trump is officially fair game now.\"\n\nAnother social media user added: \"Barron Trump to step into the political arena as a Florida delegate at the Republican convention.\n\n\"Children are off limits. However, at 18, Barron is now considered an adult. Should Barron choose to enter the Republican political circus, it will be game on.\"\n\nWhen has Barron Trump been off limits? In June of 2017, Barron wore a \"The Expert\" T-shirt and held a fidget spinner and the media went bats. In November of that year, Barron had an ISIS death threat at age 11.

There, the GOP is planning to nominate President Trump as the party's 2024 presidential candidate.\n\nThe 18-year-old high school senior has been mostly hidden from public view but will graduate on May 17. His father will be allowed to attend his graduation ceremony after Judge Juan Merchan, who is overseeing President Trump's hush money trial in New York, agreed to postpone court proceedings on May 17. Previously, Judge Merchan was reluctant to allow the former president to attend the ceremony, which drew the ire of President Trump.\n\n\"We are fortunate to have a great group of grassroots leaders, elected officials, and members of the Trump family working together as part of the Florida delegation to the 2024 Republican National Convention,\" Mr. Power said in an email statement.\n\n\"The RPOF is ready for a great convention in Milwaukee, but more importantly, we are excited as we continue to lay the groundwork in Florida for success. Mark my words, we are going to win, and we will win big in November!\"\n\nMr. Power provided a full list of Florida's 41 at-large delegates to the Republican National Convention, which is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, from July 15 to July 18. President Trump's sons, Eric Trump and Don Jr. Trump, as well as his daughter Tiffany Boulos, are also 2024 delegates.\n\nThe selection of President Trump's children for at-large delegates shows how involved the former president's family is in Republican politics, particularly in Florida. His oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, was his only child who was not on the delegate list.\n\nOther at-large delegates include state Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, state Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson, state Attorney General Ashley Moody, former state Attorney General Pam Bondi, state Rep. Randy Fine (R-Brevard), U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States Carlos Trujillo, and Trump associate Kimberly Guilfoyle.\n\nMr. Barron Trump attends Oxbridge Academy, an exclusive private school near his father's Mar-a-Lago resort and home. It was reported that the former president's youngest son enrolled in the West Palm Beach school in August 2021 as a sophomore. At the time, administrators for Oxbridge Academy sent out an email to parents to notify them of Secret Service presence now that Mr. Barron Trump would be attending.\n\n\"A small contingent of [Secret Service] agents will be present during each school day,\" wrote Ralph Mauer, the school's head. \"We are working directly with the Secret Service to ensure that logistics and security work smoothly and discreetly with little impact on students, faculty, staff, or day-to-day operations.\"\n\nThe school is notable for its 2011 founding by billionaire Bill Koch, the brother of Charles and the late David Koch, who ran Koch Industries. Oxbridge Academy's annual tuition is $34,800 for high school students. Mr. Barron Trump previously attended St. Andrew's Episcopal School near Washington.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [],

The position serves as Barron's political debut, and RNC delegates have an important job.\n\nBarron is one of 2,429 delegates who will vote for the Republican nominee at the 2024 RNC in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Donald Trump has already clinched the nomination, and according to a Florida law that dictates delegates follow the primary results -- Trump won all delegates in Florida in the primary -- Barron will have to vote for his father.\n\nIn some states, that would not be the case. While Republican Party rules dictate pledged electors vote for the candidate that fulfilled the criteria for them to be assigned to a candidate, it is not illegal to vote for someone else in some states.\n\nWhile Barron has a familial advantage, most delegates are party workers or former politicians themselves. Barron and his family's position as delegates appears unique in the RNC's history. Donald Trump Jr. previously held a position as a New York delegate in 2016.\n\nTrump's only other significant competition and current second-place spot holder in delegates -- former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley -- dropped out in March.\n\nSome argue that Barron's new position has opened him up for scrutiny by the public.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe Trump campaign told the Washington Examiner that Barron \"has an interest in national politics.\" The 18-year-old is set to graduate high school next week as his father was recently granted a reprieve from appearing in a New York courtroom so he can attend the graduation ceremony.\n\nThe delegate job is the first significant sign of what Barron will do after his high school graduation.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_o_keefe@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Ross O'Keefe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barron's_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barron's (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikki_Haley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikki Haley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wex-s3.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AP24018568356171-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551868", "eventUri": "eng-9551868", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The 18-year-old son of Donald and wife Melania Trump was just chosen to be one of the Florida delegates at the Republican National Convention in July!\n\nBarron, who has largely been kept out of the public eye, will be one of the 41 at-large delegates this summer, when the G.O.P. is expected to officially nominate the former US President as the Republican presidential candidate, NBC News revealed on Wednesday. This will be the teen's first big foray into politics -- and we can only hope he has a less divisive and criminal-riddled run than his dad has had.\n\n\"We have a great delegation of grassroots leaders, elected officials and even Trump family members,\" Florida GOP chairman Evan Power said at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday, per NBC. \"Florida is continuing to have a great convention team, but more importantly we are preparing to win Florida and win it big.\"\n\nBarron's older siblings Eric Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Tiffany Trump will also be in the delegation. Noticeably missing is Donald's daughter Ivanka Trump, despite recent rumors that she is eyeing a return to politics. Eric's wife Lara was made co-chair of the Republican National Committee this year, per The New York Times, and Donald Jr.'s fianc\u00e9e Kimberly Guilfoyle and Tiffany's husband Michael Boulos are also joining the Florida delegation.\n\nDespite the fact that most of the family are involved, it's still a little surprising that Barron is making such a big public display of support for his dad. Especially since he doesn't seem that comfortable around the elder Trump. Body language expert Judi James recently commented on a TikTok video of Barron and Donald together at Mar-a-Lago. \"When Barron is with his father here though signals of some awkwardness increase,\" she told Mirror. This could be partly due to the \"pressure\" Barron feels around his dad.\n\n\"His father's status and power signals as he works the room seem to make Barron keep his distance a little rather than catching up to make his presence felt as he did with his mother,\" she said, adding that sometimes Donald does things that make Barron \"cringe.\"\n\nBarron is also looking to go to college in the fall, which wouldn't leave much time for politics. Only time will tell what he decides to do!", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sydni_ellis@sheknows.com", "name": "Sydni Ellis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Shields", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooke Shields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melania_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melania Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanka_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivanka Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Guilfoyle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Guilfoyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/barron.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551868", "eventUri": "eng-9551868", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

It comes amid reports that Barron's mother, Melania Trump, is granting him more autonomy as he steps into adulthood.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Barron, the youngest child of former President Trump, was chosen by the Republican Party of Florida as one of the state's at-large delegates to the Republican National Convention.\n\nIn the released statement, Florida GOP chairman Evan Power said: \"We have a great delegation of grassroots leaders, elected officials, and even Trump family members. Florida is continuing to have a great convention team, but more importantly, we are preparing to win Florida and win it big.\"\n\nBarron's appointment as a delegate marks his most prominent political role thus far. He has mostly stayed away from the political scene, maintaining a notably more private life than his elder siblings, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., who will also serve as Florida at-large RNC delegates alongside Trump's daughter Tiffany.\n\nThe 18-year-old's name was brought up last month at the commencement of his father's New York criminal trial regarding payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election.\n\nAt the time, the former president's legal team requested that Trump should be allowed to be at Barron's high school graduation on May 17, a request that Judge Juan Merchan approved.\n\nThe Trump family has a strong presence in Florida's RNC delegation. Eric, the delegation's chairman, recently participated in a conference call with party leaders alongside Power, the chairman of the Republican Party of Florida.\n\nApart from Trump's children, Barron, Eric, Donald Jr., and Tiffany, the Florida GOP selected other delegates who have close ties with the former president and his family. These include Michael Boulous, Tiffany Trump's husband, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, Donald Jr.'s fianc\u00e9e.\n\nNotably absent from the list were former White House advisors Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, who have stepped away from politics since Trump's loss in 2020. The couple is reportedly now focusing on raising their children and leading a private life.\n\nInsiders close to the family suggest that Melania is transitioning to a more hands-off approach with her son, Barron.\n\nShe is reportedly granting him greater autonomy as he steps into adulthood while still maintaining a watchful eye amid his father's legal battles and presidential campaign.\n\n\"While he was still a minor she zealously protected him and we knew very little about the details of his daily life,\" a source told the DailyMail.\n\n\"I think he's allowed to make more decisions for himself now. He can invite anyone to dinner he wishes. He's slowly becoming more public,\" the tipster added.\n\nEarlier in 2017, Barron faced unwarranted attention on social media, prompting former first daughter, Chelsea Clinton, to call for his privacy, urging trolls to allow him to enjoy a childhood free from scrutiny.\n\nVery recently, Clinton came to Barron's defense after he turned 18 and was branded \"fair game\" by a former NBC executive who took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a photo of Trump and his youngest son on his birthday.\n\nIn the now-deleted post, Mike Sington wrote, \"Barron Trump turns 18 today. He's fair game now.\"\n\nWhile speaking on \"The View,\" Clinton defended Barron's right to privacy, saying, \"I think he's a private citizen. I feel so strongly that if you are a private citizen, you have an unimpeachable right to privacy, and I think the media should leave him alone.\"\n\nStanding at an impressive 6ft 7in, Barron is said to be a dedicated supporter of his father's 2024 campaign and is now confirmed to follow in his footsteps. However, he reportedly wants to establish his voice and platform in doing so.\n\nPer the insider, Barron, as he matures, enjoys more decision-making freedom, including hosting dinners and engaging with high-profile figures like Iranian-American entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David and garnering praise for his wit, charm, and manners,\n\nBet-David lauded Barron's entertaining anecdotes: \"For an hour and a half, we just watched Barron run dinner with stories and entertainment. Oh my God. Everything.\"\n\nThe businessman went on to describe Barron as \"sharp, funny, sarcastic, tough - not weak\" and a \"freaking stud.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law, was named co-chair of the Republican National Committee in March. Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., Barron's older brothers, have been active on the campaign trail. Both are also on Florida's 41-person delegate list for the convention in Milwaukee, the campaign official said, along with Tiffany Trump, Trump youngest daughter.\n\nIvanka Trump, Trump's older daughter, is the only child of the former president not on the delegate roster.\n\nDelegates are allocated following primary contests in each state. While the rules are complex, delegates are typically assigned to represent a candidate at the convention, where the nominee is officially selected.\n\nGiven Trump's domination of the Republican nominating contest, almost all delegates in Milwaukee will be supporting the former president.\n\nBarron is due to graduate high school on May 17.\n\nThe judge overseeing Trump's criminal trial in New York for covering up a hush money payment to a porn star has allowed the former president to take the day off to attend the graduation ceremony.\n\n(Reporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Michael Erman)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Joe Gruters, a major Trump supporter and DeSantis critic; former state Attorney General Pam Bondi; Florida CFO Jimmy Patronis; and former Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter.\n\nState Sen. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, was named an alternate delegate.\n\nThere was yet another Trump name among the listed delegates, though no apparent relation to the former president.

The position serves as Barron's political debut, and RNC delegates have an important job.\n\nBarron is one of 2,429 delegates who will vote for the Republican nominee at the 2024 RNC in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Donald Trump has already clinched the nomination, and according to a Florida law that dictates delegates follow the primary results -- Trump won all delegates in Florida in the primary -- Barron will have to vote for his father.\n\nIn some states, that would not be the case. While Republican Party rules dictate pledged electors vote for the candidate that fulfilled the criteria for them to be assigned to a candidate, it is not illegal to vote for someone else in some states.\n\nWhile Barron has a familial advantage, most delegates are party workers or former politicians themselves. Barron and his family's position as delegates appears unique in the RNC's history. Donald Trump Jr. previously held a position as a New York delegate in 2016.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nTrump's only other significant competition and current second-place spot holder in delegates -- former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley -- dropped out in March.\n\nSome argue that Barron's new position has opened him up for scrutiny by the public.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThe Trump campaign told the Washington Examiner that Barron \"has an interest in national politics.\" The 18-year-old is set to graduate high school next week as his father was recently granted a reprieve from appearing in a New York courtroom so he can attend the graduation ceremony.\n\nThe delegate job is the first significant sign of what Barron will do after his high school graduation.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

He turned 18 in March.\n\nBarron Trump, who has long been shielded from the public eye, will make his political debut, so to speak, under the glaring national spotlight at the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nThe youngest Trump child was chosen as an at-large delegate by the Florida Republican Party on Wednesday, NBC News first reported. It will be his first political event -- and his first public event -- since turning 18 in March, having appeared silently by his father's side at previous events.\n\nThe Florida delegation at this year's nominating convention in Milwaukee will be over-represented by the Trump family. Others named as delegates include Donald Trump Jr., his fianc\u00e9e Kimberly Guilfoyle, Eric Trump, Tiffany Boulos (n\u00e9e Trump) and her husband, Michael Boulos. Also on the list are prominent Trump allies like Pam Bondi and Sergio Gor.\n\nThe 18-year-old Trump featured as a point of contention in his father's hush money criminal trial last month. Donald Trump falsely accused Judge Juan Merchan of barring the former president from attending his son's high school graduation on May 17. Merchan ultimately decided to adjourn court on that day, but it looks like Trump might forgo his son's graduation ceremony for a campaign event in Minnesota anyway.\n\nAs with much else in Trumpian politics, it's not typical for a candidate's family to be so entwined with the party. In Barron's case, it's unusual for presidential children to be recruited into politics at such a young age, although certainly it's not unprecedented for former presidents' children to follow their parents into national politics.\n\nDonald Trump's dominance in Florida politics, a state he swept in 2016 and 2020, faced an early threat from Gov. Ron DeSantis, who was seen as potentially formidable primary candidate. But that threat dissipated quickly; despite his attacks on Trump, DeSantis' campaign failed to take off in any significant way, and he dropped out before the first Republican primary. Since then, he has made nice with the presumptive GOP nominee and said that he plans to fundraise on his behalf.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_of_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party of Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At-large", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At-large"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimberly_Guilfoyle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kimberly Guilfoyle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Bondi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pam Bondi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eric Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_nominating_convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential nominating convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-05/240509-barron-trump-vl-924a-05b017.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551868", "eventUri": "eng-9551868", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1219, "textEnd": 1225}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Last month the question of whether or not Trump would miss his son's graduation was up in the air because he is required to be in the courtroom in Manhattan for the bogus hush money trial. The Democrat partisan and campaign contributor judge in the case has granted permission for Barron's father to attend the ceremony.\n\nTwo months after graduation, Barron will be in Milwaukee as a member of the Florida delegation to the Republican National Convention. He and his other siblings were nominated as members of the 41 at-large delegation announced by the Republican Party of Florida on Friday.

Donald Trump's youngest child was only 10 when his father was elected president in 2016, and it's generally considered poor form for journalists or politicians to criticize the president's minor children. We can see that Barron is tall -- his father once said the teen was already towering over him at six-foot-seven -- and that's pretty much all we know. But now Barron, who turned 18 in March, has become a topic of political discussion, partly under circumstances outside his control.\n\nUnder New York state law, Donald Trump is required to attend all the proceedings of his hush-money trial. As he left court on day one of his trial, Trump began complaining that Judge Juan Merchan wouldn't let him attend Barron's high-school graduation on May 17.\n\n\"It looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son, who's worked very, very hard, and he is a great student,\" Trump lamented. \"It looks like the judge isn't going to allow me to escape this scam. It's a scam trial.\"\n\nIn reality, Judge Merchan never banned Trump from attending his son's graduation; he merely said on April 16 that he wasn't ready to rule on the defense's request for court to be adjourned on May 17. A short time later, the judge granted Trump's request.\n\nNow we've learned that while Trump played up how much he wanted to be with his son at his graduation, he isn't even spending the full day with Barron. The Minnesota Republican Party announced this week that Trump will headline its annual Lincoln Reagan dinner on May 17:\n\nTrump has time to attend both events. To get specific: The graduation ceremony at Oxbridge Academy, a private school in Palm Beach, starts at 10 a.m. Presumably, the ceremony takes around one to two hours. Trump can have lunch with his son afterward and take a few pictures, but he can't spend too long celebrating since it takes about three and a half hours to fly from southern Florida to St. Paul, Minnesota, and there's a one-hour time difference. So if Trump wants to make it to the 5 p.m. fundraising dinner, he probably needs to leave Florida around 2 or 2:30 p.m. at the latest.\n\nPresumably, Barron will not attend the Friday-evening event with his father, as few 18-year-olds want to celebrate their graduation by hanging out with House Majority Whip Tom Emmer. But Barron is planning to get more involved in politics in the coming months. On Wednesday night, he was selected by the Republican Party of Florida as one of the state's at-large delegates to the Republican National Convention, which will take place in Milwaukee in July.

Donald Trump Jr. serves as executive vice president at the Trump Organization and has morphed into a right-wing pundit since his father's time in the White House, hosting a podcast, \"Triggered,\" in which he derides \"woke\" culture, regularly attacks his father's political foes and repeats Trump's baseless election fraud claims on social media. Eric Trump, who is less bombastic in his support of his father's politics compared to his older brother but regularly appears alongside him at campaign events, is also an executive vice president at the Trump Organization.

Barron, who turned 18 two months ago, is scheduled to graduate from Oxbridge Academy on May 17.\n\nHe will be eligible to cast his first votes in the August primary and in the November election. Before then, he will apparently cast a ballot as an at-large Sunshine State delegate to officially designate his father at the RNC confab as the GOP's presidential nominee for the third time.\n\nBarron, a minor throughout his father's political career, has been kept out of the public arena even as his adult half-siblings have played prominent roles.\n\nDonald Jr. has been a fixture at his father's campaign rallies, Ivanka Kushner and her husband, Jared, were White House advisers and Eric has been politically involved as well while his spouse, Lara, now serves as vice chair of the Republican National Committee.\n\nAnother of Trump daughter, Tiffany, has also become more involved in her father's political life, too, and spoke on his behalf at the Republican convention in 2020.\n\nBarron Trump has been kept out of spotlight by his parents\n\nBut Barron has been guarded by his parents, and thus not a lot is known about the current high school senior at the private school just west of West Palm Beach.\n\nHe is the tallest of his half-brothers and half-sisters, reportedly about 6 feet, 7 inches, which makes him taller than his father at 6'3\".\n\nDonald Trump once noted in a Super Bowl Sunday interview while he was president that Barron enjoyed playing soccer. At the Conservative Political Action Committee, or CPAC, meeting in Orlando in 2022, Trump boasted about what he said was Barron's prowess with technology.\n\n\"I have a young son, Barron. He can make his computer sing,\" according to The Independent.\n\nThis spring, a one-time NBC News official posted a social media comment saying the newly-turned-adult youth was \"fair game\" for media coverage, eliciting sharp blow back, including from former first daughter Chelsea Clinton.\n\n\"I think he's a private citizen,\" said Clinton, who also grew up in the glare of a White House childhood, when asked about the matter during an appearance on the ABC TV network's \"The View\" talk show. \"I feel so strongly that if you are a private citizen, you have an unimpeachable right to privacy, and I think the media should leave him alone.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.palmbeachpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "eu.palmbeachpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Each of the nation's 50 states and several territories send delegates to the convention to officially vote for their presidential candidate, which is expected to be a simple process since there is no viable challenge to Mr Trump.\n\nThe ex-president won 2,037 delegates during the primary campaign, far more than the necessary 1,215 necessary to clinch the nomination. Mr Trump's nearest challenger, his former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, won 97.\n\nMs Haley won just two contests, in Vermont and Washington DC, though she did become the first woman to win a Republican presidential primary. On the other side of the political divide, President Joe Biden is also set to be confirmed as the Democratic nominee for 2024, setting up America's first rematch in a presidential vote for 70 years.\n\nThis time, Mr Trump is juggling his campaigning with legal battles. He faces dozens of charges across four separate cases.\n\nHis first criminal trial is under way in New York City, where he has been charged with falsifying business records - though denies any wrongdoing.\n\nHe has been given special permission by the judge to take time out of court to attend Barron's high-school graduation next week.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news",

into politics at Florida RNC", "body": "The youngest son of former president Donald Trump, Barron, is set to make his first major foray into politics after he was chosen to serve as the delegate for Florida to the Republican National Convention before he has even graduated from high school.\n\nBarron, who only turned 18 in March, was chosen as one of the state's 41 at-large delegates to the national gathering of Republicans in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in mid-July.\n\nHe will be one of the estimated 2,429 delegates who are expected to officially nominate his father as the Republican candidate for the 2024 race.\n\nFlorida GOP chair Evan Power told NBC: 'We have a great delegation of grassroots leaders, elected officials and even Trump family members.\n\n'Florida is continuing to have a great convention team, but more importantly we are preparing to win Florida and win it big.'\n\nBarron has largely been kept out of the public eye, but was brought into the spotlight this week after a judge delayed his father's hush money trial in New York so that he can attend Barron's high school graduation on May 17.\n\nBarron, who only turned 18 in March, (pictured, centre) was chosen as one of the state's 41 at-large delegates to the national gathering of Republicans in Milwaukee\n\nA judge delayed Donald Trump's (pictured) hush money trial in New York so that he can attend Barron's high school graduation on May 17\n\n'It looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son who's worked very, very hard,' a furious Trump had said of New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan at the outset of his trial less than two weeks ago.\n\nRead More REVEALED: New PROOF the anti-Trump prosecutor in hush money trial is a 'true believer' in Leftist 'lawfare'... as Matthew Colangelo is exposed for taking thousands of dollars from Democratic party\n\n'He's a great student and he's very proud of the fact he did so well and was looking forward for years to having his graduation with his mother and father there, and it looks like the judge isn't gong to allow me to escape this scam, it's a scam trial.'\n\nHe raged on his struggling social media platform: 'Who will explain for me, to my wonderful son, Barron, who is a GREAT Student at a fantastic School, that his Dad will likely not be allowed to attend his Graduation Ceremony, something that we have been talking about for years.\n\n'[All] because a seriously Conflicted and Corrupt New York State Judge wants me in Criminal Court on a bogus 'Biden Case' which, according to virtually all Legal Scholars and Pundits, has no merit, and should NEVER have been brought.'\n\nTo the surprise of many, Merchan last Tuesday relented, ruling the Republican presidential candidate could attend - on one condition.\n\n'I don't think May 17 is a problem,' he said, after warning the ex-commander in chief that he had to attend every day of his trial, or face consequences.\n\n18-year-old Barron Trump

of Trump's 2016 campaign\n\nHe ruled the court wouldn't need to sit on that day - Day 20 of a case surrounding Stormy Daniels, the porn star who detailed her relationship with Trump and the alleged

riveting jurors with a detailed and at times graphic account.\n\nTrump, in turn, whispered to his lawyers and shook his head, later having his lawyers ask Merchan to declare a mistrial, arguing the details in Daniels' testimony have 'nothing to do with this case' and were 'extremely prejudicial' against him .\n\nTrump attorney Todd Blanche called it 'the kind of testimony that makes it impossible to come back from,' framing it as a smear campaign as his client attempts a third bid at the White House.\n\nBut prosecutors fought back, arguing Daniels' testimony was needed to establish why Trump wanted to pay to silence her - leading Merchan to reject the mistrial request after offering the conservative some respite with the Barron ruling.\n\nTrump, in turn, whispered to his lawyers

Barron, who only turned 18 in March, was chosen as one of the state's 41 at-large delegates to the national gathering of Republicans in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in mid-July.\n\nHe will be one of the estimated 2,429 delegates who are expected to officially nominate his father as the Republican candidate for the 2024 race. Florida GOP chair Evan Power told NBC: 'We have a great delegation of grassroots leaders, elected officials and even Trump family members. Florida is continuing to have a great convention team, but more importantly we are preparing to win Florida and win it big.'\n\nBarron has largely been kept out of the public eye, but was brought into the spotlight this week after a judge delayed his father's hush money trial in New York so that he can attend Barron's high school graduation on May 17. 'It looks like the judge will not let me go to the graduation of my son who's worked very, very hard,' a furious Trump had said of New York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan at the outset of his trial less than two weeks ago.\n\n'He's a great student and he's very proud of the fact he did so well and was looking forward for years to having his graduation with his mother and father there, and it looks like the judge isn't gong to allow me to escape this scam, it's a scam trial.'\n\nHe raged on his struggling social media platform: 'Who will explain for me, to my wonderful son, Barron, who is a GREAT Student at a fantastic School, that his Dad will likely not be allowed to attend his Graduation Ceremony, something that we have been talking about for years. [All] because a seriously Conflicted and Corrupt New York State Judge wants me in Criminal Court on a bogus 'Biden Case' which, according to virtually all Legal Scholars and Pundits, has no merit, and should NEVER have been brought.'\n\nTo the surprise of many, Merchan last Tuesday relented, ruling the Republican presidential candidate could attend - on one condition. 'I don't think May 17 is a problem,' he said, after warning the ex-commander in chief that he had to attend every day of his trial, or face consequences. He ruled the court wouldn't need to sit on that day - Day 20 of a case surrounding Stormy Daniels, the adult star who detailed her relationship with Trump and the alleged hush payments paid to her in advance of the 2016 election.\n\nWith Trump seated just feet away, the 45-year-old described a sexual encounter the adult actor said they had in 2006 that resulted in her being paid to keep silent during his campaign a decade years later, riveting jurors with a detailed and at times graphic account. Trump, in turn, whispered to his lawyers and shook his head, later having his lawyers ask Merchan to declare a mistrial, arguing the details in Daniels' testimony have 'nothing to do with this case' and were 'extremely prejudicial' against him.\n\nTrump attorney Todd Blanche called it 'the kind of testimony that makes it impossible to come back from,' framing it as a smear campaign as his client attempts a third bid at the White House. But prosecutors fought back, arguing Daniels' testimony was needed to establish why Trump wanted to pay to silence her - leading Merchan to reject the mistrial request after offering the conservative some respite with the Barron ruling.\n\nHe said Daniels may have provided excessive detail, but it fell on the defense to make more objections, with he Trump team later in the day responding by painting Daniels as a woman scorned, motivated by personal grudge and money from her former suitor. 'Am I correct that you hate President Trump?' defense lawyer Susan Necheles asked the actress.. 'Yes,' she admitted.\n\nHer statements are central to the case, as Trump fixer Michael Cohen, paid her $130,000 to keep quiet about what she says was an awkward and unexpected sexual exploit with the candidate in July 2006, in the waning weeks of Trump's 2016 campaign. The alleged encounter happened at a celebrity golf outing in Lake Tahoe, and Trump - pleading not guilty - has maintained his innocence.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The defendant denies the affair and has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nAfter being dragged into his father's trial over the graduation furore, Barron's appearance as a delegate at the RNC is the clearest sign yet that he is finally emerging from the shadows and entering the Trump family spotlight.\n\nSo who is Barron Trump and what do we know about him?\n\nBarron William Trump was born on 20 March 2006 and is Mr Trump's only child with his third wife.\n\nHe was baptised at the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach, Florida - a venue he returned to in January for the funeral of his maternal grandmother, Amalija Knavs.\n\nThe youngest of all of the former president's children, Barron was raised at Trump Tower in Manhattan and attended the affluent borough's Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School.\n\nBarron was still a child when his father won the presidency in November 2016 and entered the White House.\n\nAlthough he did attend his father's inauguration in January 2017, he was largely restrained from public view by his mother, who initially did not join her husband in Washington DC but chose to stay behind in New York so that her son could finish his elementary school year.\n\nThe first lady's protective attitude was more than justified given that, incredibly, he was attacked by The Daily Caller, aged just 11, over his choice of clothes.\n\nA bizarre August 2017 article in the Caller argued that Barron should be \"dressing like he is in the White House\", rather than wearing a harmless red shark T-shirt in public like any other kid his age.\n\nHaving taken his Columbia Grammar classmates on a tour of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Barron was subsequently enrolled in St Andrew's Episcopal School, a private institution in Potomac, Maryland.\n\nThere, he was largely allowed to pursue his education in peace until his father lost the 2020 presidential election, at which point the family relocated to Mr Trump's sprawling Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nBarron then enlisted at the nearby Oxbridge Academy in 2021, the institution from which he will now graduate next week.\n\nLittle else is currently known about the youngest Trump, although he is understood to be fluent in Slovenian thanks to his mother's influence and a keen soccer fan.\n\nHe has been seen wearing an Arsenal shirt and met DC United players when they came to the White House for the annual Easter Egg Roll in April 2017.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Steve Witkoff, Trump's longtime friend and luxury real estate developer, along with Trump ally Sergio Gor are also listed as delegates.\n\nCNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.\n\nNBC News was first to report on Barron Trump's selection.\n\nBefore Donald Trump's hush money criminal trial began, his attorneys had asked for May 17 off so that he could attend Barron's graduation. The judge last month said things were moving quickly enough that he was comfortable having no court that day so Trump could attend the graduation.\n\nThe Republican National Committee will hold its convention in Milwaukee in July. Last month, the RNC asked the Secret Service to keep protesters farther back from the convention than is currently planned.\n\nRNC counsel Todd Steggerda wrote in a letter that the city of Milwaukee's current proposal \"creates an elevated and untenable safety risk to the attending public\" and places demonstrators in a one-block park that \"will force thousands of peaceful attendees and demonstrators ... to be in extremely close, consistent and unavoidable proximity.\"\n\n\"The operational security plan for national special security events, to include the 2024 Republican National Convention, is developed and approved through an executive steering committee made up of representatives from the Secret Service, as well as supporting federal, state, and local agencies,\" said Alexi Worley, spokesperson for the Secret Service, in a statement at the time. \"The operational security plan is based on a variety of thorough security assessments established in coordination with our partners, with the express mission being to ensure the highest level of safety and security for the convention.\"\n\nDonald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has said he will likely announce his running mate around the RNC convention in July and has been floating several names both in public and private.\n\nCNN's Kate Sullivan, Shania Shelton and Daniel Strauss contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

So far the press has been respectful of his minor status and nobody has given him a hard time. However, Politico is reporting that Barron Trump is now an at-large delegate and will be at the July GOP national convention, along with his half-siblings. Great. Welcome to the club. We hope you don't freak the hell out when you find out how you're a member of one of the most hated families on this planet and why. All's fair in love and war and politics is war.\n\nI had hoped, I guess naively, that Barron had some clue who and what his father is and that he would choose to separate himself from all that. Nope. Looks like he's a Trump. And when you're a Trump you're a Trump all the way, from your first lying grift to your last press pool spray.\n\nBarron Trump hasn't graduated high school yet. But he's already headed into the political big leagues.\n\nThe Republican Party of Florida on Wednesday night picked the 18-year-old youngest son of former President Donald Trump as one of the state's at-large delegates to the Republican National Convention, per a copy of the results viewed by POLITICO.\n\nAnd the Daily Mail is reporting that Barron Trump and a pal ran a golf cart into a \"Secret Service kiosk\" whatever that is. Good. So he's a careless asshole like the rest of his family.Fits right in.\n\nAnd - perhaps more ominously for the former President's Democratic opponents - he's also expressed an interest in following in his 77-year-old father's footsteps.\n\n'Barron is handsome, tall - taller even than his father - and very knowledgeable for someone his age. He's also far more politically interested than people realize,' an insider told DailyMail.com.\n\n'I see all the attributes of a future President if he has the appetite for it. And why not? He has the Trump genes.'\n\nYou can hear Melania's voice in the background can't you? \"Eeef yur azzhole fathur can do eet, you can do eet.\" Let's see how this all works out.

Barron, who turned 18 two months ago, is scheduled to graduate from Oxbridge Academy on May 17.\n\nHe will be eligible to cast his first votes in the August primary and in the November election. Before then, he will apparently cast a ballot as an at-large Sunshine State delegate to officially designate his father as the GOP's presidential nominee for the third time at the RNC confab.\n\nBarron, a minor throughout his father's political career has been kept out of the public arena, even as his adult half-siblings have played prominent roles.\n\nDonald Jr. has been a fixture at his father's campaign rallies, Ivanka Kushner and her husband, Jared, were White House advisers and Eric has been politically involved as well while his spouse, Lara, now serves as vicechair of the Republican National Committee.\n\nAnother of Trump's daughter, Tiffany, has also been more involved in her father's political life, too.\n\nBut Barron has been guarded by his parents, and thus not a lot is known about the current high school senior at the private school just west of West Palm Beach.\n\nHe is the tallest of his half-brothers and half-sisters, reportedly about 6 feet, 7 inches, which makes him taller than his father at 6'3\".\n\nDonald Trump once noted in one Super Bowl Sunday interview while he was president that Barron enjoyed playing soccer. At the Conservative Political Action Committee, or CPAC, meeting in Orlando in 2022, Trump boasted about what he said was Barron's prowess with technology. \"I have a young son, Barron. He can make his computer sing,\" according to The Independent.\n\nThis spring, a one-time NBC News official posted a social media comment saying the newly-turned-adult youth is \"fair game,\" eliciting sharp blow back, including from former first daughter Chelsea Clinton.\n\nChelsea Clinton, who also grew up in the glare of a White House childhood, sharply criticized the \"fair game\" comment and other speculation.\n\n\"I think he's a private citizen,\" Clinton said when asked about the matter during an appearance on the ABC TV network's \"The View\" talk show. \"I feel so strongly that if you are a private citizen, you have an unimpeachable right to privacy, and I think the media should leave him alone.\"\n\nAntonio Fins is a politics and business editor at The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY Florida Network.

Additionally, Barron's brother Eric Trump is the delegation chair for the Sunshine State.\n\nMeanwhile, Barron's father Donald Trump Sr. is currently on trial for felony charges stemming from an alleged hush money payment he made to adult film star Stormy Daniels.

It remains to be seen whether he will give a speech at the Republican convention, as his siblings did in 2016 and 2020.\n\nFor the past several years, Barron has been attending a private high school in Florida. His graduation, on May 17, became a point of contention in Trump's hush-money trial in Manhattan because it overlaps with the court schedule.\n\nThe judge in the case initially delayed a decision on whether court would be in session that day, prompting complaints from Trump, but he eventually agreed to allow the day off from court.\n\nThe Florida party's list of delegates further demonstrates the extent to which the Trump family and Trump's supporters have moved to the center of Republican politics. His daughter-in-law, Lara, who is married to Eric Trump, was made co-chair of the Republican National Committee this year.\n\nThe Florida delegation list also includes Kimberly Guilfoyle, the fianc\u00e9e of Donald Trump Jr., and Michael Boulos, Tiffany Trump's husband. Other longtime Trump allies were also chosen, including Isaac Perlmutter, the former Marvel Entertainment chief executive who is a major donor, and the real estate investor Steve Witkoff, a longtime friend of Trump.\n\nNew York Times\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson warned at the Capitol this week that non-US citizens voting in the November elections is a \"clear and present danger,\" proposing federal legislation to stop it. Tennessee's GOP governor recently signed legislation requiring the state to scrutinize its voter rolls for noncitizens. And in four other states, Republicans have helped put measures on the ballot this fall to make sure the only people who vote in elections are American citizens.\n\nBut experts say the Republican spotlight on the issue glosses over two crucial facts: Noncitizen voting is exceedingly rare, and it is already banned in almost all places, including the ones with ballot measures in November.\n\nThat hasn't stopped Republicans from making the issue a frequent talking point. The unfounded threat brings together two issues Republicans believe will drive turnout with their base: illegal immigration and election fraud claims.\n\nCritics warn that attempts to crack down on noncitizen voting could suppress the votes of Latino voters who fear being wrongly accused of illegally casting ballots. They say they could also lead to database mismatches that push legitimate voters off the rolls.\n\nA news conference on Capitol Hill led by Johnson, Republican of Louisiana, on Wednesday was the most visible element of a multifaceted GOP strategy to center concerns about noncitizen voting in the 2024 campaign. Among the states asking voters to add language to their constitutions explicitly banning noncitizens from voting is Wisconsin, a key swing state. Republicans in another battleground, North Carolina, are pressing to do the same.\n\nThe presumptive GOP presidential nominee, former president Donald Trump, has led the push. He has long argued, without evidence, that Democrats allow undocumented immigrants to cast ballots, insisting that the practice hurt his margin of victory in 2016 and helped cost him the White House in 2020.\n\nDemocrats, Trump wrote on Truth Social in December, were \"scrambling\" to register illegal immigrants so they would \"be ready to VOTE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2024.\"\n\nSince January, noncitizen voting has shown up thousands of times in social media posts, podcasts, and other public statements from high-profile right-wing politicians, commentators, and influencers, according to a Washington Post analysis. Republican lawmakers in Congress have mentioned it hundreds of times in the same time period, according to a review of their social media posts and podcasts.\n\nElon Musk, who has increasingly aligned himself with the right since buying Twitter and rebranding it as X, has posted about noncitizen voting at least 20 times this year to his 182 million followers. \"Their preferred term for an illegal immigrant is FDV (Future Dem Voter),\" he wrote in March.\n\nWashington Post\n\nAUSTIN, Texas -- A top former aide to representative Henry Cuellar and a political and business consultant have agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to help the Democrat congressman from Texas launder more than $200,000 in bribes and to assist prosecutors in a federal criminal investigation, according to court documents unsealed this week.\n\nColin Strother, Cuellar's former chief of staff and campaign manager, and Florencia Rendon, a business consultant and former chief of staff for former representative Solomon Ortiz, struck plea deals in March to ensure their cooperation in a US Department of Justice investigation into Cuellar and his wife.\n\nThe Cuellars have been charged with accepting nearly $600,000 in bribes from an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and bank in Mexico, in exchange for advancing the interests of the country and the bank in the United States.\n\nCuellar, 68, has said he and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, 67, are innocent.\n\nIn addition to bribery and conspiracy, the couple face charges including wire fraud conspiracy, acting as agents of foreign principals, and money laundering. If convicted, they face up to decades in prison and forfeiture of any property linked to proceeds from the alleged scheme.\n\nThe plea agreements by Strother, 50, and Rendon, 73, are related to laundering money from Mexico. The agreements were ordered unsealed on Wednesday. Both men agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering. Strother faces up to five years in prison, and Rendon faces up to 20 years.\n\nInvestigators said Rendon and Cuellar were at a conference in Mexico City in 2015 when they hatched a plan to arrange meetings with executives of Mexican banks needing help with transfers of money from Mexican workers and to draft fake contracts for consulting services to be provided by Imelda Cuellar. According to the indictment against the Cuellars, she \"performed little or no legitimate work\" in exchange for payment.\n\nRendon knew the contract was a \"sham consulting contract\" and that the payments of $15,000 per month were made to funnel to Cuellar, the plea agreement said.\n\nRendon would send $11,000 a month to Strother, who would in turn transfer monthly payments to the Cuellars of $10,000. From March 2016 to February 2018, Strother transferred nearly $215,000 to the Cuellars, according to the plea agreement.\n\nAt one point in 2018, Cuellar confronted Strother in a restaurant parking lot about missed payments to his wife, and Strother produced a spreadsheet on his phone to assure him the payments were up to date, the plea deal said.\n\n\"As long as Strother and Rendon tell the truth, we are not worried,\" Cuellar attorney Chris Flood said. \"At the right time the Judge in this case will warn everyone about the credibility of Strother and Rendon if they don't.\"\n\nAttorneys for Strother and Rendon did not immediately return email and telephone messages seeking comment.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [],

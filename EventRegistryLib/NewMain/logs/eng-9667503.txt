The company said Thursday, June 20, 2024 that it's already replaced 95% of the plastic air fillers with paper filler in North America and is working toward complete removal by year's end. (AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)Amazon is shifting from the plastic air pillows used for packaging in North America to recycled paper because it's more environmentally sound, and it says paper just works better. The company said Thursday that it's already replaced 95% of the plastic air pillows with paper filler in North America and is working toward complete removal by year's end. \"We want to ensure that customers receive their items undamaged, while using as little packaging as possible to avoid waste, and prioritizing recyclable materials,\"\u009d Amazon said. It is the company's largest plastic packaging reduction effort in North America to date and will remove almost 15 billion plastic air pillows from use annually. Almost all customer deliveries for Prime Day this year, which happens next month, will contain plastic no air pillows, according to Amazon. The e-commerce giant has faced years of criticism about its use of plastic from environmental groups, including a nonprofit called Oceana, which has been releasing its own reports on Amazon's use of plastic packaging. Matt Littlejohn, senior vice president of strategic initiatives at Oceana, said that Amazon's efforts to reduce plastic packaging is welcome news, but that there's still more that the company can do. \"While this is a significant step forward for the company, Amazon needs to build on this momentum and fulfill its multiyear commitment to transition its North America fulfillment centers away from plastic,\"\u009d Littlejohn said in a prepared statement. \"Then, the company should expand these efforts and also push innovations like reusable packaging to move away from single-use packaging everywhere it sells and ships.\"\u009d Amazon began transition away from plastic air pillows in October at an automated fulfillment center in Ohio. The company said that it was able to test and learn at the center there, which helped it move quickly on transitioning to recycled paper filling. The transition process included changing out machinery and training employees on new systems and machines. Amazon discovered through testing that the paper filler, which is made from 100% recyclable content and is curbside recyclable, offers the same, if not better protection during shipping compared with plastic air pillows, the company said. Christian Garcia, who works at Amazon's fulfillment center in Bakersfield, California, said in a release that the paper filler is easier to work with and that the machinery gives staff more space so that it's easier to pack orders. Ongoing efforts to reduce waste include a campaign to ship items without any additional packaging, the company said. In 2022, 11% of all of Amazon's packages shipped worldwide were without added delivery packaging. Other efforts include piloting new technology with artificial intelligence and robotics company Glacier to use AI-powered robots to automate the sorting of recyclables and collect real-time data on recycling streams for companies. It's also partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy on new materials and recycling programs.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(materials)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Filler (materials)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paper recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pillow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plastic container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceana_(non-profit_group)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oceana (non-profit group)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon rainforest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmentalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusable_packaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reusable packaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disposable product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bakersfield, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bakersfield, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240620080628-667420cf2863b2db9eafc460jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667503", "eventUri": "eng-9667503", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-06-", "textStart": 32, "textEnd": 39}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 291, "textEnd": 298}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 245, "relevance": 1}

The company said that it used 85,916 metric tons of single-use plastic that year, an 11.6% decrease from 2021.\n\nAmazon began transition away from plastic air pillows in October at an automated fulfillment center in Ohio.

In 2022, 11% of all of Amazon's packages shipped worldwide were without added delivery packaging.\n\nOther efforts include piloting new technology with artificial intelligence and robotics company Glacier to use AI-powered robots to automate the sorting of recyclables and collect real-time data on recycling streams for companies.

Now, four years later, Amazon has announced it has effectively phased out plastic air pillows in North America, including in the United States (its largest market), Canada, and Mexico -- markets accounting for more than 70% of Amazon's sales. Oceana's most recent report found that, in 2022, protective packaging, including plastic air pillows, accounted for over one-third of all e-commerce plastic packaging by weight globally. Plastic air pillows are made from the most common form of marine plastic litter in nearshore ocean areas -- plastic film -- which is also the deadliest type of plastic to large marine animals. Plastic film, unlike its paper alternatives, is not curbside recyclable or compostable. According to research by YouGov, 85% of Amazon customers in the U.S. reported being concerned about plastic pollution.\n\n\"While this is a significant step forward for the company, Amazon needs to build on this momentum and fulfill its multiyear commitment to transition its North America fulfillment centers away from plastic. Then, the company should expand these efforts and also push innovations like reusable packaging to move away from single-use packaging everywhere it sells and ships.\n\nAmazon's move away from plastic air pillows in North America follows the company's phasing out of plastic air pillows in Australia, and nearly all single-use plastic packaging (including air pillows) in India and throughout Europe. Last year, the company reported using 11.6% less plastic packaging globally in 2022 compared to the previous year.\n\nOceana is the largest international advocacy organization dedicated solely to ocean conservation. Oceana is rebuilding abundant and biodiverse oceans by winning science-based policies in countries that control one-quarter of the world's wild fish catch. With more than 300 victories that stop overfishing, habitat destruction, oil and plastic pollution, and the killing of threatened species like turtles, whales, and sharks, Oceana's campaigns are delivering results. A restored ocean means that 1 billion people can enjoy a healthy seafood meal every day, forever. Together, we can save the oceans and help feed the world.

It made a similar commitment to remove plastic pillows in Europe in 2022 and to remove single-use plastic packaging in India in 2020.\n\nThe change in North America will save nearly 15 billion plastic air pillows annually -- marking Amazon's largest reduction of plastic in North America to date, according to Pat Lindner, vice president of sustainable packaging at Amazon.\n\nThe shift comes after years of environmental activist groups and employees asking the company to take more action to mitigate its impact on the environment and commit to reducing its plastic use by at least one-third by 2030.\n\nIt also comes shortly after the environmental group Oceana released an April report that found Amazon generated 208 million pounds of plastic packaging waste in the U.S. in 2022, a nearly 10% increase from a year earlier. That quantity -- in the form of plastic air pillows -- could circle the Earth more than 200 times, Oceana said in its report.\n\n\"As one of the biggest retailers on the planet, Amazon is increasingly defining how our goods are packaged,\" Matt Littlejohn, Oceana's senior vice president for strategic initiatives, said in April when the report was released. \"The company can solve its plastic problem on a global basis now and into the future if it commits to do so -- and follows through.\"\n\nAmazon disputed Oceana's report. It said the total metric tons of single-use plastic used across its global operations decreased 11% from 2021 to 2022.\n\nOceana says that decrease is largely due to efforts outside the United States and has criticized Amazon for being slow to integrate the same plastic reduction methods it has used in other places in North America.\n\nLittlejohn said Amazon's reduction of plastic pillows was \"welcome news.\"\n\n\"While this is a significant step forward for the company, Amazon needs to build on this momentum and fulfill its multiyear commitment to transition its North America fulfillment centers away from plastic,\" Littlejohn said in a prepared statement.\n\nAmazon's Lindner said the North American and European markets aren't always the same. There are different regional companies that provide the recyclable paper Amazon will use to replace the plastic air pillows and different considerations for weather conditions. In North America, the packages also have to travel farther, changing the equation for the materials needed to move products around, Lindner said.\n\n\"Our focus, primarily, up to this date, has been on reducing, rightsizing and minimizing packaging,\" Lindner said. \"That was really a high priority for us.\"\n\nNow, he continued, as Amazon has made progress on that goal, it has turned to the next thing: making more of its packaging curbside recyclable.\n\nAmazon pledged in 2019 to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, part of its Climate Pledge. Net zero broadly means reaching a balance between greenhouse gasses going into the climate and those coming out. The company says it's making progress on its climate goals through efforts to electrify its delivery fleet, switch to renewable energy sources and reduce the amount of packaging in its supply chain.\n\nBut some activist groups say those efforts aren't doing enough. Amazon saw a slight drop in greenhouse emissions from 2021 to 2022, according to the most recent data available from the company, but its total footprint remained millions of metric tons larger than at the start of its climate pledge commitment.\n\nAt Amazon's shareholder meeting last month, some investors once again called on the company to set a \"time-bound\" goal to make its packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable. The proposal did not pass; about 24% of shareholders voted in favor.\n\nLindner said reducing plastic is a \"complex process of innovation\" that involves a lot of testing before it can scale the changes to Amazon's entire warehouse network.\n\n\"Our strategy is to make sure we get it right,\" he said. \"Timelines are important, but quality for the customer and ease of use in our facility is of utmost importance. When we get that right, these solutions will be for the long term.\"\n\nTo reduce the amount of plastic, paper and cardboard that goes into keeping its online store running, Amazon operates a Packaging Innovation Lab in Sumner where it tests different iterations of packaging to see how much it can remove without risking product damage. It tried out different types of paper filler in various weather conditions and situations a package might encounter on its journey to a customers' doorstep, Lindner said.\n\nIt also tested the transition from plastic air pillows to filler paper at its first fully automated warehouse in Euclid, Ohio. There, it found that employees liked the change because the paper took up less space and was easy to manipulate inside the package, Lindner said.\n\nAmazon does not disclose the cost of these types of projects, Lindner said.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_rosenblatt@seattletimes.com", "name": "Lauren Rosenblatt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceana_(non-profit_group)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oceana (non-profit group)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pillow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Lindner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erwin Lindner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disposable product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Environmental movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_waste", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Packaging waste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_packaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable packaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euclid, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Euclid, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Recycling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/06142024_TZR_Amazon_Fulfillment_Center-Plastic_tzr_.jpg?d=1020x655", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667503", "eventUri": "eng-9667503", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Now, four years later, Amazon has announced it has effectively phased out plastic air pillows in North America, including in the United States (its largest market), Canada, and Mexico -- markets accounting for more than 70% of Amazon's sales. Oceana's most recent report found that, in 2022, protective packaging, including plastic air pillows, accounted for over one-third of all e-commerce plastic packaging by weight globally. Plastic air pillows are made from the most common form of marine plastic litter in nearshore ocean areas -- plastic film -- which is also the deadliest type of plastic to large marine animals. Plastic film, unlike its paper alternatives, is not curbside recyclable or compostable. According to research by YouGov, 85% of Amazon customers in the U.S. reported being concerned about plastic pollution.\n\n\"While this is a significant step forward for the company, Amazon needs to build on this momentum and fulfill its multiyear commitment to transition its North America fulfillment centers away from plastic. Then, the company should expand these efforts and also push innovations like reusable packaging to move away from single-use packaging everywhere it sells and ships.\"\n\nAmazon's move away from plastic air pillows in North America follows the company's phasing out of plastic air pillows in Australia, and nearly all single-use plastic packaging (including air pillows) in India and throughout Europe.

It's actually making some progress.", "body": "Nearly all Amazon deliveries in North America no longer include plastic air pillows, the e-commerce giant said on TK [date] .\n\nAmazon said the change will avoid some 15 billion air pillows -- the company's largest reduction in plastic packaging to date. Instead, Amazon is using a paper filler made from 100% recycled material that customers can recycle at home as part of a broader effort to eventually eliminate all plastic packaging from North American fulfillment centers. Amazon already met that goal in Europe this year.\n\nThe switch to recycled paper comes as companies and governments are under pressure to phase out single-use plastics that are piling up in landfills and contributing to the climate crisis. The vast majority of plastics are made from oil and gas, can't be recycled, and degrade into tiny particles that leach into the air and environment. Scientists have found those microplastics in human blood along with organs, including the liver, heart, lungs, and most recently, testicles, but the effects on our health are still being studied.\n\nFor years, Oceana, a nonprofit that advocates for protecting oceans, has criticized Amazon's ballooning plastic footprint as the company shipped billions of packages around the world. Matt Littlejohn, Oceana's senior vice president, told Business Insider that eliminating air pillows indicates Amazon is serious about its plastic reduction efforts in North America and welcome news for oceans. Plastic air pillows are made with a film that's commonly found littering marine areas.\n\nOceana recently estimated that Amazon generated more than 94,000 metric tons of plastic packaging waste in the US alone in 2022, a 9.6% increase over the previous year. It's enough to circle the Earth more than 200 times in the form of air pillows, Oceana said.\n\nAmazon disputes Oceana's figures and reported a lower amount of plastic packaging across its global operations in 2022: Nearly 86,000 metric tons, an 11.6% decrease from the previous year.\n\nOceana said its estimates are higher than Amazon's because the company doesn't account for orders sent by third-party sellers. Those independent sellers account for more than 60% of Amazon's sales. Amazon's plastic packaging data reflects orders shipped through its own fulfillment centers -- which some independent sellers opt for -- and through its grocery business. The data isn't broken down by country.\n\n\"The first thing for us is to really test and learn and then scale what we can control within our own facilities,\" Pat Linder, vice president of mechatronics and sustainable packaging at Amazon, told Business Insider. \"That's been our focus.\"\n\nLinder pointed to an Amazon fulfillment center in Cleveland that last year became the first to eliminate plastic delivery packaging and replace it with paper that's curbside recyclable. The effort involved rebuilding existing machines that package products. Additionally, the recyclable paper is better at protecting orders, Linder said.\n\nHe added that Amazon will disclose the impact of these changes on the company's plastic use in its next sustainability report.\n\nThat report will also detail Amazon's broader climate strategy. The company aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 while boosting sales and building more data centers that demand vast amounts of electricity.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022, Amazon's carbon footprint dropped by 0.4%, although it was still higher than in 2019, the first year Amazon reported its emissions.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceana_(non-profit_group)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oceana (non-profit group)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disposable product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(materials)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filler (materials)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paper recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Litter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microplastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Recycling", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/business_insider_articles_888/8077d6cc9cc7792741a26919c5c09412", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667503", "eventUri": "eng-9667503", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

This move is part of Amazon's larger initiative to eliminate plastic delivery packaging from its regional fulfillment centers by the end of the year.\n\nThe primary objective behind this transition is to minimize waste and prioritize using recyclable materials while ensuring that items reach customers undamaged. Amazon's Vice President of Mechatronics and Sustainable Packaging, Pat Lindner, emphasized the importance of this initiative: \"We are working towards full removal in North America by the end of the year and will continue to innovate, test, and scale in order to prioritize curbside recyclable materials.\"\n\nThis effort is Amazon's largest plastic packaging reduction initiative in North America. It is projected to eliminate nearly 15 billion plastic air pillows annually. For Prime Day this year, almost all customer deliveries will be free of plastic air pillows.\n\nThe transition began with the establishment of Amazon's first U.S. automated fulfillment center in Ohio, where the shift from plastic air pillows to paper fillers was tested and implemented. This pilot allowed Amazon to quickly expand the use of paper filler to 95% of its shipments within a year. The company collaborated with suppliers to source paper filler made from 100% recycled content and coordinated the transition across hundreds of fulfillment centers, involving thousands of employees.\n\nTesting conducted by a third-party engineering lab confirmed that paper filler provides equal, if not superior, protection compared to plastic air pillows. Additionally, the paper filler is curbside recyclable, simplifying the recycling process for customers.\n\nAmazon's employees have also welcomed the change. Christian Garcia, a fulfillment associate in Bakersfield, California, expressed his enthusiasm: \"I'm so excited we're changing over to paper. It's not only easier to work with, but the machinery gives us more space so it's easier to pack orders. And I'm proud to be a part of a change that allows customers to recycle at home.\"\n\nThis initiative is part of Amazon's commitment to reducing packaging and increasing recyclability. The company has invested in various programs to ship items without additional packaging, such as the Ships in Product Packaging program. In 2022, 11% of all packages shipped by Amazon globally were delivered without added Amazon delivery packaging.\n\nAmazon is also exploring innovative materials and recycling solutions. Collaborations with the U.S. Department of Energy and Glacier, a San Francisco-based AI and robotics company, aim to develop new materials and automate the sorting of recyclables to reduce landfill waste and enhance the use of recycled materials in packaging.", "source": {"uri": "environmentenergyleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Environment+Energy Leader"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(materials)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Filler (materials)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bakersfield, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bakersfield, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Recycling", "wgt": 22}], "image": "https://www.environmentenergyleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/An-employee-is-engaged-in-operating-machinery-at-a-sustainable-packaging-station-1024x538.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667503", "eventUri": "eng-9667503", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

The change in North America will save nearly 15 billion plastic air pillows annually -- marking Amazon's largest reduction of plastic in North America to date. (Courtesy of Amazon)\n\nAmazon shoppers should expect less plastic in their packages this year.\n\nThe tech and e-commerce giant announced Thursday it was moving away from plastic air pillows -- large tubes of inflated plastic tucked inside a cardboard box to keep items secure -- and replacing them with recyclable filler paper.\n\nAmazon has already swapped 95% of its plastic air pillows for recyclable paper in North America, the company said Thursday, and expects to fully remove the plastic pillows by the end of the year. It made a similar commitment to remove plastic pillows in Europe in 2022 and to remove single-use plastic packaging in India in 2020.\n\nThe change in North America will save nearly 15 billion plastic air pillows annually -- marking Amazon's largest reduction of plastic in North America to date, according to Pat Lindner, vice president of sustainable packaging at Amazon.\n\nThe shift comes after years of environmental activist groups and employees asking the company to take more action to mitigate its impact on the environment and commit to reducing its plastic use by at least one-third by 2030.\n\nIt also comes shortly after the environmental group Oceana released an April report that found Amazon generated 208 million pounds of plastic packaging waste in the U.S. in 2022, a nearly 10% increase from a year earlier. That quantity -- in the form of plastic air pillows -- could circle the Earth more than 200 times, Oceana said in its report.\n\n\"As one of the biggest retailers on the planet, Amazon is increasingly defining how our goods are packaged,\" Matt Littlejohn, Oceana's senior vice president for strategic initiatives, said in April when the report was released. \"The company can solve its plastic problem on a global basis now and into the future if it commits to do so -- and follows through.\"\n\nAmazon disputed Oceana's report. It said the total metric tons of single-use plastic used across its global operations decreased 11% from 2021 to 2022.\n\nOceana says that decrease is largely due to efforts outside the United States and has criticized Amazon for being slow to integrate the same plastic reduction methods it has used in other places in North America.\n\nLittlejohn said Amazon's reduction of plastic pillows was \"welcome news.\"\n\n\"While this is a significant step forward for the company, Amazon needs to build on this momentum and fulfill its multiyear commitment to transition its North America fulfillment centers away from plastic,\" Littlejohn said in a statement.\n\nAmazon's Lindner said the North American and European markets aren't always the same. There are different regional companies that provide the recyclable paper Amazon will use to replace the plastic air pillows and different considerations for weather conditions. In North America, the packages also have to travel farther, changing the equation for the materials needed to move products around, Lindner said.\n\n\"Our focus, primarily, up to this date, has been on reducing, rightsizing and minimizing packaging,\" Lindner said. \"That was really a high priority for us.\"\n\nNow, he continued, as Amazon has made progress on that goal, it has turned to the next thing: making more of its packaging curbside recyclable.\n\nAmazon pledged in 2019 to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, part of its Climate Pledge. Net zero broadly means reaching a balance between greenhouse gasses going into the climate and those coming out. The company says it's making progress on its climate goals through efforts to electrify its delivery fleet, switch to renewable energy sources and reduce the amount of packaging in its supply chain.\n\nBut some activist groups say those efforts aren't doing enough. Amazon saw a slight drop in greenhouse emissions from 2021 to 2022, according to the most recent data available from the company, but its total footprint remained millions of metric tons larger than at the start of its climate pledge commitment.\n\nAt Amazon's shareholder meeting last month, some investors once again called on the company to set a \"time-bound\" goal to make its packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable. The proposal did not pass; about 24% of shareholders voted in favor.\n\nLindner said reducing plastic is a \"complex process of innovation\" that involves a lot of testing before it can scale the changes to Amazon's entire warehouse network.\n\n\"Our strategy is to make sure we get it right,\" he said. \"Timelines are important, but quality for the customer and ease of use in our facility is of utmost importance. When we get that right, these solutions will be for the long term.\"\n\nTo reduce the amount of plastic, paper and cardboard that goes into keeping its online store running, Amazon operates a Packaging Innovation Lab in Sumner where it tests different iterations of packaging to see how much it can remove without risking product damage. It tried out different types of paper filler in various weather conditions and situations a package might encounter on its journey to a customers' doorstep, Lindner said.\n\nIt also tested the transition from plastic air pillows to filler paper at its first fully automated warehouse in Euclid, Ohio. There, it found that employees liked the change because the paper took up less space and was easy to manipulate inside the package, Lindner said.\n\nAmazon does not disclose the cost of these types of projects, Lindner said.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceana_(non-profit_group)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oceana (non-profit group)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pillow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Lindner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Erwin Lindner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disposable product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Environmental movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_packaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable packaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_waste", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Packaging waste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electrification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euclid, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Euclid, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Recycling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/yakimaherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/df/ddf28e10-8307-55a0-a49f-ad5f466f0d6e/66744a77ac658.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667503", "eventUri": "eng-9667503", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

It's also partnering with the U.S. Department of Energy on new materials and recycling programs.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A full switch is planned by the 2024 holiday retail season.\n\nThe move, announced June 20, will cut an estimated 15 billion of these cushions annually and follows a similar elimination process in Europe in the summer of 2022. Approximately 40 percent of Amazon orders are shipped in these boxes. The Seattle-based retailer has cut 37,150 tons of plastic packaging since 2020, but it still used 85,916 tons of single-use plastic in 2022.\n\nEliminating the pillows represents Amazon's biggest plastic reduction yet. Amazon is phasing out single-use plastics across its worldwide delivery network. The company eliminated extra packaging completely by shipping about 11 percent of items in their original boxes. It is also switching from plastic to paper envelopes, a process that began earlier this year.\n\n\"Wherever we can, we use recycled content. But sometimes automation technologies make that more challenging,\" said Pat Lindner, vice president of mechatronics and sustainable packaging at Amazon.\n\nEven if you can collect them, used air pillows are difficult to recycle because they often jam sorters. \"Most air pillows do not have effective recycling programs, even if you take the time to pop them one by one,\" said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, and a former Environment Protection Agency administrator. \"Paper and other fiber products are suitable alternatives.\"\n\nAn estimated 460 million metric tons of plastic were produced last year, and at least one-third went into packaging, according to data cited by the Plastic Pollution Coalition (PPC).\n\nBiodegradable products can be discarded more easily. Paper (recycled or otherwise) or algae- and mushroom-derived fillers are better for cushioning items, said Erica Cirino, communications manager at the PPC.\n\nAside from being eligible for curbside recycling, paper absorbs drops and other stresses more effectively than pillows, said Clint Haynes, vice president and partner with Stress Engineering, which helped Amazon replace the air pillows. They fill \"crumple zones\" and absorb energy from impacts, rather than allowing them to bounce around.\n\nThe way packages are shipped has changed little since the 1970s, said Haynes. \"If you're a believer in where e-commerce is going to go, you need to start rethinking the fundamentals of your packaging programs,\" he said.\n\nAmazon tested the changes in an innovation center near its Seattle headquarters and at its fulfillment center in Cleveland, the first to switch from plastic to paper mailing envelopes in late 2023. The company replaced the feeders for the plastic air pillows, which were leased, with canisters that dispense the paper. The testing costs came from Amazon's innovation budget, but upgrades were part of regular capital expenditures across its facilities, Lindner said.\n\nAmong the factors Amazon evaluated were how long it takes to fill and seal a package (the new process is quicker) and the ergonomics associated with the process, including the height of the dispensers (which can be adjusted for individuals), Lindner said. The new process gives employees \"more flexibility to protect ... and allows them to be more thoughtful,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "greenbiz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GreenBiz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disposable product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pillow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plastic container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paper recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_Pollution_Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plastic Pollution Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Envelope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_packaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable packaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mechatronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodegradation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biodegradation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_cushioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Package cushioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(materials)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filler (materials)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.greenbiz.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_1200x630/public/2024-06/AMZN%20Air%20Pillow%20Removal%205.jpg?itok=IgBFpmU2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667503", "eventUri": "eng-9667503", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 311, "textEnd": 318}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

To date, this will be Amazon's largest plastic packaging reduction effort in North America and will avoid nearly 15 billion plastic air pillows annually.\n\nAccording to Amazon, nearly all customer deliveries during Prime Day 2024 will not contain plastic air pillows.\n\nThrough testing of paper filler, which Amazon says included an assessment by a third-party engineer lab, the e-tailer discovered that it offers the same, if not better, protection to products than plastic air pillows. The paper filler is also curbside recyclable, making it easier for customers to recycle at home, and is made from 100% percent recycled content.\n\nAmazon focuses on packaging sustainability\n\nAmazon continues looking for ways to minimize carbon emissions, increase recyclability and reduce waste in its packaging. The company follows a number of initiatives to reduce packaging, particularly plastic packaging.\n\nThese include the \"Ships in Product Packaging\" (SIPP) program made available to all third-party sellers across the U.S. and Canada using the Fulfillment by Amazon hosted logistics service .\n\nThe program is designed to reduce unnecessary packaging waste by testing packages for their ability to ship in the original manufacturer's packaging without additional Amazon packaging.\n\nSince 2015, the company says packaging programs like SIPP have reduced its average packaging per shipment by 41% and eliminated the need for more than 2 million tons of packaging material. In 2022, 11% of packages Amazon shipped worldwide were shipped without additional packaging.\n\nIn addition, the Package Decision Engine, an AI model that Amazon designed and built, is able to determine the most efficient type of packaging for each item it learns about. Amazon then uses this information to help reduce the number of cardboard boxes, air pillows, tape and mailers used to send purchases to customers.", "source": {"uri": "chainstoreage.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chain Store Age"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pillow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(materials)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Filler (materials)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_shopping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online shopping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_waste", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Packaging waste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardboard_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardboard box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://assets1.chainstoreage.com/s3fs-public/styles/primary_articles_short/public/2024-06/amazon-packaging.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667503", "eventUri": "eng-9667503", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

It actually turned out to perform better -- and can help reduce the number of packages that get damaged in shipment. Amazon worked with suppliers to find a lightweight, 100% recycled paper that's easier to crumple around an object to protect it. The paper also takes up less space, so now more items fit in a smaller box. (Amazon also uses AI and machine learning to try to get items into the smallest possible package.) That translates to using less gas -- or electricity, in the case of the company's electric vans -- to make a delivery, since more packages can fit in a truck.\n\nAmazon piloted the paper filler first at a warehouse near Cleveland, installing rolls that workers tear off to the right length to fit each item in a box. (Part of the testing involved making sure that paper cuts wouldn't be a problem.) Now, 95% of all deliveries in North America use the paper filler instead of plastic. By the end of the year, every package will, as one step toward a goal to get rid of all plastic delivery packaging.

Log in.\n\nThe switch to recycled paper comes as companies and governments are under pressure to phase out single-use plastics that are piling up in landfills and contributing to the climate crisis. The vast majority of plastics are made from oil and gas, can't be recycled, and degrade into tiny particles that leach into the air and environment. Scientists have found those microplastics in human blood along with organs, including the liver, heart, lungs, and most recently, testicles, but the effects on our health are still being studied.\n\nFor years, Oceana, a nonprofit that advocates for protecting oceans, has criticized Amazon's ballooning plastic footprint as the company shipped billions of packages around the world. Matt Littlejohn, Oceana's senior vice president, told Business Insider that eliminating air pillows indicates Amazon is serious about its plastic reduction efforts in North America and welcome news for oceans. Plastic air pillows are made with a film that's commonly found littering marine areas.\n\nOceana recently estimated that Amazon generated more than 94,000 metric tons of plastic packaging waste in the US alone in 2022, a 9.6% increase over the previous year. It's enough to circle the Earth more than 200 times in the form of air pillows, Oceana said.\n\nAmazon disputes Oceana's figures and reported a lower amount of plastic packaging across its global operations in 2022: Nearly 86,000 metric tons, an 11.6% decrease from the previous year.\n\nOceana said its estimates are higher than Amazon's because the company doesn't account for orders sent by third-party sellers. Those independent sellers account for more than 60% of Amazon's sales. Amazon's plastic packaging data reflects orders shipped through its own fulfillment centers -- which some independent sellers opt for -- and through its grocery business. The data isn't broken down by country.\n\n\"The first thing for us is to really test and learn and then scale what we can control within our own facilities,\" Pat Linder, vice president of mechatronics and sustainable packaging at Amazon, told Business Insider. \"That's been our focus.\"\n\nLinder pointed to an Amazon fulfillment center in Cleveland that last year became the first to eliminate plastic delivery packaging and replace it with paper that's curbside recyclable. The effort involved rebuilding existing machines that package products. Additionally, the recyclable paper is better at protecting orders, Linder said.\n\nHe added that Amazon will disclose the impact of these changes on the company's plastic use in its next sustainability report.\n\nThat report will also detail Amazon's broader climate strategy. The company aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 while boosting sales and building more data centers that demand vast amounts of electricity.\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022, Amazon's carbon footprint dropped by 0.4%, although it was still higher than in 2019, the first year Amazon reported its emissions.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "catherine_boudreau@businessinsider.com", "name": "Catherine Boudreau", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceana_(non-profit_group)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oceana (non-profit group)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaching_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leaching (chemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disposable product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microplastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microplastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paper recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_waste", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Packaging waste"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Litter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/667365c0087acd2be9b4efb7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667503", "eventUri": "eng-9667503", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The aim is to reduce the packaging and ensure that customers receive their items undamaged. On Oct 18, 2023, Amazon announced its first U.S. automated fulfillment center in Ohio to eliminate plastic delivery packaging.\n\nAmazon promotes sustainability by transitioning from plastic to paper filler.\n\nAmazon, on Thursday, announced its largest reduction in plastic packaging in North America to date. The aim is to reduce the packaging and ensure that customers receive their items undamaged, while still promoting sustainability.\n\nAccording to the report, the company aims to remove 95% of their plastic air pillows as a way to reduce packaging and as part of its multi-year effort to remove plastic delivery packaging from North America fulfillment centers.\n\nPat Lindner, VP of Mechatronics and Sustainable Packaging, said in a comment that the plastic packaging reduction is an example of how they provide new solutions to protect their customers, and they are working towards full removal in North America by the end of the year.\n\n\"I'm proud of the cross-Amazon collaboration to make a positive impact on the customer delivery experience with easier to recycle materials. It's a great example of how we thoughtfully test and scale new solutions to protect our customer experience. We are working towards full removal in North America by end of year and will continue to innovate, test, and scale in order to prioritize curbside recyclable materials.\" Pat said.\n\nChristian Garcia, fulfillment Associate at our BFL1 fulfillment center in Bakersfield, California said, \"We've found that our teammates in our fulfillment centers love it, too. I'm so excited we're changing over to paper. It's not only easier to work with, but the machinery gives us more space so it's easier to pack orders. And I'm proud to be a part of a change that allows customers to recycle at home.\"\n\nWhen did it all start?\n\nOn Oct 18, 2023, Amazon announced its first U.S. automated fulfillment center in Ohio to eliminate plastic delivery packaging. According to the report, with the work in Ohio and continuous testing, they changed from plastic air pillows to paper filler.\n\nPat Lindner, VP of Mechatronics and Sustainable Packaging at Amazon, said, \"This is a major milestone for our U.S. fulfillment centers, and I'm incredibly proud of the teams that developed new technologies to eliminate plastic packaging. This is just the beginning, as we continue to discover more ways to eliminate and reduce plastic packaging for our customers.\"\n\nAccording to the release, to create a solution that was lighter, smaller, and curbside recyclable, Amazon packaging engineers redesigned machines that use a built-in sensor to identify the correct size for non-padded paper packaging of products like clothes, kitchen supplies, and sports equipment.\n\nAmazon's substantial decrease in plastic packaging represents a commendable stride towards sustainability in North America. By emphasizing eco-friendly alternatives and minimizing waste, Amazon not only sets a commendable precedent but also fulfills the rising consumer expectation for environmentally conscious practices. This effort not only contributes positively to the environment but also bolsters Amazon's brand reputation as a pioneer in corporate sustainability initiatives.\n\nRelated Items:Amazon, ecommerce, North America Recommended for you Microsoft And Amazon To Collaborate On $16.4 Billion AI Investment In India Mallconomy To Offer Metaverse Shopping Experience Users Can Browse on Any Device Samsung Hires Ex Executive To Head North American AI", "source": {"uri": "techbullion.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechBullion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angela_scott_briggs@techbullion.com", "name": "Angela Scott-Briggs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "sandy_wincefort@techbullion.com", "name": "Sandy Wincefort", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_container", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic container"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mechatronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bakersfield, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bakersfield, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Packaging engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://techbullion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Amazon-Logo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667503", "eventUri": "eng-9667503", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 257, "textEnd": 263, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Amazon does not make its own paper filler; instead, it purchases it from third-party suppliers.\n\nThe company tested the approach in an Ohio fulfillment center, and in October, announced that facility was its first U.S. location to eliminate plastic packaging entirely. Since seeing success there with the paper filler, the company has employed that approach in its other North American facilities.\n\nTo do so, the company said, it had to change out some of its machinery and re-train employees on the new systems and machines it implemented to make the plastic reduction a possibility.\n\nChristian Garcia, a fulfillment associate at an Amazon facility in Bakersfield, Calif., said the experience of switching to paper-based packaging has been positive for him and other employees.\n\n\"I'm so excited we're changing over to paper. It's not only easier to work with, but the machinery gives us more space so it's easier to pack orders. And I'm proud to be a part of a change that allows customers to recycle at home,\" Garcia said in a statement.\n\nThis initiative, which the company said marks its largest-ever reduction in plastic-based materials in North America, is not the only way the company continues to decrease its plastic usage, particularly in packaging.\n\nEarlier this year, the company announced that its Climate Pledge Fund had invested in Glacier, a startup using AI and robotics to ease the burden of recycling. The Prime purveyor has been working with the company to find ways it can salvage previously unrecyclable materials and purify its waste streams.\n\nIn 2022, Amazon announced it had partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy on a plastic waste reduction project, in which it has worked with the agency on chemical upcycling.\n\nBut despite its progress, Amazon still has a ways to go when it comes to decreasing its use of plastics. According to Oceana research from earlier this year, Amazon generated 208 million pounds' worth of mailers, bubble wrap and shrink film in the United States alone. The non-profit alleged that consumers in the U.S. have been left behind when it comes to plastics progress, despite being Amazon's largest market.\n\nAt the time the report came out, Pat Lindner, vice president of mechatronics and sustainable packaging at Amazon, said Oceana's numbers were incorrect and overblown.\n\nUpon Amazon's latest announcement around North American plastic reduction, Lindner said further innovation is at the forefront of Amazon's future strategy.\n\n\"I'm proud of the cross-Amazon collaboration to make a positive impact on the customer delivery experience with easier to recycle materials. It's a great example of how we thoughtfully test and scale new solutions to protect our customer experience,\" Lindner said in a statement. \"We are working towards full removal in North America by end of year and will continue to innovate, test and scale in order to prioritize curbside recyclable materials.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "meghan_hall@yahoo.com", "name": "Meghan Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(materials)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Filler (materials)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penske_Media_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penske Media Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakersfield,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bakersfield, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bakersfield, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceana_(non-profit_group)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oceana (non-profit group)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_packaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable packaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plastic pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upcycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upcycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrink_wrap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shrink wrap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mechatronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Environment/Waste Management", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Polymers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution_Prevention_and_Recycling", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Pollution Prevention and Recycling", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/sourcing_journal_735/e30430c393f27a0a57a02b61486acf12", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667503", "eventUri": "eng-9667503", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Instead of using plastic air pillows as packing filler, the company is opting for 100% recycled paper.\n\nAmazon began testing recycled paper filler at an Ohio fulfillment center last year. The paper filler was found to offer the same protection as plastic air pillows. Use of paper filler also cleared up space in the Ohio fulfillment center and proved to be \"easier to work with,\" according to an employee quoted in Amazon's press release.\n\nThere's also an obvious environmental benefit to paper filler. Amazon expects to cut its use of air pillows by 95%, effectively removing 15 billion plastic air pillows from the supply chain. The new paper filler, which is 100% recycled, should have a reduced environmental even if it isn't recycled by the customer. Of course, customers will also appreciate the fact that they don't need to pop a bunch of air pillows every time they receive a large delivery.\n\nI should note that Amazon's \"discoveries\" aren't really all that groundbreaking. Distributors already know that paper filler can offer the same protection as plastic air pillows. They also know that paper is less cumbersome for employees -- instead of teaching a rotating cast of laborers how to use an air cushion machine, you can just tell them to stick some paper in a box (although employees still need to be taught how to use an appropriate amount of paper).\n\nAir pillows are commonly used in packaging because they are the most economical \"void fill\" solution for large-scale distribution operations. Amazon hasn't commented on the economic side of things, so we don't know whether this transition is economically or environmentally motivated.\n\nPersonally, I hope that Amazon has found a way to make paper filler the more profitable packaging option. It would give other distributors a reason to follow suit.\n\nThis year's Prime Day is scheduled for July 2024. An exact date for the shopping event has yet to be announced. You should notice the switch to paper filler during this year's Prime Day, although the use of paper filling may vary between distribution centers.\n\nSource: Amazon", "source": {"uri": "howtogeek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The How-To Geek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filler_(materials)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Filler (materials)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paper recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pillow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packaging_and_labeling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Packaging and labeling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hovercraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hovercraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Distribution center"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Pulp_and_Paper", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Pulp and Paper", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Paper", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Paper", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Paper", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Paper", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/53008718875_d475eceb04_o.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667503", "eventUri": "eng-9667503", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

With Amazon set to eliminate its plastic air pillows, Kinetic Automation launching a new robotic system, new comments from TikTok about the U.S. ban, and more, there's much to catch up on. So, let's get started!\n\nOn June 20, Amazon announced that it has eliminated 95% of plastic air pillows from its packaging in North America, replacing them with paper fillers made from 100% recycled content. This initiative represents Amazon's most significant effort to reduce plastic packaging and will eliminate nearly 15 billion plastic pillows annually.\n\n\"We aim to completely eliminate plastic air pillows in North America by the end of the year and will continue to innovate, test, and scale up the use of curbside recyclable materials,\" said Pat Lindner, VP of Mechatronics and Sustainable Packaging, in the announcement.\n\nKinetic Automation, which has about 40 full-time employees, has created a robotic system that leverages computer vision and machine learning software to quickly identify issues with a vehicle's digital systems.\n\nKinetic CEO and co-founder Nikhil Naikal noted that many new tech models, particularly battery electric vehicles, are equipped with numerous advanced features such as touchscreens, sophisticated infotainment software, and various cameras and sensors. These technologies support functionalities ranging from rapid charging to driver safety features like forward collision avoidance, lane-keeping, and adaptive cruise control.\n\nOn June 20, TikTok and ByteDance requested that a U.S. court overturn a law set to ban the popular short video app in the United States on Jan. 19. They claim the U.S. government has not engaged in any serious settlement discussions since 2022.\n\nThe legislation, signed by President Joe Biden in April, requires ByteDance to divest TikTok's U.S. assets by January 19 next year or face a tech ban on the app, which is used by 170 million Americans. ByteDance asserts that such a divestiture is \"not possible technologically, commercially, or legally.\"\n\nOracle announced that it will invest over $1 billion in artificial intelligence and cloud computing in Spain over the next 10 years, aiming to meet the growing demand for its services in the country.\n\nThe investment will fund the establishment of a new cloud region, enabling customers to transfer workloads from their data centers to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. This initiative will also assist clients in complying with regulations such as the European Union's Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and the European Outsourcing Guidelines.\n\nAnthropic, a startup backed by Google and Amazon, announced the release of an updated artificial intelligence model and a new layout designed to enhance user productivity, continuing the industry's rapid advancement in tech. Just three months after introducing its Claude 3 family of AI models, Anthropic is now launching Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n\nThis new system outperforms Claude 3 Opus, which CEO Dario Amodei described in March as the \"Rolls-Royce of models.\" Claude 3.5 Sonnet scores higher on benchmark exams, operates at about twice the speed and is priced for software developers at one-fifth the cost.", "source":

The nonprofit ocean conservation group released a study in 2021 showing that Amazon produced 599 million pounds of plastic waste in 2020.

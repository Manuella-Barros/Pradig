Instead, they proceeded to announce the results,\u201d Uday Kanth told Deccan Chronicle.The advocate mentioned that 67 students had achieved the perfect score of 720/720, which was highly unusual and unprecedented. At an examination centre at Haryana, six students scored 720 marks, and two others 718.\u201cSuch clustering of high scores at a single centre is highly improbable and raises suspicions of malpractice. Several students scored 718 and 719 marks, which is statistically improbable in the NEET format,\u201d he said. \u201cThe explanation provided by the NTA regarding these scores is unsatisfactory and lacks transparency.\u201dHe also said allegations that grace marks were awarded due to time wastage during the exam. This provision was not disclosed in the information brochure, preventing all students from utilising this provision under similar circumstances.\u201cThe results were declared prematurely on a day when the media was preoccupied with the general election results. This sudden urgency by the NTA raises further suspicion,\u201d Uday Kanth stated.Uday Kanth alleged that the cutoff had been set at an unprecedented and illogical increase. The All India Rank (AIR) at the same score has increased three to four times compared to NEET-2023, which is unjustifiable.Uday Kanth said that counselling should not be held until the exam process and results are investigated. Students who received grace marks should be scrutinised, and a re-examination should be scheduled only for them, as the normalisation formula used for giving grace marks was unfair and unprecedented in NEET history, he said.He demanded strict punishment for students who used unfair means to pass the exam.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/southern-states/telangana/vice-chairman-for-tpcc-rti-department-urges-cbi-probe-into-neet-2024-scam-898012", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/08/1095771-seniorhcadvocateudaykanth.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:16:18", "author": "Syed Omar Farooq", "authors": ["Syed Omar Farooq"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.369}

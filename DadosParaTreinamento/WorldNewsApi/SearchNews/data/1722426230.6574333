{"id": 243325926, "title": "Former Hearts star suffers 'accident' at home after Premiership transfer to leave him injured for months", "text": "Craig Levein has confirmed former Hearts striker Uche Ikpeazu will be out of action for months at St Johnstone, just weeks after his transfer to Perth. The forward was last with Port Vale in England, reuniting with the man who managed him at Hearts earlier this summer. However, Ikpeazu has suffered an accident at home and it has caused damage to his knee, ruling him out until September or possibly October. Levein has told Saints TV of the incident but admitted it\u2019s an occurrence that happens from time to time. He said: \u201cUche had an accident at home and twisted his knee, so he\u2019s damaged his cartilage a little bit. He\u2019s had to have an operation. \u201cThese things usually take three to four months, which is a real blow to us. He\u2019s three or four weeks into that now, so we\u2019ll see him September into October. Uche is frustrated, he was desperate to get started. \u201cIt was an accident, one of those things. We will be glad to get him back, he\u2019s physical, quick and is good at holding the ball in. We have all different types of strikers, but not really anyone who we can go direct to if we need to. \u201cHe brings that. Obviously I\u2019m very disappointed he\u2019s not going to get the chance to show what he can do from the first match. But that\u2019s football and sometimes you have to accept accidents happen and you have to wait.\u201d Ikpeazu joined Hearts in 2018 and left in 2020. During his time at Tynecastle, he netted 10 goals with nine assists in 55 matches.", "summary": "<p>The former Hearts striker made a Premiership transfer move this summer.</p>", "url": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport/football/hearts/former-hearts-star-accident-after-premiership-transfer-injured-for-months-4683012", "image": "https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/jpim-static/2024/06/28/8/07/19574031-1.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:49:24", "author": "Ben Banks", "authors": ["Ben Banks"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.336}

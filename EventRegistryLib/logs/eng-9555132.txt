The clips were deepfakes.\n\nAn incident in the U.S. involved robocalls impersonating President Joe Biden that urged voters in New Hampshire to abstain from voting in January\u00b4s primary election. The robocalls were later traced to a political consultant who said he was trying to publicize the dangers of AI deepfakes.\n\nAI technology is a challenge to law enforcement not only because it lowers the barrier of entry for people looking to make mischief but also because it adds to the arsenal of more sophisticated foreign governments that want to interfere in elections, said the official, who was one of several FBI officials to brief reporters on the topic of election security on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the FBI.\n\nThe three countries of most concern to the FBI in the current election year are Russia, Iran and China. Officials in the past have ascribed different motives and ambitions to the countries in terms of what they hope to achieve by influencing American elections.\n\nFILE - An FBI seal is seen on a wall on Aug. 10, 2022, in Omaha, Neb.

And it said that Iran conducted covert operations aimed at exploiting perceived social divisions.\n\nIn 2024, FBI officials said, China will likely continue its efforts to sow divisions, and the FBI is watching whether the Ukraine war will motivate Russia's behavior.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This warning comes amidst the increasing prevalence of AI-generated deepfakes and robocalls, which have already made their mark in political arenas. A senior official highlighted the growth of such technology as a significant area of concern for the coming years.\n\nOne notable instance illustrating this threat occurred in Slovakia, where deepfake audio clips mimicking the voice of a liberal party leader discussing controversial topics were circulated on social media right before parliamentary elections. Similarly, in the United States, robocalls impersonating President Joe Biden were used to dissuade voters in New Hampshire from participating in January's primary election. These incidents underscore the challenges AI technology poses to election security and the ease with which individuals can engage in deceptive practices.\n\nThe FBI's focus is not only on the mischief-makers but also on sophisticated foreign governments aiming to meddle in U.S. elections. Russia, Iran, and China are identified as the primary countries of concern. Each has previously engaged in efforts to influence American electoral outcomes, albeit with varying motives and methods. For instance, Russia's preference for certain candidates and its hack-and-leak operations have been well-documented, while China has been reported to target races involving candidates with anti-China stances.\n\nAn intelligence community report shed light on Russia's attempts to disparage the Democratic Party during the 2022 midterm elections, aiming to erode U.S. support for Ukraine and undermine election confidence. Meanwhile, China's focus has been on covertly undermining a U.S. senator among other candidates, and Iran has sought to exploit social divisions through covert operations.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, the FBI anticipates that China will likely persist in its efforts to fuel divisions within the U.S., and there is speculation on whether the ongoing Ukraine war will influence Russia's actions.

Nielsen returns to reprise her role from the first film. Pedro Pascal, whose casting was exclusively broken by Deadline, will play General Marcus Acacius. Joseph Quinn appears as Emperor Geta and Fred Hechinger plays Emperor Caracalla. Denzel Washington plays a powerbroker named Macrinus, according to Vanity Fair. Lior Raz and Derek Jacobi will also star.\n\nWhat is Gladiator II about?\n\nGrown-up Lucius (Paul Mescal) resides peacefully with his family in Numidia, but General Marcus Acacius' (Pedro Pascal) invasion of the city forces Lucius into slavery. Inspired by Russel Crowe's Maximus, Lucius decides to become a gladiator and challenge the rule of Emperors Caracalla (Fred Hechinger) and Geta (Joseph Quinn).\n\nAfter Lucius' first encounter with Acacius in Numidia, the warrior returns to Rome as a gladiator to see that his mother is in love with Acacius, as revealed in Vanity Fair.\n\nPascal also told VF that he nicknamed Mescal \"Brick Wall Paul\" in light of their fight scenes.\n\nRELATED: 'Gladiator 2' Star Paul Mescal Says He Was \"Too Afraid\" To Talk To Pedro Pascal & Why Sequel Film Has Him \"Stressed\"\n\nHow does Gladiator II connect to Gladiator?\n\nMescal's Lucius, son of Connie Nielsen's Lucilla, appeared as a child in Gladiator (2000). Lucius is the nephew of the late Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who murdered his father Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to take the throne in the first Gladiator(2000). Lucius is also Marcus Aurelius' (Richard Harris) grandson.\n\nMaximus (Russell Crowe) faced Commodus in the gladiator ring in the first film, and though Commodus fatally wounded Maximus, he managed to skewer the emperor before he died, fading into the great beyond to reunite with his slain wife and son. Maximus saved the boy and his mother while avenging his own family, and left a strong impression on the young Lucius, who was co-emperor of Rome alongside Commodus. Lucilla sent her son away to Numidia in between the first and second films, but he doesn't understand why, and thus there is a rift between the two 20 years later when the second film takes place.\n\nWho is behind Gladiator II?\n\nIn addition to directing, Scott Scott produces with Michael Pruss, Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher off David Scarpa's screenplay. Paramount will distribute the film.\n\nRELATED: 'Wicked' Shifts Earlier In November, Dates Against 'Gladiator II': Is Another 'Barbenheimer' Box Office Weekend In Store?\n\nIs there a trailer for Gladiator II?\n\nYes, the trailer arrived July 9, and it showcases some epic water battles inside the Roman Colosseum.

Wicked was previously set to compete with Moana 2 the weekend after Thanksgiving.\n\nBoth Mescal and Pedro Pascal have made comments about their preparation for the upcoming film, in which their characters fight each other.\n\nRELATED: Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator II' Movie Poster and Images: Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, Denzel Washington, Joseph Quinn & Connie Nielsen\n\nWho is in Gladiator II?\n\nPaul Mescal will star as the main character Lucius, son of Lucilla Connie Nielsen). Nielsen returns to reprise her role from the first film. Pedro Pascal, whose casting was exclusively broken by Deadline, will play General Marcus Acacius. Joseph Quinn appears as Emperor Geta and Fred Hechinger plays Emperor Caracalla. Denzel Washington plays a powerbroker named Macrinus, according to Vanity Fair. Lior Raz and Derek Jacobi will also star.\n\nWhat is Gladiator II about?\n\nGrown-up Lucius (Paul Mescal) resides peacefully with his family in Numidia, but General Marcus Acacius' (Pedro Pascal) invasion of the city forces Lucius into slavery. Inspired by Russel Crowe's Maximus, Lucius decides to become a gladiator and challenge the rule of Emperors Caracalla (Fred Hechinger) and Geta (Joseph Quinn).\n\nAfter Lucius' first encounter with Acacius in Numidia, the warrior returns to Rome as a gladiator to see that his mother is in love with Acacius, as revealed in Vanity Fair.\n\nPascal also told VF that he nicknamed Mescal \"Brick Wall Paul\" in light of their fight scenes.\n\nRELATED: 'Gladiator 2' Star Paul Mescal Says He Was \"Too Afraid\" To Talk To Pedro Pascal & Why Sequel Film Has Him \"Stressed\"\n\nHow does Gladiator II connect to Gladiator?\n\nMescal's Lucius, son of Connie Nielsen's Lucilla, appeared as a child in Gladiator (2000). Lucius is the nephew of the late Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who murdered his father Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to take the throne in the first Gladiator(2000). Lucius is also Marcus Aurelius' (Richard Harris) grandson.\n\nMaximus (Russell Crowe) faced Commodus in the gladiator ring in the first film, and though Commodus fatally wounded Maximus, he managed to skewer the emperor before he died, fading into the great beyond to reunite with his slain wife and son. Maximus saved the boy and his mother while avenging his own family, and left a strong impression on the young Lucius, who was co-emperor of Rome alongside Commodus. Lucilla sent her son away to Numidia in between the first and second films, but he doesn't understand why, and thus there is a rift between the two 20 years later when the second film takes place.\n\nWho is behind Gladiator II?\n\nIn addition to directing, Scott Scott produces with Michael Pruss, Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher off David Scarpa's screenplay. Paramount will distribute the film.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dessi_gomez@deadline.com", "name": "Dessi Gomez", "type":

It's been over 20 years since the first Gladiator film arrived in theaters back in 2000, skyrocketing the careers of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Filmmaker Ridley Scott returns to helm Gladiator 2, except this time Paul Mescal and Pedro Pascal headline the movie. Mescal plays an older Lucius Verus (originally played by a young Spencer Treat Clark), with Pascal portraying a Roman general named Marcus Acacius, who trained under Crowe's Maximus. With the Gladiator 2 trailer coming on July 9th, it's time to feast our eyes on a poster.\n\nThe poster for Gladiator 2 features Paul Mescal's Lucius Verus on one knee in the fabled arena, rubbing dirt in his hands while a sword is stuck into the ground. Other actors named on the poster include Pedro Pascal, the returning Connie Nielsen, and Academy Award winner Denzel Washington. Gladiator 2 recently debuted a group of first-look photos, with Pascal speaking of how the film honors Maximus' legacy. Gladiator II \"has an identity that is shaped by [Maximus'] legacy,\" Pascal added. \"It wouldn't make sense for it not to.\" The Last of Us star describes Acacius as a fighter who \"learned from the best, so of course this code of honor is ingrained into his training and into his existence. But at the end of the day, he's a different person. And that can't change who he is. Maximus is Maximus, and that can't be replicated. That just makes Acacius capable of different things.\"\n\nGladiator 2 footage revealed at CinemaCon\n\nThe first footage from Gladiator 2 was screened at CinemaCon in April. \"It is possibly more exciting that the first,\" Ridley Scott said before the unfinished Gladiator II footage aired. \"Working on this film was one of the stand-out moments in my life to date,\" Paul Mescal said.\n\n\"I think when we arrived and saw the set built there... I remember being completely floored that they'd built ancient Rome,\" Joseph Quinn said.\n\nPedro Pascal remembered seeing the film in theaters twice and said this movie exceeded his expectations. Denzel Washington promised action, emotion, and spectacle. \"This is why people go to the movies,\" he said. A five-minute segment, the first-ever look at Gladiator II, then began to play.\n\nWhat is Gladiator 2 about?\n\nIn the sequel set about 15 years after 2000's Gladiator, Oscar nominee Paul Mescal (Aftersun) plays a grown-up Lucius Verus, son of Lucilla (a returning Connie Nielsen). The original Gladiator starred Crowe as the enslaved general turned gladiator idolized by Lucius (originally played by Spencer Treat Clark), who cheered \"the Spaniard\" in the games. Maximus died saving Lucius and Lucilla, having avenged his murdered son and wife with the death of power-hungry Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).\n\nThe Gladiator II cast includes two-time Oscar winner Denzel Washington (Glory, Training Day) as a slave-turned-gladiator-turned arms and commodity dealer, and Pedro Pascal (Star Wars: The Mandalorian), May Calamawy (Moon Knight), Peter Mensah (300), Matt Lucas (Alice in Wonderland), Lior Raz (6 Underground), and Tim McInnerny (Blackadder) in undisclosed roles. Joseph Quinn (The Fantastic Four) and Fred Hechinger (The White Lotus) play co-emperors Geta and Caracalla. Scott, who directed the Best Picture-winning Gladiator, also directs the sequel penned by David Scarpa (Napoleon). The new movie also reunites Scott with Oscar-winning Gladiator costume designer Janty Yates and production designer Arthur Max.\n\nGladiator II opens in theaters on November 22nd.", "source": {"uri":

Continue to check back with us as we will be adding more information as it becomes available. Summary Paul Mescal plays Lucius Verus in Gladiator II, an older version of the character from the first movie. The sequel takes place 12-15 years after the original, with Lucius living in the wilderness and eventually involved in war and gladiatorial combat. The real-world timeline difference led to recasting Lucius, with Mescal's age being more suitable for the in-universe timeline.\n\nGladiator II features Paul Mescal as the lead character, begging the question of whether he was in the first movie or is an original creation for the sequel. When it was announced that a sequel to Gladiator was in production, many were unsure of how this would be possible. The first movie centered so heavily on the titular gladiator Maximus Decimus Meridius and the events that led to his death, leading to queries about who would lead the second movie from director Ridley Scott.\n\nSince then, however, more updates about Gladiator II's cast have been announced. It was confirmed that the main stars of the movie include Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn, Denzel Washington, the returning Connie Nielsen, and Paul Mescal. Gladiator II's trailer confirmed that the latter will be the central character of the story and provided the answer as to whether he is connected to the legend of Maximus.\n\nPaul Mescal's Lucius Was In Gladiator 1 - His Character Explained Lucius Verus Was Present In The Story Of Maximus\n\nIn Gladiator II, Paul Mescal will portray Lucius Verus from the first movie. In Gladiator, Lucius was the child of Nielsen's Lucilla. Lucius struck up a friendship with Maximus early in the film before becoming co-Emperor of Rome alongside his conniving uncle, Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus. Toward the end of Gladiator, Lucius is present in the Colosseum when Maximus confronts Commodus. He watches as Commodus and Maximus are both killed, leading into the events of Gladiator II.\n\nWhat Happened To Lucius After Gladiator? Lucius' Story Between Gladiator & Gladiator II Has Been Hinted At\n\nIn Gladiator II, Lucius is evidently much older than the young child shown at the end of Gladiator. Concerning what he has been through since then, some answers have been provided by director Ridley Scott and star Paul Mescal. The former was interviewed by Rotten Tomatoes during the press tour for Napoleon during which he was asked about Mescal's character. Scott revealed that Mescal was playing Lucius and explained that the film takes place around 12-15 years after Gladiator.\n\nScott went on to say that Lucius, since the first movie, has lost contact with his mother. Lucilla believes that Lucius is dead, with Scott explaining that he has been living \"out in the wilderness.\" A further insight into the movie was provided by Vanity Fair, in which it is revealed that Lucius has been living in the town of Numidia on the northwest coast of Africa. Lucius was sent there by Lucilla to allow him to grow up without the shadow of the Roman Empire, but Gladiator II's trailer proves Mescal's Lucius becomes embroiled in war and gladiatorial combat eventually.\n\nWhy Did Gladiator 2 Recast Lucius? The Real-World Timeline Between Gladiator & Gladiator II Likely Caused Lucius' Recast\n\nWith Mescal portraying Lucius in Gladiator II, the burning question will be why Spencer Treat Clark did not return. Clark is the actor who played Lucius in Gladiator and is still working in the acting industry as of 2024. However, there is a simple reason as to why Mescal was cast as Lucius rather than bringing back Clark.\n\nAs Scott pointed out in the above interview, Gladiator II takes place around 12-15 years after the first movie in which Lucius was 12 years old. However, the span between Gladiator and Gladiator II in real life is 24 years, meaning Lucius' original actor is now 36 years old. Conversely, Mescal is 28 years of age, meaning he matches the in-universe age of Lucius much more closely than Clark. For this reason, Mescal is portraying the character in Gladiator II, continuing the legacy left behind by Maximus Decimus Meridius.\n\nGladiator II Not Yet Rated\n\nGladiator 2 is the follow-up to Ridley Scott's award-winning film Gladiator from 2000. Scott returns to direct the sequel, with Paul Mescal staring as Lucius, alongside Denzel Washington and Barry Keoghan as the villain Emperor Geta. Gladiator 2 had been stuck in development hell for years before a script written by David Scarpa finally moved forward.\n\nDirector Ridley Scott Release Date November 22, 2024 Writers David Scarpa

Connie Nielsen and Derek Jacobi return, alongside rising stars like Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger. Gladiator II is set to release in theaters on November 22, 2024.\n\nParamount Pictures has just delivered our first look at Ridley Scott's upcoming historical epic sequel to Gladiator, and it certainly seems like \"epic\" is the right word to describe the action, with Paul Mescal front and center in a movie that is set to shoot him into superstardom. Set in the same universe as its predecessor, Gladiator II resumes nearly twenty years after the first movie, with director Ridley Scott recently sharing insights into Mescal's character. Lucius, last seen as the 12-year-old nephew of Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus, has spent 15 years in obscurity, estranged from his mother who fears he may be deceased.\n\n\"He's playing Lucius. He's been out in the wilderness, and has lost touch with his mother. His mother lost touch with him. She doesn't know where he is. She thinks he might be dead.\"\n\nGladiator II, the follow-up to Ridley Scott's 2000 Oscar-winning film which starred Russell Crowe, will see at least two familiar faces reprising their roles: Connie Nielsen and Derek Jacobi. The cast is primarily made up of rising stars like Mescal and Joseph Quinn, as well as FredHechinger. The film will also see Pedro Pascal reteam with Denzel Washington, who previously shared the screen opposite each other in The Equalizer 2. Pascal, who has been consistently juggling multiple projects, prioritized Gladiator II once filming resumed following the dual strikes last summer, returning to Scott's set swiftly last November when filming was wrapping up.\n\nThe trailer features Washington's Macrinus, a former slave turned merchant and arms dealer, offering to mentor Lucius and playing kingmaker in Rome, offering Lucius the chance to gain his own brand of vengeance. The initial footage showcases unbelievable war scenes, on a much grander scale than Gladiator demonstrated. It also has plenty of throwbacks to the original film, including a very special connection offered by Lucilla to her son which ties his fate to that of Maximus (Crowe). Visually, the film looks stunning, and you can feel the combat with every smash of the blade. It looks like Scott has pulled it off once again.\n\nWhat Was the First 'Gladiator' About?\n\nClose\n\nThe film is set in ancient Rome and follows the story of Maximus, a respected Roman general who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father to seize the throne. Maximus's family is also murdered, and he is sold into slavery to become a gladiator. Despite his fall from grace, Maximus uses his position as a gladiator to gain popularity and influence.\n\nHis ultimate goal is to avenge the murders of his family and Emperor Marcus Aurelius by challenging Commodus. It was an enormous financial and critical success, and met with acclaim, especially the performances of Crowe and Phoenix, who both received Academy Award nominations for their performances. It won several Oscars, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. The film is often credited as being pivotal in the revitalization of interest in the historical epic genre.\n\nGladiator II is set to release on November 22, 2024.

Gladiator 2 promises grand action scenes and a stacked ensemble cast, including Joseph Quinn, Denzel Washington, and May Calamawy. The sequel is set to release on November 22, with original director Ridley Scott returning and David Scarpa writing the script.\n\nOne of 2024's most exciting new releases and most anticipated legacy sequels just got an exciting new look. On his official Instagram, Pedro Pascal shared a new behind-the-scenes photo of his co-star Paul Mescal in the upcoming film Gladiator 2. Mescal is sitting in a makeup chair without a shirt on, further accentuating the impressive physique that fans have been commenting on for the last week or so. Mescal recently spoke about how often movie stars work themselves into the shape of an underwear model, but his goal was to come off as more brute strength than pure aesthetics -- and it's obvious by this new BTS photo shared by his co-star that he found success in this endeavor.\n\nWhen the first batch of Gladiator 2 images were released last week, they were accompanied by several interviews with cast members and even director Ridley Scott. When talking about Mescal, Pascal spoke about how difficult it was to stand against him in the Colosseum due to his immense strength. Gladiator 2 also promises some of the most grand action scenes that movie fans have ever experienced, and all official looks at the film which have been released thus far point to this being spot on. Now that more than 20 years have passed since the release of the original Gladiator film, it's almost time to return to ancient Rome to follow those legendary figures who helped shape the course of history.\n\nWho Stars in 'Gladiator 2'?\n\nIn addition to Mescal and Pascal, the legacy sequel has anticipated a stacked ensemble cast despite not returning many of the original stars. The first Gladiator stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, and more. Nielsen is returning to reprise her role as Lucilla, but other cast members include Fantastic Four and Stranger Things star Joseph Quinn, two-time Oscar-winner Denzel Washington, with Fred Hechinger, Rory McCann, Derek Jacobi, and May Calamawy filling out the rest of the call sheet. Original director Scott is returning to helm the sequel, with David Scarpa stepping into the ring for the first time to write the script. Scarpa is best known for his previous work with Scott on Napoleon, and has also written All the Money in the World, The Day the Earth Stood Still, and The Last Castle.\n\nGladiator 2 arrives in theaters on November 22 later this year. Check out the new image above and stream the first Gladiator film on Paramount+.\n\nGladiator II\n\nAdventure\n\nAction\n\nDrama\n\nFollows Lucius, the son of Maximus' love Lucilla, after Maximus'

So reads the official tagline for Ridley Scott's Gladiator II, the director's long-awaited follow-up to his Oscar-winning 2000 epic, Gladiator.\n\nAre we excited? Just a bit. All eyes are, of course, on Paul Mescal, as Maynooth's finest makes the leap from Oscar-nominated independent favourite to big-screen blockbuster icon.\n\nMescal is the film's lead, and this is his movie star moment. Will it all work out? Time will tell. But who else is in Gladiator II, how much did it cost to make, and what took it so long to get here? Let's find out...\n\nWhat is Gladiator II about?\n\nGladiator II picks up a couple of decades after the original film -- and one thing is certain: there will be fightin', and lots of it.\n\nPaul Mescal leads the charge as Lucius Verus, grandson of Rome's former emperor Marcus Aurelius and son of Lucilla. For whatever reason, Lucius abandoned the family business and retreated to \"the wilderness\", establishing a quiet life with his wife and child in northwest Africa.\n\nThese things rarely work out -- and, after general Marcus Acacius's soldiers invade the kingdom of Numidia, poor Lucius becomes a prisoner of the Roman army. Forced into slavery, his only option is to follow in the footsteps of the legendary Maximus (portrayed in the first film by an Academy Award-winning Russell Crowe).\n\nIn other words, a new gladiator has entered the arena. Bring it on.\n\nHow did Paul Mescal land the lead role in Gladiator II?\n\nDirector Ridley Scott arranged a meeting with Mescal after watching him in Normal People. Mescal recently told Vanity Fair that the meeting lasted 30 minutes, and that they spoke about two things: the script, and Gaelic football.\n\nAn unusual combo, but Mescal must have said something right. Within three weeks, he was offered the part.\n\nIndustry reports suggest Austin Butler, Richard Madden and Miles Teller were also in the running, but Mescal emerged victorious, and the 28-year-old actor believes his nose might have had something to do with it.\n\n\"My nose just is kind of Roman,\" he explained. \"So, it's useful in this context. The nose that I absolutely hated when I was in secondary school -- and used to get ribbed for -- became very, very useful when Ridley needed somebody to be in Gladiator II.\"\n\nDid Paul Mescal bulk up for his role in Gladiator II?\n\nMaynooth's finest was already in tremendous shape ahead of the film's production, but yes, Mescal hit the gym for Gladiator II, and you had best believe he took his training seriously.\n\n\"I just wanted to be big and strong and look like somebody who can cause a bit of damage when shit hits the fan,\" he told Vanity Fair. Apparently, Mescal's co-star, the great Pedro Pascal, started calling him \"Brick Wall Paul\" on set.\n\nA fabulous moniker, and we hope to see it on T-shirts everywhere by the end of the year.\n\nWho else is in Gladiator II?\n\nMescal (our new gladiator) and Pascal (general Marcus Acacius, the film's antagonist) lead the way. In support, we have Connie Nielsen, reprising her role as Lucilla from the original film. Derek Jacobi also returns as Senator Gracchus.\n\nMeanwhile, Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger portray co-emperors Geta and Caracalla, and the inimitable Denzel Washington is Macrinus, a cruel power broker who keeps a stable of gladiators for sport.\n\nOur own Barry Keoghan had been due to star likewise, Djimon Hounsou, who played Maximus's ally Juba in the first film, was supposed to return. Alas, both actors had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts.\n\nHow much did Gladiator II cost to produce?\n\nThis is where things get expensive. Ridley Scott is said to have acquired an initial budget of $165m. A sizeable figure, and by the time Gladiator II finished shooting, there were reports that it had expanded to an eye-watering $310m. The folks at Paramount Pictures say the budget was closer to the $250m mark.\n\nWhatever the case, Scott's latest picture cost a bloody fortune, and it'll need to make an enormous impact at the box-office.\n\nHow long has Gladiator II been in the works?\n\nThey've been trying to get this one off the ground for 23 years. The issue, it seems, was figuring out how to make a Gladiator sequel without Russell Crowe's Maximus, who died in the original.\n\nFor years, filmmakers wanted to bring him back from the dead. At one point, Nick Cave was commissioned to write the screenplay. Cave's proposed Gladiator sequel (tentatively titled 'Christ Killer') was positively bananas and is said to have involved a resurrected Maximus - freed from purgatory by the Roman gods and tasked with killing Jesus Christ - living an immortal existence on earth after he accidentally murders his own son. Or something.\n\nMaximus then spends the next 2,000 years fighting in every major global battle until finally, he lands a position at the Pentagon. Legend has it that when Crowe read the screenplay, he immediately rejected it, saying \"Don't like it, mate.\"\n\nIn November 2018, Paramount finally greenlit a sequel (not the Nick Cave one), and pre-production commenced on Gladiator II.\n\nIs Russell Crowe in Gladiator II?\n\nSadly, Mr Crowe will not appear in the sequel. Speaking to podcaster Kyle Meredith in June, Crowe said he was \"slightly uncomfortable\" with the idea of a Gladiator follow-up that doesn't feature Maximus.\n\n\"Because, of course, [my character is] dead,\" he explained, \"and I have no say in what gets done. But a couple of the things I've heard, I'm like, 'No, no, no, that's not in the moral journey of that particular character.' But I can't say anything, it's not my place, I'm six-foot under. So, we'll see what that is like.\"\n\nWhen is Gladiator II released in cinemas?\n\nThe film lands in Irish cinemas on November 15. Meanwhile, in the US, it'll share a release date with the first Wicked instalment (November 22).\n\nAlready, some commentators are trying to kickstart the next Barbenheimer phenomenon. They call it 'Wickiator'. Will it become a thing? Not likely, but let's hope Gladiator II finds its audience. Mescal certainly deserves it.", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal",

Ensemble cast includes Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn, Connie Nielsen, and Denzel Washington. Set decades after the first movie, Lucius fights as a gladiator against emperors Caracalla and Geta.\n\nAfter more than two decades of waiting, Gladiator 2 is finally here, with the first trailer offering our first look at Ridley Scott's return to the swords-and-sandals epic. The highly anticipated follow-up, which will transport audiences back to the age of the Roman Empire, sees Academy Award nominee Paul Mescal in the lead as Lucius Verus who, much like his childhood idol Maximus Decimus Meridius, will find himself fighting for survival in the Colosseum.\n\nYou can check out the first trailer for Gladiator 2 below.\n\nGladiator 2 sees Oscar nominee Ridley Scott return to direct once again all these years after the first movie swept up awards, critical acclaim, and made a superstar of Russell Crowe. The sequel has amassed a stellar ensemble cast alongside Paul Mescal in the lead, with the sequel set to star Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us) as Roman general Marcus Acacius, Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things, Fantastic Four) as Caracalla, Fred Hechinger (Kraven the Hunter) as Geta, Connie Nielsen, Derek Jacobi, who both reprise their roles from the first movie, as well as May Calamawy (Moon Knight), Lior Raz (The Crowded Room), Peter Mensah (300, Avatar), and Hollywood icon Denzel Washington.\n\nRelated Gladiator 2 Star Promises the Sequel Honors the Legacy of the Original Film\n\nGladiator 2's Joseph Quinn reflected on the predecessor's legacy and his experience filming Ridley Scott's latest movie.\n\nAlongside the trailer, you can also check out the official synopsis for Gladiator 2 below, which offers some idea of where the long-awaited sequel will take us...\n\n\"Several decades after the events of Gladiator (2000), Lucius -- the grandson of Rome's former emperor Marcus Aurelius and son of Lucilla -- lives with his wife and child in Numidia. Roman soldiers led by general Marcus Acacius invade, forcing Lucius into slavery. Inspired by the story of Maximus, Lucius resolves to fight as a gladiator while opposing the rule of the young emperors Caracalla and Geta.\"\n\nDenzel Washington Plays a Former Gladiator Who Now Holds a Grudge Against the Emperors 1 Image 1 Image Close Gladiator II DramaActionAdventure Release Date November 22, 2024 Director Ridley Scott Cast Pedro Pascal , Connie Nielsen , Denzel Washington , Paul Mescal , Joseph Quinn , Djimon Hounsou Main Genre Action Writers David Scarpa Studio Paramount Pictures, Parkes/MacDonald Image Nation, Red Wagon Films Studio(s) Paramount Pictures , Universal Pictures , Scott Free Productions , Red Wagon Entertainment Distributor(s) Paramount Pictures prequel(s) Gladiator Expand\n\nOne of the most exciting parts of Gladiator 2 is the reunion of Ridley Scott and American Gangster star Denzel Washington. Scott has previously revealed several details about Washington's character, Macrinus, and it sounds like the acclaimed actor could have another Oscar nod coming his way...\n\n\"There's a parallel character, the owner of a business that supplied weapons for the Romans, who supplied the oil when they traveled, who supplied the wine they drink. They wouldn't drink water, they drank wine. When they traveled, who would supply wagons and horses and tack? There had to be the arms dealers of the period; here is a man who already rich from supplying the weapons, the catapults. His hobby is like a racing stable except it's gladiators. He's got a stable of 30 or 40 gladiators.\n\nHe likes to actually see them fight and it evolves that that's where he came from.

It stars Paul Mescal (Aftersun) as Lucius Verus, the son of Lucilla from the original film. Connie Nielsen (Wonder Woman) returns as Lucilla, and they are joined by Pedro Pascal (The Last of Us), Denzel Washington (Training Day), Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things), and Fred Hechinger (The Pale Blue Eye). Gladiator II was written by David Scarpa (Napoleon), and you can watch its first trailer below.\n\nGladiator II takes place decades after the original film, allowing Lucius to grow into Mescal. Washington is playing Macrinus, a man who seemingly using Lucius in the arena for his own gain. Quinn and Hechinger play the young emperors Geta and Caracalla, while Pascal plays General Marcus Acacius. Although unseen, Acacius trained under Maximus (Crowe's character from Gladiator) while he was in the Roman army. With giant elaborate sieges, a rhinoceros, and ship battles in a flooded Colosseum, the trailer makes Gladiator II seem bigger than the first film in every single way.\n\nGladiator II's trailer shows off a decadent Rome, which might be why the film cost so much to make. The film's budget has been a topic of debate, but it seems as if the total might be around $250 million. It's set to release at the end of the year, on November 22, 2024, and we'll need to see if it comes close to making the money back.

credited for reinvigorating the genre of historical epics.\n\n\"Gladiator II continues the epic saga of power, intrigue, and vengeance set in Ancient Rome,\" the official synopsis for the film reads. \"Years after witnessing the death of the revered hero Maximus at the hands of his uncle, Lucius [played by Mescal] is forced to enter the Colosseum after his home is conquered by the tyrannical Emperors who now lead Rome with an iron fist.\"\n\n\"With rage in his heart and the future of the Empire at stake, Lucius must look to his past to find strength and honour to return the glory of Rome to its people.\"\n\nGladiator 2 will be arriving in theatres this fall, on November 22.\n\nWhile Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix will be stepping aside for Gladiator 2, Connie Nielsen returns to the role of Lucilla for the upcoming film, and Derek Jacobi will play Gracchus again.\n\nGladiator 2 stars include Paul Mescal as Lucius, Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius, Joseph Quinn as Emperor Geta, Denzel Washington as Macrinus, and Fred Hechinger as Emperor Caracalla.\n\nWhile many people soaked up the \"Barbenheimer\" phenomenon last year, watching the films Barbie and Oppenheimer on the same day, something similar could happen in November.\n\nGladiator 2 and Wicked are both being released in theatres on Nov. 22, which means another double feature movie experience could be in our future --

The two are slated to face off in a 10-round boxing match, marking Diaz's second foray into boxing. It appears the former UFC fighter is now open to fighting anyone for the right price.Ridley Scott's 2000 epic, Gladiator, set a new standard for historical dramas, combining breathtaking production design and innovative special effects with a compelling story. Now, after more than two decades, fans eagerly await the sequel, Gladiator II. Here's everything we know so far about this highly anticipated film.\n\nMark your calendars for Friday, November 22, 2024, when Gladiator II is set to hit theaters. The film will share its release date with Jon M. Chu's adaptation of Wicked, starring Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo. This timing positions Gladiator II ahead of another major release, Moana 2, which will debut on November 27, 2024. In the United Kingdom, fans can see the film a week earlier, on November 15, 2024, as per the report by Collider.\n\nAlso Read: Who was Mike Heslin? 'Lioness' actor dies at the age of 30\n\nGiven the original Gladiator's massive box office success, grossing $503 million globally, it's expected that Gladiator II will have a strong theatrical release. The spectacle of gladiatorial combat is something fans will want to experience on the big screen. However, a streaming release on Paramount+ is also a possibility, given the studio's ownership of the Gladiator franchise, as per the report by Collider.\n\nWhile specific plot details remain under wraps, the casting of Paul Mescal offers some insights. Mescal will play an adult version of Lucius Verus, the young boy from the first film who admired Maximus. Lucius, the nephew of Commodus and son of Lucilla, appears to have taken Maximus as his role model. The story may explore Lucius's journey from the Colosseum spectator to a gladiator, continuing the legacy of Maximus.\n\nPaul Mescal: Mescal, known for his role in Normal People and an Oscar nominee for Aftersun, takes on the lead role of Lucius.\n\nDenzel Washington: The two-time Academy Award winner reunites with Ridley Scott, playing a character whose details are still under wraps. Scott hints that Washington's character embodies a life forbidden to Maximus.\n\nFred Hechinger: Hechinger replaces Barry Keoghan as Emperor Geta, a historical figure who ruled Rome from 198 to 211. The nature of Geta's character remains a mystery.\n\nPedro Pascal: Known for The Last of Us and The Mandalorian, Pascal joins the cast, adding star power to the sequel.\n\nConnie Nielsen and Derek Jacobi: Both reprise their roles from the original film as Lucilla and Senator Gracchus, respectively.\n\nDjimon Hounsou: Rumored to return as Juba, Maximus's ally from the first film.\n\nOther notable additions include Joseph Quinn, May Calamawy, Lior Raz, Peter Mensah, and Matt Lucas. Russell Crowe will not return as Maximus, given his character's fate, but he has expressed mixed feelings about the sequel, as mentioned in the report by Collider.\n\nRidley Scott returns to direct Gladiator II, with a screenplay by David Scarpa. Key crew members from the original film, such as cinematographer John Mathieson, production designer Arthur Max, and costume designer Janty Yates, also return. Filming began in June 2023, primarily in Morocco, with additional locations in Malta and the United Kingdom.\n\nIs there really going to be a Gladiator 2?\n\nTwenty-four years later, Scott returns to the arena of blood and sand with his long-awaited sequel, \"Gladiator 2.\" The film will follow an adult Lucius Verus, the son of Lucilla and nephew of Commodus.\n\nWhat is the plot for Gladiator 2?\n\n\"Gladiator 2\" will follow Lucius as he is thrust into a life of slavery after his home is invaded by General Marcus Acacius. Determined to avenge his family and defy the new young emperors, Caracalla and Geta, Lucius, like Maximus before him, fights his way through the gladiator arena.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collider_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Collider (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Historical drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Erivo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cynthia Erivo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Verus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucius Verus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_M._Chu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon M.

The poster evokes the same grandeur of the first film's poster, which featured a triumphant Russell Crowe standing in the center of the arena, prepared to fight any and all challengers.

Now fully grown, Lucius is expected to succeed the fallen Maximus Meridius, who dies at the end of the first film after slaying the loathsome emperor, Commodus. Reportedly, Lucius has lost contact with his mother Lucilla, and its been many years since they have communicated. Connie Nielsen will reprise her role as Lucius's mother in the sequel, alongside a star-studded cast worthy of an epic sequel.

On an episode of the ReelBlend podcast, Scott revealed one of the crazier ideas to bring Crowe's Maximus back from the dead. \"Nick Cave wrote the script, but I had the idea. I knew how to bring him back through a portal, back to the real world. I'm not going tell you what it is, because somebody will steal it... I talked to Nick every other day for about a month as he was writing it,\" Scott said. \"And so I said, \"We can bring him back this way.\" And what I want to do is start the film in Styx, on the edge of the ocean, and you see him, this warrior, wandering in armor. Then, it's Maximus wandering, looking for where he's going to go next. That's Scene One.\"\n\nRelated\n\n'He Is a World Builder': Joseph Quinn Praises Gladiator 2 Director Ridley Scott\n\nJoseph Quinn shares his thoughts on working with Ridley Scott for Gladiator II, and provides details on who he is playing in the upcoming sequel.\n\nClose\n\nAs fascinating as that sounds, the new course direction for the sequel fits much better with the first film, to say the least. Gladiator was a box office smash hit when it released in theaters, and raked in numerous Academy Award nominations. Scott was nominated for Best Director, while the film won Best Picture, and Crowe won for Best Actor.

It is the sequel to the 2000 historical epic starring Russell Crowe.\n\nPaul Mescal plays Lucius and Pedro Pascal is Marcus Acacius. Denzel Washington also stars.\n\n'Two warriors will rise,' says a voice. 'This is our arena now.' It is added: 'In the quest for freedom they will face the ultimate challenge.'\n\n'No mercy, no surrender,' Washington demands as men are seen fighting.\n\nGladiator comes out on November 22.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by IndieWire (@indiewire)\n\nThe long-awaited Gladiator sequel, directed by Ridley Scott, will debut 24 years after the original historical film aired in 2000.\n\nAt the time, the OG flick won five Oscars from its 11 nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe's portrayal of gladiator Maximus.\n\nGladiator II centers on the 28-year-old's character, Lucius Verus, the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen).\n\nViewers will now see Lucius all grown up, with the story taking place years after the first film ended.\n\nFans of the series will remember that Lucius is also the nephew of Marcus' son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who killed his father to seize the throne.\n\nIn Gladiator, Commodus fought Maximus in the gladiator ring and became mortally wounded.\n\nHowever, the warrior managed to puncture the emperor and save the young boy and his mother while avenging his own wife and son's death, something that made a lasting impact on Lucius.\n\nThe star-studded cast also includes Denzel Washington, Derek Jacobi, Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger, and Lior Raz.\n\nDavid Scarpa scripted the sequel, while Ridley, Douglas Wick, Lucy Fisher, Michael Pruss and David Franzoni produced the film.\n\nPaul Mescal was seen shirtless with a burlap skirt on and gold cuffs on his wrists in his trailer while on the set of Gladiator 2\n\nGladiator 2 centers on the character, Lucius Verus, the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). Viewers will now see Lucius all grown up, with the story taking place years after the first film ended. Fans of the series will remember that Lucius is also the nephew of Marcus' son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix)\n\nWalter Parkes, Laurie MacDonald, Raymond Kirk, and Aidan Elliott also serve as executive producers.\n\nIn a first look at the film, Paul sported a full suit of armor in one scene, while blood dripped down his face and dirt covered his arm.\n\nAnother image showed the Irish actor wielding a sword as he prepared for battle.\n\nA third shot showed Pedro in the gladiator ring, mid-action, as a sword comes his way.\n\nTalking to Vanity Fair earlier this month, Paul described his character as 'a very, very good general, which can mean a very good killer.'\n\n'I just wanted to be big and strong and look like somebody who can cause a bit of damage when shit hits the fan,' he continued about physically preparing for the role. 'I think also, sometimes, one could, in striving for that perfect look, end up looking more like an underwear model than a warrior.'\n\nAnd getting in shape gave Paul a stronger sense of self.\n\nThe Last of Us actor noted about about going up against his costar in Gladiator 2: 'It's brutal, man. I call him Brick Wall Paul,' the 49-year-old confessed to the outlet. ' He got so strong'\n\n'Muscles start to grow, and that can be deemed aesthetic in certain capacities, but there is something about feeling strong in your body that elicits just a different feeling. You carry yourself differently,' the Aftersun actor noted. 'It has an impact on you psychologically in a way that is useful for the film.'\n\nPedro also chimed in about going up against his costar in Gladiator 2.\n\n'It's brutal, man. I call him Brick Wall Paul,' the 49-year-old confessed to the outlet. 'He got so strong. I would rather be thrown from a building than have to fight him again. To go up against somebody that fit and that talented and that much younger... Outside of Ridley being a total genius, Paul is a big reason as to why I would put my poor body through that experience.'\n\nAs for why Paul himself said yes to the grueling role? As he put it to AnOther Magazine in February, 'Gladiator 2 comes across your desk and there's no way you say no to it.'\n\nThe All of Us Strangers alum added, 'But with this scale of film, and to work with Ridley Scott, it's a no-brainer. Up until this point there have been very few larger films that remotely interested me.'\n\nPaul reflected, 'It feels really right. And also there's the capacity to learn. It's the first time that I've felt a pressure of, \"God, I'm worried about box office receipts.\" It's a different metric. But Ridley shoots at a very different rhythm - he's quick and it's kinetic and wonderful. He knows exactly what he wants. It honestly reminds me of sport in a way that is really satisfying.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The sequel arrives 24 years after Scott's original Gladiator, which won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. The sequel opens in theaters in the US on November 22nd, 2024. Watch the newly revealed trailer below.\n\nIn place of Russell Crowe, who -- spoiler (!) dies at the end of the original film, Gladiator II stars Paul Mescal as Lucius Verus, the former heir to the Empire and nephew of Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus (who also died in the first film, at the hands of Crowe's Maximus).\n\nSince the events of the first film, Lucius lost touch with his mother (played by Connie Nielsen, who is returning for the sequel), went into the wilderness, became a prisoner of the Roman army and, much like his hero Maximus, now finds himself forced to fight as a gladiator.\n\nAlongside Mescal and Nielsen, Gladiator II's cast includes Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius, a Roman general who trained under Maximus but has since took a turn to the dark side; Denzel Washington as Macrinus, a power broker who keeps a stable of gladiators; and Joseph Quinn as co-emperor Geta. Meanwhile, Derek Jacobi reprises his role from the first film as Senator Gracchus.\n\nDespite having no role in Gladiator II, Crowe recently acknowledged that he was nonetheless \"slightly uncomfortable\" with the idea of the sequel. \"I'm slightly uncomfortable with the fact they're making another one -- because, of course, I'm dead and I have no say in what gets done,\" Crowe admitted during a recent appearance with Kyle Meredith With. \"But a couple of the things I've heard I'm like -- no, no, no, that's not in the moral journey of that particular character.

By finding glory in the games, this fighter has the chance to enact positive change in the entire Roman Empire. In the first film, that was General Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe). It turns out, the political reform Maximus died for didn't really stick -- isn't that always the way?\n\nIn Gladiator II, his biggest fan steps into the ring. Lucius (Mescal), the son/grandson/nephew of the former emperor(s), was sent away by his mother Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) to live beyond the reach of the empire. Empires being what they are (vast, bloody, homogenizing forces of colonization), home catches up with him eventually in the form of an invading army. Like his predecessor, Lucius finds himself in the gladiator ring with the chance to oppose the rule of two sadistic co-emperors, Geta (Quinn) and Caracalla (Fred Hechinger). \"It's very 'angry young man' drama in that sense. He can see the way Rome has kind of fallen in on itself,\" Mescal said in a recent Vanity Fair profile. \"Rome represents all the personal neglect that he felt as a child. Suddenly he's thrust back into that world and has direct proximity to all of the things that he thinks he hates and doesn't feel attached to anymore.\"\n\nIn other words: Gladiator, this time with more mommy issues! If you liked it the first time around, you'll probably like this. If you like to see handsome men doing battle, you'll probably like this. If you just like the shape of Paul Mescal's nose, you'll probably like this. There's something for everyone!", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

The Gladiator II posters hint at rivalries and mixed intentions of some of the main characters. Gladiator II is set for release on November 22.\n\nThe new posters for Gladiator 2 tease the upcoming tensions in the action film. Picking up the story over two decades after Ridley Scott's Gladiator was released back in 2000, Gladiator II tells the story of Maximus' son Lucius, who carries on a fighter legacy following the death of Maximus. The Gladiator II trailer was just released, revealing a look at the new set of characters for the historical epic film.\n\nGladiator II is set for release on November 22, 2024.\n\nNow, the official Gladiator Movie X account has revealed a series of character posters for the film. This includes looks at Pedro Pascal, Paul Mescal, Denzel Washington, Joseph Quinn, Connie Nielsen, and Fred Hechinger in their roles. Characters Lucilla (Nielsen), Lucius (Mescal), Macrinus (Washington), and Marcus Asacius (Pascal) are positioned to the left of the frame. Emperor Geta, played by Quinn, is positioned and looking off to the right, offset from the position of the other characters. Emperor Caracalla (Hechinger) is on the left of the frame but screaming and looking to the right. Check out the posters below:\n\nClose\n\nGladiator II's Cast & Character Breakdown\n\nWhile the Gladiator II posters are ostensibly simple, small details about them suggest certain plot tensions. For example, both Pascal and Washington are facing towards the right but looking off to the left. This could imply that the intentions of the two characters are muddied, or that their motivations come in somewhat mixed directions. As a result, this fact hints at tensions between Lucius, Macrinus, and the other main characters. Pascal's character's confusing intentions could result in a tragic ultimate battle between him and Mescal's character.\n\nThe new look at the Emperor character also alludes to how these characters will act. Both Geta and Caracalla look crazed in their images, with a kind of fervor in their eyes that suggests that the pairing have intense drive. The Gladiator II trailer also shows looks at Emperor Geta and Emperor Caracalla, revealing the actors in similarly unhinged states. The full extent of their roles has not yet been revealed, but the character posters are nonetheless another fascinating tease about these figures.\n\nPascal, Nielsen, Washington, Mescal, Quinn, and Hechinger are joined by an expansive supporting cast. This includes actors such as Rory McCann in the role of Tegula, Derek Jacobi in the role of Gracchus, and Tim McInnerny in the role of Thraex. Other supporting actors include Peter Mensah, May Calamawy, Matt Lucas, and Lior Raz. Like the original Gladiator, the extent of the Gladiator II ensemble is vital to its scale, and from the character posters, it seems like the sequel will also feature a talented and multifaceted cast.\n\nSource: Gladiator Movie / X\n\nGladiator II\n\nNot Yet Rated\n\nAction\n\nDrama\n\nEpic\n\nHistory\n\nAdventure\n\nGladiator 2 is the follow-up to Ridley Scott's award-winning film Gladiator from 2000.

The long-anticipated sequel is set for release on Nov. 22.\n\nLucius is the son of Lucilla (Nielsen) and the nephew of Commodus, the original film's antagonist played by Joaquin Phoenix. He was portrayed as a child by Spencer Treat Clark in the original \"Gladiator\" movie.\n\nThe sequel picks up years later with Lucius now living in the northern African region of Numidia, where he was sent by his mother as a child as it was just outside the reach of the Roman Empire. Events bring Lucius back to Rome as a gladiator, where he makes new enemies and reunites with his mother.\n\nThe supporting cast features Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius, a Roman general who trained under the command of Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe from \"Gladiator\"), Denzel Washington as Macrinus, a wealthy powerbroker in Rome who keeps a stable of gladiators for sport, and Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger as the twin emperors of Rome.\n\nRidley Scott recently told Vanity Fair that he became a fan of Mescal's after watching the actor's breakthrough performance in \"Normal People.\" The two men only spoke for about a half hour when Scott decided that Mescal was his \"Gladiator 2\" lead. The actor bulked up so much for the film that co-star Pascal told the publication it was quite challenging having to face off against him in the arena. Pascal even gave Mescal a nickname on set: \"Brick Wall Paul.\"\n\n\"He got so strong. I would rather be thrown from a building than have to fight him again,\" Pascal added. \"To go up against somebody that fit and that talented and that much younger...It's brutal, man.\"\n\nIn the original \"Gladiator,\" Russell Crowe starred as Maximus, a Roman general who is betrayed by Commodus and reduced to slavery and to fighting as a gladiator as he seeks to avenge his family. Maximus also saves the lives of Lucius and Lucilla. The film was a box office success and took of several Oscars, including best picture and best actor. Hans Zimmer was nominated for best original score and has returned to score the sequel.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Treat_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Treat Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucilla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Numidia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Numidia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hechinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Hechinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magnus Maximus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macrinus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blaise Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Zimmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hans Zimmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screen-Shot-2024-07-09-at-8.07.36-AM.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-22", "textStart": 219, "textEnd": 226}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Lucius is the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and grandson of Marcus Aurelius. \"Gladiator II\" is set 20 years after the events of the first film, with the estimated era for the sequel being 200 A.D.\n\n\"Stranger Things\" star Joseph Quinn, Pedro Pascal, and Denzel Washington co-star.\n\nThe official synopsis reads: \"From legendary director Ridley Scott, 'Gladiator II' continues the epic saga of power, intrigue, and vengeance set in Ancient Rome. Years after witnessing the death of the revered hero Maximus at the hands of his uncle, Lucius (Mescal) is forced to enter the Colosseum after his home is conquered by the tyrannical Emperors who now lead Rome with an iron fist. With rage in his heart and the future of the Empire at stake, Lucius must look to his past to find strength and honor to return the glory of Rome to its people.\"\n\nThe Paramount Pictures sequel is written by Scott's \"Napoleon\" screenwriter David Scarpa. Original \"Gladiator\" collaborators, costume designer Janty Yates and production designer Arthur Max, are returning along with director-producer Scott. Scott Free President Michael Pruss, plus Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher via Red Wagon Entertainment, are also producing.\n\nThe film is executive produced by Walter Parkes, Laurie MacDonald, Raymond Kirk, and Aidan Elliott, with Douglas Wick, Ridley Scott, Lucy Fisher, Michael Pruss, and David Franzoni producing.\n\nNew \"Gladiator\" lead Mescal previously told Esquire that he was \"stressed\" about \"Gladiator 2\" since it's the \"biggest\" film he's ever starred in. He added that Scott \"pays homage\" to the first \"Gladiator\" while still embracing a more modern story.\n\n\"I can't tell you how stressed I am talking about that film in particular, because it's definitely the biggest one I've done,\" Mescal said. \"I feel really excited, but, like, it's difficult to get away from the legacy of the film a bit. I think it's really well written and it pays homage to the first one, but it's very much something that I think I can step into and make comfortably my own.\"\n\nHe recently told Vanity Fair that the film is a \"very 'angry young man' drama\" from the perspective of Lucius and his revenge story.\n\n\"He can see the way Rome has kind of fallen in on itself,\" Mescal said. \"Rome represents all the personal neglect that he felt as a child. Suddenly he's thrust back into that world and has direct proximity to all of the things that he thinks he hates and doesn't feel attached to anymore.\"\n\nAs for his transformation into warrior Lucius, Mescal credited the workouts for also putting him a different \"psychological\" space for the character.\n\n\"Muscles start to grow, and that can be deemed aesthetic in certain capacities, but there is something about feeling strong in your body that elicits just a different feeling. You carry yourself differently,\" Mescal said. \"It has an impact on you psychologically in a way that is useful for the film.\"\n\n\"Gladiator 2\" premieres November 22 in theaters.

On Tuesday, Paramount Pictures unveiled the first teaser trailer for Gladiator 2, the highly-anticipated sequel to Ridley Scott's 2000 hit Gladiator. The Gladiator 2 trailer gives fans the first look at Lucius (Paul Mescal) and Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal), who are about to be locked in a massive duel.\n\n\"I love doing period films. I love the research. I love to create sort of smells of the period,\" Scott, who returns to direct Gladiator 2, explained in 2021. \"I think what we did with the first Gladiator...I don't like being critical of other things that have happened before, but I wasn't the biggest fan of Hollywood Roman epics, honestly. They felt artificial and so, when I was asked to consider a script, the script was not very good. But the person who gave it to me said, I want to show you one thing, and he picked up an illustration, this is true, it's called For Those About to Die by G\u00e9r\u00f4me. He holds it up. It's a picture of this big painting of the Coliseum, and in the corner there is this guy, about to tuna fork this poor bastard. He's got this thing in his neck, and he's looking up for permission to kill. I went, bloody hell, that's never been done properly before. Never. I said, I'll do it. He said you will? I said yes. Did you want to read the script? I said no, and we went off and hit the ground running around the table, and evolved the new material.\"\n\nWhat Is Gladiator 2 About?\n\nIn Gladiator 2, Lucius -- the grandson of Rome's former emperor Marcus Aurelius and son of Lucilla -- lives with his wife and child in Numidia. Roman soldiers led by general Marcus Acacius invade, forcing Lucius into slavery. Inspired by the story of Maximus, Lucius resolves to fight as a gladiator while opposing the rule of the young emperors Caracalla and Geta.\n\nGladiator 2 will also star Joseph Quinn, Connie Nielsen, Denzel Washington, May Calamawy, Fred Hechinger, Lior Raz, Derek Jacobi, Peter Mensah, and Matt Lucas. The film is directed by Ridley Scott, off of a script from David Scarpa. Russell Crowe, who originally starred as Maximus in the first Gladiator, has repeatedly expressed that he is not involved with the new sequel.\n\nGladiator 2 will be released exclusively in theaters on November 22nd.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score":

An early draft of Gladiator's script may explain Lucilla's reason for sending Lucius away: she wanted to protect him from Rome's fall. Lucilla's decision to send Lucius away may have put him in more danger, echoing the theme of unavoidable fate from the original Gladiator.\n\nPaul Mescal's Lucius was set to be emperor in the original Gladiator, but in Gladiator II, he'll be forced to fight in the Colosseum, and a cut line from the first movie explains why. Paul Mescal will play Lucius in Gladiator II, but the upcoming sequel won't be the character's first appearance. Lucius was also in the original Gladiator, though he was still a child played by Spencer Treat Clark. Since Lucius is an adult in Gladiator II, the sequel will have to explain what happened to Lucius after Gladiator.\n\nWhile many of Gladiator II's story details have already been revealed, there are still several mysteries left unanswered. It's still not clear if Lucius was Maximus' son, for example, and Denzel Washington's Gladiator II character has very few confirmed details. One of those mysteries, however, may have already been answered over 20 years ago. An early draft of the original Gladiator's script may explain one of the most important parts of Gladiator II's story months before the movie comes out in November.\n\nRelated Gladiator 2: Release Date, Cast, Story & Everything We Know\n\nMore than 20 years after the original Gladiator, the sequel is happening. Here is everything we know about Gladiator 2's release, cast, and story.\n\nLucilla Sent Lucius Away Before Gladiator 2 (But Lucius Didn't Understand Why) Close\n\nA few parts of Lucius' role in Gladiator II's story have already been confirmed thanks to some big reveals from Gladiator II's first look images. Those details revealed that after the original Gladiator, Lucius' mother, Lucilla, sent him away from Rome to a region of Northern Africa, but Lucius never understood why. It seems Lucilla's decision will be a massive plot point in Gladiator II: Lucius will return to Rome as a gladiator, and he'll have to face his mother again. Their reunion will certainly be a dramatic moment, but an early script for Gladiator may have already taken some of its mystery away.\n\nAn Early Draft Of Gladiator's Script Already Explained Why Lucilla Sent Lucius Away\n\nGladiator II will almost certainly reveal why Lucilla sent him away, but an early draft of Gladiator's script may have already explained her reasoning. The second draft of Gladiator's script, written by David Franzoni, included a scene where Lucilla told Maximus what she planned to do after Commodus' death (via IMSDb).\n\n\"My son will live. He will survive this cursed bloodline. Rome will die, and the jackals will pick her clean -- but my son will survive. Empires come and go. Cities crumble to dust. Only family matters.\"\n\nThat version of the script also had Lucilla go on to explain that she never wanted Lucius to be Emperor, and that she wanted to take him with her and \"leave this charnel house forever and never look back.\" This cut line from Gladiator's script perfectly explained why Lucilla would send Lucius away: she felt Rome was set to collapse, and she wanted to keep her son safe when it fell. Though Lucilla seems to have had noble intentions when she sent Lucius away, her actions could very well become the most tragic part of Gladiator II.\n\nLucilla's Reason For Sending Lucius Away Continues A Gladiator Trend Close\n\nThough Lucilla was right about the fall of Rome, her decision to send Lucius to Northern Africa still continues one of Gladiator's most tragic trends. The original Gladiator explored quite a few themes, from revenge to survival, but one of its most important themes may also apply to Gladiator II. In the original Gladiator, Commodus sentenced Maximus to death, but it was exactly that decision that ultimately cost him his own life, as Maximus eventually killed Commodus at the end of Gladiator. A major part of Commodus' story was that he tried to avoid destiny, and the decision he made to do so was the same one that sealed his fate.\n\nGladiator II seems set to use that same theme again, and Lucilla seems to be its focus. Lucius will return to Rome after Pedro Pascal's General Acacius captures and enslaves him in Northern Africa. That means Lucius would never have become a gladiator if Lucilla hadn't sent him away, and her efforts to protect her son put him in more danger than ever before. Lucilla did likely save Lucius' life for a short time, as he would have been a major target if he remained in Rome, but the ironic twist of fate still echoes Commodus' attempts to beat destiny.\n\nGladiator RActionAdventureDocumentaryDrama Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nRidley Scott's historical epic Gladiator stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, a Roman general who is betrayed after the death of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Pressed into slavery, Maximus is forced to fight in the Coliseum for the entertainment of the cruel new emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Rising to the challenge and inspiring the slaves, Maximus fights to undermine Commodus's unjust rule.\n\nDirector Ridley Scott Release Date May 1, 2000 Studio(s) DreamWorks Distribution , Universal Pictures , Scott Free Productions , Red Wagon Entertainment Distributor(s) DreamWorks Distribution , Universal Pictures Writers David Franzoni , John Logan , William Nicholson Cast Russell Crowe , Derek Jacobi , Oliver Reed , Connie Nielsen , Joaquin Phoenix , Djimon Hounsou , Richard Harris Runtime 155 minutes Sequel(s) Gladiator II Budget $103 million Expand\n\nLucilla's actions may even apply to Gladiator's focus on the unavoidable nature of fate even more deeply. Before he died, Maximus urged Rome to fix its corruption and reinstate the Roman Republic. Gladiator II's story details, however, revealed that Rome did not listen, and the Emperors that ruled in Lucius' absence brought even more decay to the once strong empire. If Lucius had been present, though his life would have been in danger, he may have been able to restore the Roman Republic. Lucilla's decision, however, doomed Rome to decline even further.\n\nWhile the early script of Gladiator explains Lucilla's reasoning for sending Lucius away, a major part of Gladiator II remains a mystery. Lucilla's cut line revealed that she planned to take Lucius with her, but in reality, she sent Lucius away on his own. It's still not clear why she would change her plan so drastically and send her only son - and main motivation from Gladiator - away. She must have had a very compelling, and likely dangerous, reason to do it. Even though Lucilla's reason for sending Lucius away seems to have been explained, Gladiator II will still have a very meaty mystery to explore.\n\nSource: IMSDb\n\nGladiator II Not Yet RatedActionDramaEpicHistory\n\nGladiator 2 is the follow-up to Ridley Scott's award-winning film Gladiator from 2000.

And yes, the moment has finally arrived: The first trailer for this action-packed sequel is here. Judging by the intriguing action sequences with huge explosions and sword fights, this movie is shaping up to be the sequel we've all been waiting for.\n\nStarring Paul Mescal in the lead role as Lucius, the trailer offers a very exciting glimpse into the epic battles and brutal war that await in the world of \"Gladiator.\" If you haven't yet seen the three-minute trailer or just want to experience it again (don't worry -- I've watched it a few times just to see Pedro Pascal wield a sword), then check it out below:\n\nPicking up years after the original movie, the sequel looks poised to continue the legacy of its predecessor with a fresh yet familiar intensity. \"Gladiator 2\" shifts the focus to new characters while still maintaining connections to the original narrative. This is especially true since there are several flashbacks in the trailer of when Lucius was a child.\n\nLucius (Mescal) is the now-adult son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and nephew of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who was inspired by the heroism of Maximus (Russell Crowe) in the original movie. Lucius must navigate the dangerous and complex political landscape of the Roman Empire, with the movie exploring the enduring legacy of Maximus.\n\nThe official synopsis for this highly anticipated movie reads: \"The story follows Lucius, the former heir to the Roman Empire, who becomes a gladiator after his home is invaded by the Roman army, led by General Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal), during the reign of co-emperors Caracalla (Fred Hechinger) and Geta (Joseph Quinn).\"\n\nDenzel Washington also takes on the role of Macrinus, a wealthy arms dealer who uses gladiators for sport, along with Rory McCann as Tegula and Derek Jacobi as Gracchus. It's clear that \"Gladiator 2\" features a very impressive cast, making it one of the top movies to watch this year (and it could beat \"Wicked\" as the new blockbuster combo, so move over Barbenheimer)\n\nWith Ridley Scott returning as director, \"Gladiator 2\" promises to deliver the same grand scale, intense action sequences and rich storytelling that made the original such a classic. Whether you're a die-hard fan of the original or new to the saga, \"Gladiator 2\" looks like it could be an epic cinematic experience that will leave audiences on the edge of their seats.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alix_blackburn@tomsguide.com", "name": "Alix Blackburn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucilla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hechinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Hechinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Gracchus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiberius Gracchus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McCann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McCann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caracalla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macrinus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Jacobi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derek Jacobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geta_(emperor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geta (emperor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roman army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VbzhpnEs3aUxY3DPZo28JA-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Lucillia is the mother of Lucius Verus, the character being played by Mescal.

Scott produces the movie alongside Douglas Wick, Lucy Fisher, Michael Pruss, and David Franzoni, while Walter Parkes, Laurie MacDonald, Raymond Kirk, and Aidan Elliot serve as executive producers.\n\nMescal previously said of his character in Gladiator II, via Vanity Fair, \"He wants nothing to do with the image of Rome. He wants nothing to do with it other than to tear it apart initially. The Romans were some savage, savage individuals. They would go from continent to continent and just destroy communities and nations. The film doesn't shy away from the kind of brutality of that, and the emperors at the center of it, and this kind of corrupted power that he can see through. There's a wonderful clarity to him.

The new film, appropriately-titled Gladiator II, will follow Paul Mescal as Lucius, who must become a gladiator after the Roman army invades his home. Fans can see the beginning of this new story in the Gladiator 2 trailer shared below.\n\nLucius, of course, is the young child from the first Gladiator movie. While he is the son of Roman Empress Lucilla and Lucius Verus, many fans have since theorized that he could actually be the son of Russell Crowe's Maximus. It's possible that we may even learn of his potential affair with Lucilla in the sequel, though for now we know young Lucius will use what he learned from Maximus to make his own way as a gladiator.\n\nIt's an interesting premise for a sequel, especially so many decades after the first movie was released. And, in addition to Mescal as the young gladiator, fans can also expect to see Pedro Pascal, Connie Nielsen, and Denzel Washington.\n\nA sequel to the original Gladiator had been discussed ever since the first film was released. Now, more than two decades later, it's finally happening. It's a massive endeavor for Paramount, with the budget ranging between $250 million and $310 million. Hopefully, then, the sequel will be able to perform well enough at the box office - and, if not, hopefully fans will at least be satisfied by this continuation of the epic historical drama which managed to make $465.4 million at the box office in 2000.\n\nStay tuned to ScreenGeek for any additional updates regarding Gladiator II as we have them. Hopefully this long-awaited sequel to Ridley Scott's modern classic will meet the expectations of fans. In the meantime, this trailer delivers an exciting look at the film's epic story.", "source": {"uri": "screengeek.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenGeek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_dressler@screengeek.net", "name": "Jacob Dressler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Verus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucius Verus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucilla", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roman army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Historical drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.screengeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gladiator-2-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The long-anticipated sequel is set for release on Nov. 22.\n\nThe sequel picks up years later with Lucius now living in the northern African region of Numidia, where he was sent by his mother as a child as it was just outside the reach of the Roman Empire. Events bring Lucius back to Rome as a gladiator, where he makes new enemies and reunites with his mother.\n\nThe supporting cast features Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius, a Roman general who trained under the command of Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe from \"Gladiator\"), Denzel Washington as Macrinus, a wealthy powerbroker in Rome who keeps a stable of gladiators for sport, and Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger as the twin emperors of Rome.\n\nRidley Scott recently told Vanity Fair that he became a fan of Mescal's after watching the actor's breakthrough performance in \"Normal People.\" The two men only spoke for about a half hour when Scott decided that Mescal was his \"Gladiator 2\" lead. The actor bulked up so much for the film that co-star Pascal told the publication it was quite challenging having to face off against him in the arena. Pascal even gave Mescal a nickname on set: \"Brick Wall Paul.\"\n\n\"He got so strong. I would rather be thrown from a building than have to fight him again,\" Pascal added. \"To go up against somebody that fit and that talented and that much younger...It's brutal, man.\"\n\nIn the original \"Gladiator,\" Russell Crowe starred as Maximus, a Roman general who is betrayed by Commodus and reduced to slavery and to fighting as a gladiator as he seeks to avenge his family. Maximus also saves the lives of Lucius and Lucilla. The film was a box office success and took of several Oscars, including best picture and best actor. Hans Zimmer was nominated for best original score and has returned to score the sequel.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zack_sharf@yahoo.com", "name": "Zack Sharf", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jaden_thompson@yahoo.com", "name": "Jaden Thompson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numidia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Numidia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Numidia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Algeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hechinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Hechinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magnus Maximus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macrinus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blaise Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucilla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Zimmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hans Zimmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4NWS8_IpXaxfZIAb7Fuapg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NDk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/variety.com/ab13a027d03d88bc99b62c391d89d4e6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-22", "textStart": 219, "textEnd": 226}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

Starring Mescal, Pedro Pascal, Denzel Washington, Joseph Quinn and Connie Nielsen, the film is director Scott's follow-up to his 2000 epic Gladiator that starred Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix and collected five Oscars, including best picture.\n\nSet several decades after the events of the first movie, Gladiator II centers on Lucius (Mescal) -- the grandson of former Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius -- who resides with his family in Numidia. After ending up in slavery following an invasion led by Roman general Marcus Acacius (Pascal), Lucius follows the inspiration of Maximus (played by Crowe in the original Gladiator) and focuses on competing as a gladiator.\n\nScott directed Gladiator II from a script by David Scarpa. Scott, Lucy Fisher, David Franzoni, Michael Pruss and Douglas Wick serve as producers.\n\nParamount debuted footage from the sequel at CinemaCon in Las Vegas earlier this year, where Scott said in a featurette of the new film, \"It is possibly even more extraordinary than the first.\" He added that despite arriving more than two decades after Gladiator, the follow-up feature is \"well worth the wait.\"\n\nGladiator II is a big swing for Paramount and comes as the studio's parent company is set to be acquired by a consortium led by Skydance. The sequel saw its budget expand over the course of a shoot that was put on pause last year amid Hollywood's strikes. The first Gladiator was the second-highest grossing title of 2000, surpassing $465 million at the global box office ($848 million today).\n\nMescal is known for his breakout role in the series Normal People, in addition to his work in the features Aftersun, All of Us Strangers and Foe.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter recently included Mescal on its list of 10 performers who comprise Hollywood's new A-list, alongside such stars as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Zendaya and Jenna Ortega.

Expectations are high, as the 2000 film won Best Picture and was a box office smash.\n\nIn addition to Mescal as Lucius, Gladiator II features Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius, a Roman general leading the efforts to expand Rome's empire. He captures Lucius and brings him back to Rome. Fred Hechinger plays Emperor Caracalla, while Joseph Quinn portrays Emperor Geta.

You've got a pre-established brand with big names attached to it? Yeah, sure, you can have just a whole bunch of money! And here we are, 24 years after the original Gladiator, with a sequel, director Ridley Scott at the helm once more. The film has been a long time coming, having been announced in 2018, and today after all that time the first trailer for Gladiator 2 has been released, showing off Paul Mescal (Normal People) in all his buff, bloody, sweaty glory.\n\nGladiator 2 picks things up decades after the original film, with Mescal playing Lucius, a character that was actually in the original film - he's the son of Lucilla, and the nephew of Emperor Commodus, who was portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix back in the day (Lucius was played by Spencer Treat Clark at the time, with Mescal taking over the role). After spending some time in the northern African region of Numidia, Lucius finds himself back in Rome as a gladiator (like the name of the film!) where, as the trailer above will show you, he eventually faces off against the film industry's daddy, Pedro Pascal (The Mandalorian).\n\nThe rest of the cast is pretty stacked too, including Denzel Washington (Malcolm X), Joseph Quinn (A Quiet Place: Day One) and Connie Nielsen (One Hour Photo), who is reprising her role as Lucilla from the first film.

You have to train hard to be in a film like this and I kind of loved it. Of course, it gets tiresome at certain moments.'\n\nIt comes after Paul was seen shirtless with a burlap skirt on and gold cuffs on his wrists in his trailer while on the set of Gladiator 2.\n\nThe image was shared by his costar Pedro Pascal on social media on Monday. Paul plays Lucius and Pedro is Marcus Acacius.\n\nIn the shot, Paul smiles while wearing a fake scar and a slight beard with his locks in disarray.\n\nPedro captioned the snap, along with a poster for the film, 'Come and get it. #Gladiator2 November 22.'\n\nFans flocked to the comments section to share their thoughts on the photo, with one user writing, 'This is a lot for a Monday,' while another chimed in, 'Let's get em papa.'\n\nThe long-awaited Gladiator sequel, directed by Ridley Scott, will debut 24 years after the original historical film aired in 2000.\n\nAt the time, the OG flick won five Oscars from its 11 nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe's portrayal of gladiator Maximus.\n\nAnd speaking in a new interview on Capital Radio with Jordan North on Tuesday, Paul said that the brutal schedule and physical nature of filming was merely a 'first world problem'\n\nJordan asked him of preparing for the huge blockbuster: 'Was it a hard, brutal schedule or was it okay when you could just eat everything you wanted?'\n\nThe long-awaited Gladiator sequel, directed by Ridley Scott , will debut 24 years after the original historical film aired in 2000\n\nPaul then replied: 'It's a first world problem. Like I had every amenity available to me. I had a great trainer. People telling me to eat when to eat'\n\nGladiator 2 centers on the 28-year-old's character, Lucius Verus, the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen).\n\nViewers will now see Lucius all grown up, with the story taking place years after the first film ended.\n\nFans of the series will remember that Lucius is also the nephew of Marcus' son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who killed his father to seize the throne.\n\nIn Gladiator, Commodus fought Maximus in the gladiator ring and became mortally wounded.\n\nHowever, the warrior managed to puncture the emperor and save the young boy and his mother while avenging his own wife and son's death, something that made a lasting impact on Lucius.\n\nRead MoreEXCLUSIVE Gladiator 2 star Paul Mescal is seen in character as battered and bloodied Lucius for the FIRST time\n\nThe star-studded cast also includes Denzel Washington, Derek Jacobi, Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger, and Lior Raz.\n\nDavid Scarpa scripted the sequel, while Ridley, Douglas Wick, Lucy Fisher, Michael Pruss and David Franzoni produced the film.\n\nWalter Parkes, Laurie MacDonald, Raymond Kirk, and Aidan Elliott also serve as executive producers.\n\nIn a first look at the film, Paul sported a full suit of armor in one scene, while blood dripped down his face and dirt covered his arm.\n\nAnother image showed the Irish actor wielding a sword as he prepared for battle.\n\nA third shot showed Pedro in the gladiator ring, mid-action, as a sword comes his way.\n\nTalking to Vanity Fair earlier this month, Paul described his character as 'a very, very good general, which can mean a very good killer.'\n\n'I just wanted to be big and strong and look like somebody who can cause a bit of damage when shit hits the fan,' he continued about physically preparing for the role. 'I think also, sometimes, one could, in striving for that perfect look, end up looking more like an underwear model than a warrior.'\n\nAnd getting in shape gave Paul a stronger sense of self.\n\n'Muscles start to grow, and that can be deemed aesthetic in certain capacities, but there is something about feeling strong in your body that elicits just a different feeling. You carry yourself differently,' the Aftersun actor noted.\n\n'It has an impact on you psychologically in a way that is useful for the film.'\n\nPedro also chimed in about going up against his costar in Gladiator 2.\n\n'It's brutal, man. I call him Brick Wall Paul,' the 49-year-old confessed to the outlet.\n\n'He got so strong. I would rather be thrown from a building than have to fight him again.\n\n'To go up against somebody that fit and that talented and that much younger... Outside of Ridley being a total genius, Paul is a big reason as to why I would put my poor body through that experience.'\n\nRussell Crowe portrayed Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius in the original and won the Oscar for Best Actor for his work in the film\n\nAs for why Paul himself said yes to the grueling role? As he put it to AnOther Magazine in February, 'Gladiator 2 comes across your desk and there's no way you say no to it.'\n\nThe All of Us Strangers alum added: 'But with this scale of film, and to work with Ridley Scott, it's a no-brainer. Up until this point there have been very few larger films that remotely interested me.'\n\nPaul reflected: 'It feels really right. And also there's the capacity to learn. It's the first time that I've felt a pressure of, 'God, I'm worried about box office receipts.'\n\n'It's a different metric. But Ridley shoots at a very different rhythm - he's quick and it's kinetic and wonderful. He knows exactly what he wants. It honestly reminds me of sport in a way that is really satisfying.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Denzel Washington's character, Macrinus, serves as a Proximo replacement by sponsoring gladiators. Macrinus has a grudge against the co-emperors and may have a change of heart, potentially aiding Lucius in the sequel.\n\nDenzel Washington's Gladiator II role echoes a storyline from the original movie, making the actor's character a perfect replacement for one of the 2000 movie's most memorable personalities. Directed by Ridley Scott, Gladiator 2 is a sequel to the filmmaker's Oscar-winning Gladiator. While the first film followed Russell Crowe's Maximus, a betrayed Roman general-turned-gladiator, Gladiator 2 centers on Lucius (Paul Mescal). A former heir to the Roman Empire, Lucius becomes a gladiator only after general Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal) invades his home under the rule of co-emperors Caracalla (Joseph Quinn) and Geta (Fred Hechinger).\n\nAny Gladiator 2 cast and character guide will reiterate that legacy is a key part of the sequel. After all, Lucius is the grandson of Rome's former emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), who was murdered by his power-hungry son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) at the beginning of Gladiator. Marcus Aurelius' death is what prompts Maximus' entire story arc. Needless to say, the ramifications of Commodus' actions are still shaping his descendants' lives decades later. However, Lucius is far from the only Gladiator 2 character who echoes someone from Scott's original film -- case in point being Denzel Washington's character, Macrinus.\n\nDenzel Washington's Gladiator 2 Character Can Fulfill The Role Of Proximo Macrinus Is A Sponsor Of Gladiators In Ridley Scott's Sequel Close\n\nIn the wake of Marcus Aurelius' murder, Crowe's Maximus is enslaved and, eventually, purchased by a gruff gladiator trainer called Antonius Proximo (Oliver Reed). Based on the few details released about Gladiator 2, it sounds like Denzel Washington's Macrinus will fill a similar role to Gladiator's Proximo. Scott has shared that Denzel Washington's Gladiator 2 character, Macrinus, is a formerly enslaved person who has gone on to gain great wealth and influence. While Macrinus initially found success as a merchant, he eventually became a sponsor of gladiators. In short, he's an arms dealer who's heavily involved in Rome's gladitorial scene.\n\n...there's no denying the parallels between Washington's character and Reed's gladiator trainer.\n\nWith both Lucius and Marcus Acacius, Pedro Pascal's Gladiator 2 character, pushed into being gladiators for various reasons, it's pretty clear how and why Macrinus figures into the story. Still, there's no denying the parallels between Washington's character and Reed's gladiator trainer. In the original film, Proximo enslaves warriors like Maximus and Juba (Djimon Hounsou), Maximus' ally, and even reveals that he was freed from being enslaved as a gladiator by the late Marcus Aurelius. In Gladiator 2, Washington's Macrinus is an arms dealer with a stable of gladiators, making his character the perfect Proximo replacement from a narrative standpoint.\n\nRelated 2024 Now Has A Box Office Battle To Rival Barbenheimer\n\nUniversal Pictures announced that Wicked, an adaptation of the Broadway musical, will be released a week earlier, setting up 2024's Barbenheimer.\n\nWill Denzel Washington's Gladiator 2 Character End Up Helping Paul Mescal's Lucius? Macrinus Also Has Reason To Hate Gladiator 2's Co-Emperors Close\n\nGladiator's Proximo really can't be considered a good person. Although he mentors Maximus and Juba and aids their revenge quest, he also enslaves the men. According to Vanity Fair, Washington's Gladiator 2 character is considered \"cruel\" by his own stable-full of gladiators. A formerly enslaved person himself, Macrinus grows his power by leveraging the same corrupt system that harmed him in the first place. While Macrinus is described as having a grudge against the emperors, he seems more like a secondary antagonist. Of course, Macrinus might have a change of heart and aid Lucius before Gladiator 2's credits roll.\n\nGladiator II is slated for a November 22, 2024 theatrical release.\n\nGladiator II Not Yet RatedActionDramaEpicHistory\n\nGladiator 2 is the follow-up to Ridley Scott's award-winning film Gladiator from 2000. Scott returns to direct the sequel, with Paul Mescal staring as Lucius, alongside Denzel Washington and Barry Keoghan as the villain Emperor Geta. Gladiator 2 had been stuck in development hell for years before a script written by David Scarpa finally moved forward.\n\nDirector Ridley Scott Release Date November 22, 2024 Studio(s) Paramount

Continue to check back with us as we will be adding more information as it becomes available. Summary Gladiator 2 trailer exceeds expectations, showcasing impressive visuals and promising performances. The star-studded cast, including Paul Mescal, Denzel Washington, and Pedro Pascal, adds excitement to the sequel. Despite initial doubts, the trailer indicates that Gladiator 2 could be one of the best movies of the year.\n\nGladiator 2's first trailer has been released, and it looks better than I ever imagined. When Ridley Scott announced his plans to direct a Gladiator sequel two decades after the first movie, I had doubts about whether this was a good idea. Still, compared to the number of legacy sequels and reboots released every year, Gladiator 2 did sound like a more interesting project. That said, considering how difficult it is to replicate the magic of a classic like Gladiator, I needed to see what the first trailer was going to look like first.\n\nNaturally, there were a lot of reasons to be excited about the sequel even before the trailer came out. This includes the Gladiator 2 cast, which includes names like Paul Mescal, Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, Connie Nielsen, and Joseph Quinn. The first couple of Gladiator 2 images and the official poster got me excited, but I could not wait to see what the movie was actually going to look like. Fortunately, not only did the trailer not disappoint, it blew my expectations out of the water.\n\nGladiator 2's Trailer Is Brilliant The visuals and the performance look promising.\n\nThe first trailer for Gladiator 2 looks much better than I thought it would. Although it is no surprise that a Ridley Scott movie looks good, there were a lot of reasons to be concerned about what Gladiator 2 was going to be like. It may be too soon to say whether the sequel will work, especially compared to the first movie, but the trailer is brilliant. From the visuals to what we have seen from the performances, Gladiator 2 is shaping up to be one of the best movies of the year based on the first trailer.\n\nGladiator II\n\nGladiator 2 is the follow-up to Ridley Scott's award-winning film Gladiator from 2000.

The trailer for Gladiator 2 has finally premiered and the Internet is feasting on the new images from the movie. Upon the first photos of Denzel Waszhington in his film hitting the timeline, there were some strong reactiosn to what the plot of Gladiator 2 would be. (There's also Paul Mescal and Pedro Pascal fighting in leather armor for those who are so inclined...) Stranger Things Darling Joseph Quinn's look as one of the new emperors has to seen to be believed. Red hair just looks bizarre on Eddie Munson.\n\nStill, these new character posters works wonders in teasing all of the carnage to come in this movie. If there's one thing that Ridley Scott is known for it's that the action sequences are not going to hold back. A lot of fans cheered when their favorite actors were announced for Gladiator 2. But, now they're left wondering if they'll even make it through half of the movie. One thing is for sure, we're in for a wild ride when Gladiator 2 hits theaters. Keep scrolling for more of the character posters from the upcoming movie!\n\nWhat Is Gladiator 2 About?\n\n\"From legendary director Ridley Scott, Gladiator II continues the epic saga of power, intrigue, and vengeance set in Ancient Rome. Years after witnessing the death of the revered hero Maximus at the hands of his uncle, Lucius (Paul Mescal) is forced to enter the Colosseum after his home is conquered by the tyrannical Emperors who now lead Rome with an iron fist. With rage in his heart and the future of the Empire at stake, Lucius must look to his past to find strength and honor to return the glory of Rome to its people.\"\n\nThe cast for Gladiator 2 includes Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger, Lior Raz, Derek Jacobi with Connie Nielsen and Denzel Washington. David Scarpa penned the screenplay and Peter Craig helped craft the story. Producing the return to Ancient Rome are Ridley Scott, Douglas Wick, Lucy Fisher, Michael Pruss and David Franzoni.\n\nRidley Scott Is Excited To Revisit Gladiator\n\nThis project was announced a while ago. For Scott, returning to one of his most beloved films was a bit of a tall task. He told Deadline that his team really had to get in the lab to ensure that Gladiator 2 would live up to expectations. The initial reactions to Denzel Washington's casting and images of Pedro Pascal and Paul Mescal as main characters help show that they are on the right track with this legacy sequel.\n\n\"I love doing period films. I love the research. I love to create sort of smells of the period,\" Scott said back then. \"I think what we did with the first Gladiator...I don't like being critical of other things that have happened before, but I wasn't the biggest fan of Hollywood Roman epics, honestly. They felt artificial and so, when I was asked to consider a script, the script was not very good. But the person who gave it to me said, I want to show you one thing, and he picked up an illustration, this is true, it's called For Those About to Die by G\u00e9r\u00f4me. He holds it up.\"\n\n\"It's a picture of this big painting of the Coliseum, and in the corner there is this guy, about to tuna fork this poor bastard. He's got this thing in his neck, and he's looking up for permission to kill. I went, bloody hell, that's never been done properly before. Never. I said, I'll do it. He said you will? I said yes. Did you want to read the script? I said no, and we went off and hit the ground running around the table, and evolved the new material.\"\n\nDo you like this new look at Gladiator?

I never forgot it, that a slave could take revenge against an emperor,\" Lucius says, before we see him in a flashback from the first film, being dragged to safety by his mother.\n\nA quick recap of the first Gladiator film: the plot revolves around upstanding Roman general, Maximus Decimus Meridius, who was asked to inherit the role of emperor from ailing Marcus Aurelius.\n\nBut Commodus murdered the emperor, took the title, before killing Maximus' family and leaving him a slave. Maximus rose up to become a gladiator, returning to Rome in order to exact his revenge.\n\nWorldhistory.org describes gladiatorial contests as \"bloody entertainment... an opportunity for emperors to display their wealth\", where up to 50,000 spectators enjoyed \"contests which were literally a matter of life and death\".\n\nSome battles included wild animals - Gladiator featured tigers in the arena, while an angry-looking rhino with a bloodied horn charges at Mescal in the sequel.\n\nIt's fair to say the first film caused a flurry of excitement among admirers of Crowe's powerful portrayal of Maximus.\n\nGiven Mescal enjoyed a huge surge in his fanbase after he starred in BBC drama Normal People, it's possible his role in Gladiator II may have a similar impact.\n\nLucius is undoubtedly reminiscent of the honourable Maximus, battling from below while having a much higher purpose.\n\nIn the sequel, Lucius has been captured from his home far from Rome, and brought there as a prisoner.\n\nHe becomes a gladiator, working for Macrinus, played by Denzel Washington, who sponsors fighters much like Oliver Reed's Proximo did in the first film.\n\nLucius protects his birthright, saying he doesn't know where he was born, adding: \"I never knew a mother and or father.\"\n\n\"You will be my instrument,\" Macrinus responds.\n\nIt appears that the twin emperors now in place - played by Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger - are also corrupt. We see them laugh demonically while gladiators die in their mock water battle (which did happen in real life).\n\nLucius's mother, Lucilla, played by Connie Nielsen in the original film as well, watches with horror while her son fights beneath her, although we don't know if she recognises him.\n\nShe takes him full circle, back to Maximus, by giving him a ring which belonged to the Roman general before he died.\n\nLike the original, the film appears to be about the corruption of power, as worthy, embattled individuals take on the might of Rome's rulers.\n\nLucius favours \"strength and honour\", while another Roman general, Marcus Acacius, played by The Last of Us star Pedro Pascal, says: \"I will not waste another generation of young men for their vanity,\" alongside footage of the emperors.\n\nWe don't yet know enough about Pascal's character to know where his morals fully lie.\n\nThe trailer ends with Mescal and Pascal battling in the arena with swords, with the gladiator looking like he has the advantage, as he holds two swords crossed over the army general's neck.\n\nInitial responses on X were a mixture of both positive and negative, with some people excited for the sequel, while others said it wouldn't be as good as the original.\n\nSome fans spotted what looked like sharks in the water battle, with filmmaker Kyle Prohaska saying: \"I'm all in on Gladiator II.

This is definitely one of those sequels nobody asked for, but this one looks better than most.\"\n\nAnother post, from a user called @FilmmakerJeff, called the trailer \"underwhelming\".\n\n\"I hate to report that I'm not a fan of the Gladiator II trailer,\" he said.\n\n\"Terrible music choice, nothing from it gave me reassurance that it could be even close to as good as the original, and honestly, it looks like it could be pretty good at best. My hype meter dropped a notch.\"\n\nThere was also disagreement on social media over the soundtrack, which was No Church in the Wild, by Jay-Z and Kanye West.\n\nOne user wrote: \"In what world does the sequel to Ridley Scott's Gladiator need Jay-Z and Kanye West? Stop shoehorning songs into trailers.\"\n\nAnother in favour though, wrote: \"That pounding hip-hop really works on the Gladiator 2 trailer. Fits so well to the era.\"\n\nSir Ridley, who made 2023's epic Oscar and Bafta-nominated film Napoleon, told Deadline last year that he made Gladiator II because \"economically, it makes sense...\n\n\"I thought the [first] film was, as it were, completely satisfactory, creatively complete, so why muck with it, right?\n\n\"But these cycles keep going on and on and on, they repeat globally for the last 20 years. It started to spell itself out as an obvious thing to do, and that's how it evolved.\"\n\nGladiator II is released in UK cinemas in November.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

In an unexpected turn of events for the son of a Roman noblewoman, Lucius ends up embarking on a journey that echoes the struggles of Russell Crowe's character in the first film.\n\nDirected by Scott, the movie also stars The Last of Us actor Pedro Pascal, Denzel Washington and Stranger Things' Joseph Quinn, with Nielsen reprising her role as Lucilla and Sir Derek Jacobi returning as Senator Gracchus.\n\nAs we await for the movie's November release, here's everything you need to know about the story and its many links to Scott's 2000 movie.\n\nSet nearly two decades after the events of the first film, Gladiator II follows Lucius as he grows up far away from Rome and his mother, after Lucilla sends him to the northern coast of Africa when he is just a child.\n\nIn a region called Numidia, just outside of the Roman Empire's reach, Lucius has made a life for himself with his wife and child. However, war comes knocking on his door.\n\n\"He's taken root in a seacoast town in Numidia. He's a blue-eyed, fair-skinned man with red hair, and he couldn't be more different from the inhabitants. It's one of the last surviving civilisations, as the Romans begin to descend in North Africa and take it all over,\" Scott explained to Vanity Fair.\n\nAs it turns out, Rome was not the \"dream\" Maximus imagined it would be after his death.\n\nThe hopeful ending of Gladiator hasn't come to fruition, as a wicked duo of leaders now run the empire. As we see in the first trailer for Gladiator II, Emperor Caracalla (played by Fred Hechinger) and Emperor Geta (Quinn) are dangerous and power-hungry.\n\nMuch like in the first movie, a rebellion starts brewing in order to topple their leadership of the Roman Empire, and Mescal's Lucius becomes a key part in it.\n\nHis thirst for revenge against those responsible for the destruction of his home is intense, and there's someone who can make use of that rage -- powerbroker Macrinus (played by Denzel Washington), an arms dealer who will buy him as a slave and turn him into a gladiator.\n\nAnd we know how gladiators are capable of defying an Emperor (or two).\n\nBeyond the obvious connection with a grown-up Lucius as protagonist, there are other characters directly linking the sequel to the first movie.\n\nConnie Nielsen reprises her role as Lucilla, who doesn't recognise her son when he arrives at the Colosseum as a gladiator. Almost the same way she didn't recognise Maximus when he fought for the first time in Rome in Gladiator! We are expecting an epic reveal scene like in the first movie, of course.\n\nLucilla is now in love with a Roman general, Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal), who is connected to Russell Crowe's character too -- he trained as a junior officer under Maximus. He wasn't featured in the first movie, though.\n\n\"This movie has an identity that is shaped by his legacy. It wouldn't make sense for it not to,\" Pascal told Vanity Fair regarding the connections to Maximus, describing his character as a fighter who \"learned from the best, so of course this code of honour is ingrained into his training and into his existence.\"\n\n\"But at the end of the day, he's a different person. And that can't change who he is. Maximus is Maximus, and that can't be replicated. That just makes Acacius capable of different things.\"\n\nRemember how Lucius wants to take revenge after the destruction of Numidia? Well, Marcus Acacius was one of the key generals who led the Roman forces that day, facing Lucius in the battlefield.\n\nNow, Mescal's character is looking for a rematch in the Colosseum, and the Emperors are happy to send Marcus to his demise if that means the masses will be entertained. Where will Lucilla stand in this rivalry between the two men?\n\nNo, Russell Crowe is not in Gladiator 2.\n\nThe actor is featured in the first trailer, though, to remind viewers of his last scene in the first movie. The character died, so the only way he could have been back for the sequel was in a flashback.\n\nHowever, Crowe has repeatedly denied his involvement in the new movie, even saying he is \"slightly uncomfortable with the fact they're making another one.\" (via The Independent)\n\n\"Because, of course, I'm dead and I have no say in what gets done,\" he added.\n\nCrowe might not be part of Gladiator II, but his character still has a special place in the story. In the first trailer, we see Nielsen's Lucilla giving his son Maximus' ring. We also see Lucius admiring Maximus' armour and weapons, which are hanging from a wall.\n\nThe legacy of Russell Crowe's character seems to be very much alive in the sequel, with his vision of what Rome could be still remembered as a possible and hopeful dream for some of the characters.\n\nAs mentioned above, the last connection between Gladiator and Gladiator II is the return of Sir Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus, although we don't know how big his role will be for the sequel.\n\nAsked about what Gladiator II is really about, Paul Mescal told Vanity Fair: \"What human beings will do to survive, but also what human beings will do to win.\"\n\n\"We see that in the arena, but also in the political struggle that's going on outside of my character's storyline, where you see there's other characters striving and pulling for power.\n\n\"Where's the space for humanity? Where's the space for love, familial connection? And ultimately, will those things overcome this kind of greed and power? Those things are oftentimes directly in conflict with each other.\"", "source": {"uri": "digitalspy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Spy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The story is set two decades after the events of the Russell Crowe-led movie. The epic sequel also stars Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger, Lior Raz, Derek Jacobi, Nielsen, and Denzel Washington.\n\nMescal, 28, said he is excited for the project. \"I'm so excited to present the first official trailer of Gladiator II. With visionary director, Ridley Scott at the helm, Gladiator II promises to deliver the biggest action sequences ever put to film. Enjoy this first look and we truly can't wait to see you in cinemas this November.\"\n\nThe sequel comes after 24 years after the release of the first film Gladiator which starred Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Spencer Treat Clark and Oliver Reed in the lead. It was helmed by Scott and released on September 1, 2000. The film was a massive success and won five Oscars out of 11 nominations. Besides the Academy Awards, Gladiator won several BAFTA awards and two Golden Globes.\n\nGladiator 2 is slated to release on November 15 in India in English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu languages. It will release in the United States of India a week later on November 22. (With inputs from PTI)\n\nThe DNA app is now available for download on the Google Play Store.

Ridley Scott is also returning to direct the sequel.\n\nSo from the plot, trailer and cast, here's everything we know about Gladiator 2.\n\nIf you've watched the first Gladiator film then you'll probably have put together that the second film can't and won't be following Russell's character Maximus Meridius.\n\nGladiator 2 is reportedly set 15-years after Maximus dies in the arena and will follow the story of Lucius Verus, the former emperor of Rome's grandson.\n\nIf you hate to see the change up, don't fret, because you'll still be getting what you know and love from the first Gladiator in its sequel.\n\nAfter his family is overthrown, Lucius is sent to Northern Africa in an attempt to save his life.\n\nHe grows up and builds a family there, but his world is turned upside down when the Roman empire begins to encroach on the new continent, causing him to become a slave forced to fight in the arena.\n\nMuch like Maximus before him, Lucius plans to use the way of the gladiator to avenge his family and contest the overthrowing emperors Caracalla and Geta.\n\nGladiator 2 will touch upon Lucius' childhood, especially his complicated relationship with his mother Lucilla, who was the one who initially sent him away to Africa.\n\nIt's been announced that Gladiator 2 will be released in the UK on 15th November 2024 and in the United States on the 22nd of November.\n\nLucius Verus is the son of Lucilla and the direct descendant of Emperor Marcus Aurelius as well as the rightful heir of Imperial Rome. After their family fell, Lucilla sent Lucius to Numidia for his safety and years passed by before the Roman Empire came knocking at his door once more.\n\nNow with a wife and child, Lucius is taken back to Rome as a prisoner of war and forced into the gladiator arena.\n\nYou may recognise Paul from his huge hits such as Normal People, All Of Us Strangers and Aftersun.\n\nMarcus Acacius is a Roman general who previously trained under Maximus Meridius in the Roman Army. It's Marcus who destroys Numidia and captures Lucius to take back to Rome.\n\nYou'll recognise Pedro Pascal from his iconic roles as Oberyn Martell in Game of Thrones, DEA Agent Javier Pe\u00f1a in Narcos, Din Djarin in The Mandalorian and Joel in The Last of Us.\n\nMacrinus is a former slave who somehow beat the system and managed to gain wealth through arms and commodity dealing, but he holds no love for the Emperors.\n\nMacrinus is heavily involved in the gladiator games and supposedly holds a stable full of fighters.\n\nDenzel Washington surely needs no introduction but you may recognise him from his roles in Oscar-winning films such as Glory and Training Day, or accolades films such as American Gangster and The Equalizer trilogy.\n\nLucilla will be one of the two returning characters in Gladiator 2 as the daughter of Emperor Marcus Aurelius and sister of Emperor Commodus, who was played by Joaquin Phoenix in the first film.\n\nLucilla is a careful political player and finds herself in danger from the new twin Emperors Geta and Caracalla in the current climate.\n\nYou'll recognise Connie Nielsen from the original Gladiator which was her breakout role, as well as DC's Wonder Woman and Wonder Woman 1984.\n\nYou'll remember Senator Gracchus the senator who fought for the restoration of the Roman Republic.\n\nAlongside Lucilla, Senator Gracchus is one of only two returning characters from the first film.\n\nSir Derek Jacobi is a British actor who needs no introduction from Doctor Who, to Othello, Hamlet, The King's Speech, and Murder on the Orient Express, Sir Derek has done it all.\n\nEmperor Geta will be one-half of the sinister new twin co-emperors of Rome. Their partnership showcases the virtuous decline of the Roman empire.\n\nYou'll recognise Joseph Quinn from his role as metalhead Eddie Munson in Stranger Things, although he looks very different.\n\nJoseph's career has kicked off in 2023 as he currently starts in the newest installment of A Quiet Place: Day One alongside Lupita Nyongo as well as being cast as The Human Torch in Marvel's Fantastic Four.\n\nEmperor Caracalla the the other half of the evil emperors who have leaked their darkness all over Rome.\n\nFred Hechinger will mostly be recognised for his roles in The White Lotus and Pam & Tommy.\n\nBut that's hardly where the star-studded cast ends, check out the full list below.", "source": {"uri": "heart.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heart"}, "authors":

The plot follows Lucius, who lives peacefully with his family in Numidia until General Marcus Acacius' (Pedro Pascal) invasion forces him into slavery.

The producers are Douglas Wick, Ridley Scott, Lucy Fisher, Michael Pruss, and David Franzoni, with Walter Parkes, Laurie MacDonald, Raymond Kirk, and Aidan Elliott serving as executive producers.\n\n'Gladiator II' will open on November 22, competing with Universal Pictures' 'Wicked' and Angel Studios' drama 'Bonhoeffer.'

(Image Credit: Instagram/Vanity Fair)\n\nThe anticipation for Gladiator II had reached fever pitch with the release of its logo and poster, officially confirming the title of the highly awaited sequel just seven months before its release. Now the makers have released the official poster that seems to have intrigued the fans further.\n\nDirector Ridley Scott, who recently helmed Napoleon, returns to direct the follow-up to his Oscar-winning epic. The new film will focus on Lucius, the son of Lucilla, portrayed by Paul Mescal. Lucilla was originally played by Connie Nielsen in the 2000 film.\n\nMescal, who earned an Oscar nomination in 2022 for Aftersun, had mixed feelings about the potential increase in fame that Gladiator II might bring. He had joked that he would be \"profoundly depressed\" if the sequel made him even more famous than he currently is.\n\nConnie Nielsen returns for the sequel, joining an impressive cast that includes Pedro Pascal, Denzel Washington, and Stranger Things star Joseph Quinn. Derek Jacobi will reprise his role as Senator Gracchus. Since the project was first announced, it was informally known as Gladiator 2, but the poster confirmed that the official title is Gladiator II.\n\nThe film's tagline, \"What we do in life echoes in eternity,\" is a quote from Maximus Decimus Meridius in the original film. This nostalgic touch is sure to resonate with fans of the 2000 classic.\n\nThe original Gladiator followed Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius, played by Russell Crowe, who was forced into slavery following the murder of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, portrayed by Richard Harris. The film was a critical and commercial success, earning 12 Oscar nominations and winning five, including Best Picture.\n\n#### Russell Crowe's Reflections\n\nRussell Crowe, who won an Academy Award for his role in the original film, has denied rumours of a flashback appearance in the sequel. He admitted to feeling \"jealous\" of Mescal's opportunity, reflecting on how the original film was a transformative experience for him. Crowe shared, \"I was a much younger man, obviously, and it was a huge experience in my life. It's something that changed my life, really. It changed the way people regarded me and what I do for a living.\"\n\nGladiator II is set to hit theaters on November 22, 2024. With Ridley Scott at the helm and a stellar cast, the sequel promises to capture the epic grandeur and emotional depth that made the original a timeless classic.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Napoleon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftersun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aftersun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Jacobi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derek Jacobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roman emperor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Aurelius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Picture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2024/07/20240708142047_gladiator.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Inspired by the story of Maximus, Lucius resolves to fight as a gladiator while opposing the rule of the young emperors Caracalla and Geta.

'It has an impact on you psychologically in a way that is useful for the film.'\n\nMescal previously admitted he couldn't resist the opportunity to play Lucius after starring in a string of predominantly British features.\n\nHe told AnOther Magazine: 'Gladiator II comes across your desk and there's no way you say no to it.'\n\n'But with this scale of film, and to work with Ridley Scott, it's a no-brainer. Up until this point there have been very few larger films that remotely interested me.'\n\nHe added: 'It feels really right. And also there's the capacity to learn. It's the first time that I've felt a pressure of, \"God, I'm worried about box office receipts.\" It's a different metric.\n\n'But Ridley shoots at a very different rhythm - he's quick and it's kinetic and wonderful.

Fans of the series will remember that Lucius is also the nephew of Marcus' son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix)\n\nWalter Parkes, Laurie MacDonald, Raymond Kirk, and Aidan Elliott also serve as executive producers.\n\nIn a first look at the film, Paul sported a full suit of armor in one scene, while blood dripped down his face and dirt covered his arm.\n\nAnother image showed the Irish actor wielding a sword as he prepared for battle.\n\nA third shot showed Pedro in the gladiator ring, mid-action, as a sword comes his way.\n\nTalking to Vanity Fair earlier this month, Paul described his character as 'a very, very good general, which can mean a very good killer.'\n\n'I just wanted to be big and strong and look like somebody who can cause a bit of damage when shit hits the fan,' he continued about physically preparing for the role. 'I think also, sometimes, one could, in striving for that perfect look, end up looking more like an underwear model than a warrior.'\n\nAnd getting in shape gave Paul a stronger sense of self.\n\nThe Last of Us actor noted about about going up against his costar in Gladiator 2: 'It's brutal, man. I call him Brick Wall Paul,' the 49-year-old confessed to the outlet. ' He got so strong'\n\n'Muscles start to grow, and that can be deemed aesthetic in certain capacities, but there is something about feeling strong in your body that elicits just a different feeling. You carry yourself differently,' the Aftersun actor noted. 'It has an impact on you psychologically in a way that is useful for the film.'\n\nPedro also chimed in about going up against his costar in Gladiator 2.\n\n'It's brutal, man. I call him Brick Wall Paul,' the 49-year-old confessed to the outlet. 'He got so strong. I would rather be thrown from a building than have to fight him again. To go up against somebody that fit and that talented and that much younger... Outside of Ridley being a total genius, Paul is a big reason as to why I would put my poor body through that experience.'\n\nAs for why Paul himself said yes to the grueling role? As he put it to AnOther Magazine in February, 'Gladiator 2 comes across your desk and there's no way you say no to it.'\n\nThe All of Us Strangers alum added, 'But with this scale of film, and to work with Ridley Scott, it's a no-brainer. Up until this point there have been very few larger films that remotely interested me.'\n\nPaul reflected, 'It feels really right. And also there's the capacity to learn. It's the first time that I've felt a pressure of, \"God, I'm worried about box office receipts.\" It's a different metric. But Ridley shoots at a very different rhythm - he's quick and it's kinetic and wonderful. He knows exactly what he wants. It honestly reminds me of sport in a way that is really satisfying.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Much anticipation has surrounded the sequel to the original movie of 2000 starring Russell Crowe, and now the release of the first trailer has ramped up the excitement another notch.\n\nThe film features Paul Mescal in the biggest role of his career so far as Lucius, the former heir to the Roman Empire who becomes a gladiator after living in estrangement for many years. When his home town is invaded by the Roman Army, led by General Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal) during the reign of co-emperors Caracalla and Geta, he vows to oppose their rule, inspired by the story of Maximus from the original film.\n\nConnie Nielsen reprises her role as Lucius' mother, Lucilla, while Denzel Washington plays Macrinus, a potentially manipulative tutor to Lucius, who keeps a stable of Gladiators. Elsewhere, the cast comprises Derek Jacobi, Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger, Tim McInnerny, and Alexander Karim.\n\nThe trailer sees Lucius claim that he remembers the day that Maximus fought and killed Joaquin Phoenix's Emperor Commodus, touching the legendary former Army General's suit of armour. Macrinus then admits that he will use the young gladiator as his \"instrument,\" with both characters expressing their desire to see Rome \"fall.\"\n\nThe Gladiator II trailer has moments of humour, particularly from Denzel Washington. However, they are largely overshadowed by intense scenes of dramatic dialogue and action-heavy set pieces in the gladiator's arena, in which Mescal and his fighting allies take up their swords to fight to the death.\n\nGladiator II has been in development for many years, but it was around 2021 that it began to gain traction as a genuine possibility. When Mescal, Pascal and Quinn were announced to have joined the cast in 2023, excitement began to grow for what may well be the most significant cinematic moment of the year, with the film set to be released on November 15th in the United Kingdom and November 22nd in the United States.\n\nRidley Scott had recently spoken of Mescal's casting and said that he was \"absolutely perfect\" for the role of Lucius. He told Vanity Fair, \"I met with him, and he said, 'Of course, I'd love to do it.' And that was it. We were away and running with the ball. He was a special find. He was absolutely perfect.\"", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_leatham@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Tom Leatham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Historical drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnus Maximus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macrinus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roman army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hechinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Hechinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_McInnerny", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim McInnerny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caracalla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucilla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Jacobi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derek Jacobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geta_(emperor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geta (emperor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/07/Gladiator-2-Paul-Mescal-Ridley-Scott-2024-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-15", "textStart": 2024, "textEnd": 2037}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-22", "textStart": 2064, "textEnd": 2077}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Russell Crowe is out and Paul Mescal is in, playing the grown son of Connie Nielsen's character from the first film, Lucius. In an epic journey that mirrors the one Crowe's Maximus went on in \"Gladiator,\" the sequel finds Mescal crossing paths with those who wronged him in the gladiatorial arena with an A-list ensemble that includes Pedro Pascal and Denzel Washington.\n\nDavid Scarpa, with whom Scott collaborated on his 2023 epic \"Napoleon\" and 2017 drama \"All the Money in the World,\" wrote the screenplay based on a story by Scarpa and Peter Craig.\n\nA sequel to \"Gladiator\" has been in the offing since the first film became a runaway hit, but while ideas were explored that would have followed Crowe's character into the afterlife (spoiler alert: he dies), a follow-up never materialized. That is, until Scott came back around to the idea in the last few years and decided to tell the story of what happened to young Lucius.\n\nOnce again set in Ancient Rome, the story of \"Gladiator II\" takes place years after witnessing the death of the revered hero Maximus at the hands of his uncle. Lucius is now forced to enter the Colosseum after his home is conquered by the tyrannical Emperors who lead Rome with an iron fist.

Flashbacks are then shown as a young Lucius Verus sees Maximus conquer his enemies in the arena.\n\n\"I remember that day -- I never forgot it,\" he said. \"That a slave could take revenge against an emperor.\"\n\nHe is explaining his unknown origins to Macrinus (Washington), who wants to use Lucius as an \"instrument.\"\n\nA beautiful aerial shot of the Colosseum is shown, which is filled with water. Glimpses of some of the events are shown as co-emperor Geta (Joseph Quinn) watches on, amused.\n\nShots of battles and Lucius training follow. Macrinus promises that he sees potential in Lucius that he wants to fulfill. \"That rage is your gift,\" he tells him.\n\nBy the halfway point of the trailer, Lucius has grown into a leadership role. He gives orders to his fellow warriors as they take on a bloodied rhinoceros.\n\nLater, when asked by Macrinus whose head would satisfy his fury, Lucius replies, \"The entire Roman army's.\"\n\nThat is too much, but he will settle for revenge against the general, Marcus Acacius (Pascal).\n\nTowards the end of the trailer, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), Lucius' mother, gifts him a ring worn by Maximus. \"What is the dram of Rome if our people are not free?\" she ponders.\n\nThe Gladiator 2 trailer concludes with Lucius and Marcus battling. A quick glimpse of Lucius beheading someone hits the screen before it officially ends.\n\nWhat is Gladiator 2 about?\n\nGladiator 2 takes place decades after the events of the first movie. Lucius, the grandson of Marcus Aurelius and son of Lucilla, has a quiet life with his wife and child. However, after Roman soldiers led by Marcus Acacius invade, he is forced into slavery.\n\nLike Maximus, Lucius has to fight his way to freedom as a gladiator. There are several forces pushing against him aside from Marcus, including young co-emperors Caracalla (Fred Hechinger) and Geta (Joseph Quinn).\n\nWhile Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, and Denzel Washington lead the cast, they are all new to the franchise. Connie Nielsen and Derek Jacobi will reprise their roles from the first movie.\n\nRidley Scott once again directs Gladiator 2. He directed the first movie based on a script from David Franzoni, John Logan, and Willian Nicholson. The sequel features a completely different writers' room, only consisting of David Scarpa.\n\nDespite being 86 years old, Scott continues going strong as a filmmaker. He first gained notoriety for directing Alien and Blade Runner. Since then, he has continued churning out movies at a rapid pace.\n\nOver the past decade, Scott has made eight movies, including Gladiator 2. These include 2021's double feature of The Last Duel and House of Gucci. His last movie -- Napoleon -- came out on November 22, 2023.\n\nGladiator remains one of Scott's biggest successes. Not only did it make over $460 million worldwide, the movie was up for 12 Oscars. It won five awards including Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I hate when studios use modern music.. or rap as the soundtrack for a trailer set in historic periods. It feels lazy to me. Anyway - check it out.'\n\n'Two things: 1. Hip hop doesn't match with ancient Rome. 2. Denzel is one of my favorite actors, but here sounds like Trainning day movie.'\n\n'Didn't like the Gladiator 2 trailer very much. Also, who's decision was it to have Kanye rapping in a GLADIATOR trailer.'\n\n'Oh no, they added hip hop music to the trailer #Gladiator2.'\n\n'Watched the #Gladiator2 trailer and I miss the Hans Zimmer music. Ahh well.'\n\n'The Kanye, Jay Z song spoiled that for me. I get it the lyrics are fitting but... Do you know what was iconic about the first gladiator... It's music. Absolute chilling to listen to, had a huge impact on the experience of the film.'\n\n'In what world does the sequel to Ridley Scott's Gladiator need Jay-Z and Kanye West? Stop shoehorning songs into trailers.'\n\nMovie buffs have taken to X (formerly Twitter ) to express their confusion at the artistic choice\n\n'Was not expecting to hear kanye in the Gladiator 2 trailer today.'\n\n'Visuals are incredible but the rap music destroys the suspension of disbelief. Whoever put that music in the trailer should be fired. And if that's the movie's soundtrack then the Gladiator franchise is finished.'\n\nHowever, not everyone disliked the unique choice and some people took to social media to praise it, adding:\n\n'Who would've imagined a Kanye/Jay Z song could go well with a Gladiator movie trailer?'\n\n'To anybody who says \"Why is there rap music in the GLADIATOR II trailer? It is anachronistic and does not suit the period\" 1. How do you know what suits the period? 2. Any instrument used to create the music would be anachronistic by default.'\n\n'I can smell critiques/jokes already, so I'm preemptively taking the stance that No Church in the Wild being used in the GLADIATOR II trailer is extremely sick and actually the perfect trailer song for a movie called GLADIATOR II.'\n\nIn the sequel to the popular movie, Russell Crow's legendary Maximus is long-since dead and buried, so it is Lucius - the grandson of Rome's former emperor Marcus Aurelius and son of Lucilla - who must fight for his liberty after being taken into slavery.\n\nA former heir to the

intent on following the lead set by Maximus by forcing his way out of the notorious fighting pits.\n\nAlong the way he encounters and befriends Macrinus, a power broker who keeps a stable of gladiators and sees battle-hungry Lucius as a promising investment.\n\nFans of the original film will remember that Lucius is also the nephew of Marcus' son Commodus, who famously killed his father to seize the throne.\n\nIn Gladiator, Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix, was killed while fighting Maximus, who save the young Lucius and his mother while avenging his own wife and son's death.\n\nThe long-awaited Gladiator sequel will debut 24 years after the original historical film was released to commercial and critical acclaim in 2000.\n\nAt the time, Gladiator won five Oscars from its 11

Roman soldiers led by general Marcus Acacius (Pascal) invade, forcing Lucius into slavery., Lucius then fights as a gladiator while opposing the rule of the young emperors.\n\nIt follows Scott's 2000 hit \"Gladiator,\" which starred Russell Crowe as Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who was betrayed when the emperor's jealous son murders his own father and seizes the throne, forcing Maximus to fight as a gladiator and avenge the murders of his family.\n\nThe film grossed more than $465 million worldwide and won Oscars for best picture, actor (Crowe), visual effects, sound and costume design. It also established Crowe as a mega-star leading man in Hollywood.\n\nCould the sequel send Mescal into a similar stratosphere. Already an Oscar nominee for his work in \"Aftersun,\" Mescal also previously starred in the series \"Normal People\" and in last year's critically acclaimed film \"All of Us Strangers.\"\n\nWashington appears to play a power broker and mentor figure to Mescal's Lucius, seemingly in a similar role to Oliver Reed's gruff gladiator trainer Antonius Proximo in the first film.\n\nAlong with \"Gladiator,\" Ridley Scott has also directed \"Alien,\" \"Blade Runner,\" \"Kingdom of Heaven,\" \"Black Hawk Down\" and 2023's \"Napoleon.\"\n\n\"Gladiator II\" opens in theaters everywhere Nov. 22, 2024.

His sword is planted in the ground as Lucius rubs sand between his hands.

This will offer the first official glimpses of the movie's action.\n\nAdditionally, official stills were shared. They are the same ones seen in Vanity Fair's cover story on the upcoming sequel. The marketing and promotion for the movie are just getting started over four months out from release.\n\nWhat is Gladiator 2 about?\n\nGladiator 2 picks up decades after the events of the first movie. Lucius is the grandson of Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielson). After being forced into slavery, he fights his way out and is opposed by co-emperors Caracalla (Joseph Quinn) and Geta (Fred Hechinger).\n\nWhile Oscar-nominated actor Paul Mescal leads the Gladiator 2 cast, the ensemble is star-studded. Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger, and May Calamawy will also star in the movie. Returning from the first one are Connie Nielsen and Derek Jacobi.\n\nRidley Scott directed the movie based on a script from David Scarpa. Paramount will release the movie in time for the Thanksgiving holiday on November 22, 2024.\n\nWhile Scott is 86 years old, he has not stopped making movies. He first gained notoriety for directing Alien, Blade Runner, Legend, and Thelma and Louise. Since 2014, he has made eight movies including Gladiator 2.\n\nGladiator 2 has big shoes to fill -- the first movie was a huge hit. It made over $460 million worldwide during its theatrical run on a $103 million budget.\n\nIt was also a major player at the Oscars. Gladiator was nominated for 12 Oscars and won five awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe.\n\nWho is Paul Mescal?\n\nPaul Mescal is an Oscar-nominated actor for his performance in Aftersun. He first gained notoriety for starring in the miniseries Normal People with Daisy Edgar-Jones. In the series, the two navigate adulthood during their final days of college.\n\nFor that performance, Mescal received an Emmy nomination and won a BAFTA TV Award. He subsequently starred in another miniseries, The Deceived, in 2020.\n\nOn the big screen, Mescal made his debut in Maggie Gyllenhaal's The Lost Daughter. He had a small role in the movie, which also featured Olivia Colman, Dakota Johnson, and Jessie Buckley. Mescal followed that up with roles in God's Creatures, Aftersun, and Carmen.\n\nHe starred as a single dad in Charlotte Wells' Aftersun alongside newcomer Frankie Corio. For the performance, Mescal landed a Best Actor Oscar nomination but ultimately lost to Brendan Fraser for his performance in The Whale.\n\n2023 was another big year for Mescal. He starred in All of Us Strangers with Adam Scott and then Foe with Saoirse Ronan. Gladiator 2 looks to further cement Mescal's place as a leading man in Hollywood.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Because this is what they believe in... power.\" Yes it is time. Paramount Pictures has finally unveiled the first official trailer for Ridley Scott's Gladiator II, his long-awaited sequel to the Oscar-winning classic Gladiator from 2000. This legacy sequel is actually a direct sequel to the original - following Lucius, the son of Maximus's love Lucilla, after Maximus's death, who ends up fighting in the Colosseum as well. This looks like a properly glorious sequel - even bigger (and hopefully better) with battles galore, involving water and a rhino and so much more. Starring Paul Mescal as Lucius (played by Spencer Treat Clark in the first movie), Denzel Washington as Macrinus, Pedro Pascal as the Emperoro Marcus Acacius, Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, plus Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger, Lior Raz, Peter Mensah, and Derek Jacobi. Even after a 24 year wait for this sequel, it does look like it might be as entertaining as the original - though I doubt it'll end up winning any Oscars. Only time will tell if it shall conquer! All this footage kicks ass - especially every scene with Denzel. Fire it up below and enjoy the show.\n\nDecades after the events of Gladiator, Lucius -- the grandson of Rome's former emperor Marcus Aurelius & son of Lucilla -- lives with his wife and child in Numidia. Roman soldiers led by general Marcus Acacius invade, forcing Lucius into slavery. Inspired by Maximus, Lucius will fight as a gladiator while opposing the rule of the young emperors Caracalla and Geta. Gladiator II is once again directed by acclaimed British filmmaker Ridley Scott, director of many amazing movies including Alien, Prometheus, Alien: Covenant, The Martian, Gladiator, Robin Hood, American Gangster, The Counselor, Matchstick Men, Blade Runner, Black Hawk Down, Kingdom of Heaven, Legend, Exodus: Gods and Kings, All the Money in the World, The Last Duel, House of Gucci, and Napoleon previously. The screenplay is written by David Scarpa; based on characters created by David Franzoni, John Logan, William Nicholson. Produced by Ridley Scott, Michael Pruss, Douglas Wick, Lucy Fisher, Walter F. Parkes, Laurie MacDonald, David Franzoni. Made by Scott Free Productions, Red Wagon Entertainment, P+M Image Nation. Paramount will debut Scott's Gladiator 2 in theaters nationwide starting on November 22nd, 2024 this fall, just before Thanksgiving.

While Gladiator may play fast and loose with historical facts, it offers a heart-breaking story, bigger-than-life characters, and a genuinely captivating spectacle (something Scott's Napoleon movie failed to achieve).\n\nNearly twenty-five years after the film premiere, Scott will take viewers back to the sandy arenas of Rome. In Gladiator 2, we won't see Russell Crowe or Joaquin Phoenix, stars of the original film. But don't worry - they have worthy successors.\n\nPaul Mescal will play Lucius, now grown-up nephew of Emperor Commodus from the original Gladiator. He will be accompanied by Pedro Pascal as General Marcus Acacius, Joseph Quinn as Emperor Geta, Fred Hechinger as Emperor Caracalla and Denzel Washington as Macrinus. Connie Nielsen will return as Lucius' mother, Lucilla, while Derek Jacobi will again play Senator Gracchus.\n\nThanks to the first photos published by Vanity Fair, you can get a sneak peek of the upcoming film:\n\nIf you want to know when to book tickets for the film, keep on reading.\n\nThe new Ridley Scott movie will premiere in the UK on Friday, 15 November 2024. The long-awaited film is already creating quite a buzz, so the tickets will likely be available for booking at least a month before the opening day.\n\nUS\n\nGladiator 2 will debut in the US on Friday, 22 November 2024. It will be one of the biggest premieres this fall, but not the only one. The movie will compete fiercely with Wicked, which will debut in cinemas on the same day.\n\nAccording to Vanity Fair, it can create a situation similar to the Barbenheimer case when the same release date for Barbie and Oppenheimer pumps up the hype for both movies.\n\nWithout fail, the creators of the Gladiator 2 want to gain as much advantage as they can over their rivals. Thus, the tickets for Ridley Scott's movie will probably go on sale several weeks before the film's release.\n\nTickets will be available from all the major cinema chains in the US and UK:", "source": {"uri": "techadvisor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tech Advisor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "weronika_de_oliveira@techadvisor.com", "name": "Weronika De Oliveira", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Napoleon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ancient history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hechinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Hechinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius_Gracchus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiberius Gracchus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caracalla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macrinus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Jacobi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derek Jacobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roman emperor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppenheimer_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oppenheimer (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barbie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.techadvisor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gladiator-2-Paul-Mescal.jpg?quality=50&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Much like the original film, Gladiator 2 seems to have put a lot of effort and money into building huge sets to make it all feel as real as possible instead of just going with a huge CGI arena. That's all great, but one question remains: what is this movie even going to be about?\n\nAs you likely know by now, and without venturing into spoiler territory, the original Gladiator tells the beginning middle and end of a story, not leaving much room for a direct sequel. So, Gladiator 2 will take place a few decades after the original and follow Lucius, the now-grown son of the Emperor's sister who was Maximus' fan in the first film.\n\nAs revealed in a Vanity Fair piece, we know that Paul Mescal's Lucius departed Rome shortly after the events of the first film. He was living a calm life away from the troubles and venom of Roman nobility until he got captured by Pedro Pascal's Marcus Acacius, a new Roman general who used to serve under Maximus and who's unaware that he's capturing his wife's son. After his capture, Lucius will naturally end up fending for himself in wilder-than-ever gladiatorial arenas, and Denzel Washington will likely play a role similar to that of Oliver Reed's Proximo, Maximus' owner/manager in the first movie.\n\nThough the main conflict seems to revolve around the first two, they will also have to deal with Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger, who'll be playing a duo of new evil Emperor siblings that the trailer effortlessly sells as detestable, like Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus from the original. Everyone will be joined by Connie Nielsen reprising her role as Lucilla, the mother of Lucius.\n\nGladiator 2 is set to release on November 22.

We get a good look at Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius, too, and the Colosseum in all its glory. There's plenty of action, too, with large-scale battles and arena fights. The trailer teases a fight between Lucius and a gladiator riding a rhino, and Marcus Acacius taking on a handful of enemies on his own. It ends with a fight between Lucius and Marcus Acacius, with Rome the setting of an uprising.\n\nIt's the most substantial look we've gotten at the long-awaited sequel, following a batch of photos that debuted in Vanity Fair earlier this month. Prior to that, only attendees of CinemaCon got a peek at a few minutes of action-packed footage behind closed doors in April (read IGN's breakdown of the footage here).\n\nGladiator 2 features a star-studded new cast including Paul Mescal as Lucius Verus, Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius, Denzel Washington as Macrinus, and Joseph Quinn as Geta, with Connie Nielsen returning as Lucilla, the mother of Lucius. One star we know won't be returning, however, is the original's Russell Crowe, who's insisted that the sequel \"has nothing to do with me\" and his deceased character Maximus.\n\nGladiator 2 is set several years after the events of the first film, and will find an all-grown-up Lucius as he's forced into slavery, despite being the former heir to the Roman Empire. Not unlike Maximus, we'll see him enter hit the sandy arena as a gladiator as he opposes the rule of Caracalla (Fred Hechinger) and Geta.\n\nGladiator 2 will hit theaters on November 22 (going head-to-head with Wicked, no less).", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_(praenomen)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucius (praenomen)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Verus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucius Verus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macrinus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colosseum"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IGN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hechinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Hechinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magnus Maximus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caracalla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucilla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geta_(emperor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geta (emperor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Laser_Games/LaZerware", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Laser Games/LaZerware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/09/rhino-1720530691710.png?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-22", "textStart": 1809, "textEnd": 1820}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Check it out here...\n\nThe first poster for Gladiator II has been released and with that comes confirmation a trailer is set to follow tomorrow. While a handful of stills recently offered a sneak peek at what's to come, fans of Sir Ridley Scott's 2000 classic have been eager to see footage for some time now.\n\nThe sequel centres around Paul Mescal's Lucius, the son of Connie Nielsen's Lucilla. Decades have passed and he's come of age far away from his mother after she sent him to the northern coast of Africa to escape the reaches of the Roman Empire.\n\nHe's grown up resenting his mother (not understanding she had good reason for sending him away) but now has a peaceful life with a wife and child of his own...until the Romans invade. As a result, he soon finds himself competing in the arena we once saw Maximus fight in.\n\nMescal's breakthrough performance was in Normal People; however, Gladiator II will likely be the movie that puts him on the map.\n\nDuring a recent interview, he reflected on first meeting with Scott. \"We spoke for about 20 to 30 minutes. I wanted to get a flavor from him about what the story was going to be about, so we spent about 15 minutes talking about that, and then we spent another 10 minutes talking about the sport that I played growing up - Gaelic football.\"\n\n\"Maybe that was something that helped with it, in that I'm used to being physical in my body. My memory of it is that probably two or three weeks later, the offer came in.\"\n\nAs for his physical transformation, Mescal said, \"I just wanted to be big and strong and look like somebody who can cause a bit of damage when shit hits the fan. I think also, sometimes, one could, in striving for that perfect look, end up looking more like an underwear model than a warrior.\"\n\n\"Muscles start to grow, and that can be deemed aesthetic in certain capacities, but there is something about feeling strong in your body that elicits just a different feeling,\" the actor continued. \"You carry yourself differently. It has an impact on you psychologically in a way that is useful for the film.\"\n\nBased on characters by David Franzoni and a story by Peter Craig and David Scarpa, Ridley Scott directs Gladiator II from a script by Scarpa.

The promo comes following yesterday's poster debut and boy does this look good.\n\nThe film is obviously the follow-up to Rodney Scott's Oscar-winning Gladiator which was released all of the way back in 2000. Gladiator II comes to cinema screens through Paramount Pictures and is produced by Douglas Wick, Ridley Scott, Lucy Fisher, Michael Pruss, and David Franzoni. David Scarpa wrote the screenplay based on characters created by David Franzoni. The story is by Peter Craig and David Scarpa.\n\nNo Russell Crowe this time around, but Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger, Lior Raz, Derek Jacobi, Connie Nielsen and Denzel Washington line up among the impressive cast.\n\nGladiator, the striking original led by Crowe garnered no less than five Oscar wins, including one for its main actor. It also scored Best Picture as well as taking $465.4 million worldwide during its run. That movie had a reported budget of around $103 million but this new one is considerably more.\n\nThe new one (as per the IMDB) follows Lucius (played by Mescal), the son of Maximus's love Lucilla, after Maximus's death.\n\nFilming has taken place in the UK, Morocco, Malta (where the first movie was shot) and most recently at South Downs at Devil's Dyke, Sussex. Mescal was spotted on set filming scenes for the movie.\n\nFootage from the film was screened at CinemaCon in Las Vegas earlier this year with the crowds lapping up what was on display.

The film will see grown-up Lucius returning to Rome as a gladiator, where he makes new enemies and reunites with his mother.\n\nAlongside Paul Mescal in the role of Lucius, The Last of Us' Pedro Pascal has also been cast as Marcus Acacius, a Roman general who trained under Maximus. Meanwhile, Denzel Washington plays Macrinus, a \"power broker\" who keeps a stable of gladiators.\n\nRounding out the cast will be Connie Nielsen, who is reprising her role as Lucius' mother Lucilla. Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn will play Emperor Caracalla, while Saltburn's Barry Keoghan will portray Emperor Gata.\n\nFollowing the trailer's release, many fans have been taking to social media to express their thoughts so far.\n\n\"This is going to be the movie of the year!!\" one fan commented on Instagram.\n\n\"Omg!!! THIS CAST!!!!!! This looks well worth the wait!!!\" another exclaimed.\n\n\"Joseph Quinn and Paul Mescal are becoming movie stars,\" a third fan praised.\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair, Paul Mescal recently admitted that he was offered the part after just one 30 minute chat with director Ridley Scott.\n\n\"I wanted to get a flavour from him about what the story was going to be about, so we spent about 15 minutes talking about that, and then we spent another 10 minutes talking about the sport that I played growing up -- Gaelic football,\" he recalled.\n\n\"My nose is kind of Roman, so it's useful in this context. The nose that I absolutely hated when I was in secondary school -- and used to get ribbed for -- became very, very useful when Ridley needed somebody to be in Gladiator II,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "shemazing.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "SHEmazing!"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_costello@shemazing.net", "name": "Emma Costello", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_People_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Normal People (miniseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magnus Maximus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caracalla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macrinus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Last of Us"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roman emperor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Keoghan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barry Keoghan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

Mescal's love of sport and physicality from his past helped him in the role, but Scott knew he was right for it almost immediately. Co-star Pedro Pascal nicknamed Mescal \"Brick Wall Paul\" due to his strength, saying that he dreaded fight scenes with him.\n\nPaul Mescal is known for appearing in emotional, heartbreaking roles, and it was one of his earliest hits that led Ridley Scott to cast him in the upcoming Gladiator II. Mescal has had an amazing last few years, appearing in Charlotte Wells' devastating Aftersun, and Andrew Haigh's mind-bending and heart-tugging All of Us Strangers. But before appearing in those critically acclaimed movies, Mescal co-starred with Daisy Edgar-Jones in the miniseries Normal People, based on the novel by Sally Rooney.\n\nSurprisingly, it was that role as an anxious young adult struggling with life and love in Ireland that helped Mescal become the new face of 2024's biggest action movie. Speaking to Vanity Fair, director Ridley Scott revealed how he discovered Mescal's acting talents. The director said that he's always hunting for new talent whenever he's watching a new movie or TV show. The BBC Three and Hulu adaptation of Sally Rooney's best-selling novel is a far cry from the sword and sandals, blood-flowing spectacles of the Roman Colosseum, but Scott knew he'd found his leading man when watching the series. The director said:\n\n\"When I watch anything, I tend to be clocking who's interesting. It's just in my DNA. And so, watching a TV show that's not really my kind of TV show, almost four years ago, I said, 'Who's this guy?' I met with him, and he said, 'Of course, I'd love to do it.' And that was it. We were away and running with the ball. He was a special find. He was absolutely perfect .\"\n\n1 Image 1 Image Close Gladiator II DramaActionAdventure Release Date November 22, 2024 Director Ridley Scott Cast Pedro Pascal , Connie Nielsen , Denzel Washington , Paul Mescal , Joseph Quinn , Djimon Hounsou Main Genre Action Paul Mescal's Love of Sport Helped Him Land the Role in Gladiator 2 Close\n\nMaking the move from Mescal's romantic, emotional roles to a major franchise meant that the actor had to transform his body to convincingly play a Roman gladiator. But physicality isn't anything new for Mescal. Mescal added to Ridley Scott's story of how he was cast, and revealed that his love of sport as a child and teenager helped him land the role of a violent warrior. The actor also revealed that he wasn't required to camera test for the role, as Ridley Scott had already decided he was the actor for the role. Mescal said:\n\n\" We spoke for about 20 to 30 minutes . I wanted to get a flavor from him about what the story was going to be about, so we spent about 15 minutes talking about that, and then we spent another 10 minutes talking about the sport that I played growing up -- Gaelic football. Maybe that was something that helped with it, in that I'm used to being physical in my body . My memory of it is that probably two or three weeks later, the offer came in.\"\n\nRelated Wickedator Weekend is on, Wicked Gets Earlier Release Date in Direct Competition With Gladiator 2\n\nWicked has avoided a direct challenge from Moana 2, but instead sets up this year's Barbenheimer double-header.\n\nMescal gained so much muscle and strength for the role that his co-star, Pedro Pascal, bestowed him with a new nickname, \"Brick Wall Paul.\" Aided by his background in Gaelic Football -- an Irish blend of soccer and rugby -- Paul Mescal frightened Pascal during their fight scenes. Pascal explained:\n\nIt's brutal, man. I call him Brick Wall Paul. He got so strong.

It was directed by Ridley Scott, and starred Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, the late Richard Harris, and Oliver Reed in his final performance before he died in 1999. The film made $465 million worldwide, won five Oscars (including Best Actor for Crowe and Best Picture), and became an obsession for Ralph Cifaretto on The Sopranos before he was beaten and strangled to death in his own kitchen by Tony Soprano. (A not-entirely-fun fact: Gladiator was the first movie I ever bought on DVD, along with my very first DVD player. Rest in peace, Circuit City.)\n\nTwenty-four years later, its long-awaited sequel is about to open in theaters (and on the same day as Wicked: Part One, no less), with the trailer for Gladiator II premiering online earlier today, and Ridley Scott back in the director's chair.\n\nOver two decades after the events of Gladiator, Lucius -- the grandson of Rome's former emperor Marcus Aurelius (Harris) and son of Lucilla (Nielsen) -- lives with his wife and child in Numidia. Roman soldiers led by general Marcus Acacius (played by Pedro Pascal) invade, forcing Lucius into slavery. Inspired by the story of Maximus, as depicted in the original 2000 film, Lucius (played by Paul Mescal) resolves to fight as a gladiator while opposing the rule of the young emperors Caracalla and Geta (played by Fred Hechinger and Joseph Quinn).\n\nGladiator II, starring Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, Connie Nielsen, and Denzel Washington, opens in theaters on November 22. For a more in-depth look at the making of the film, check out Anthony Breznican's article on Vanity Fair, which can be read here.\n\nAnd yes, Pedro Pascal and Joseph Quinn will appear onscreen together next year as Reed Richards, a.k.a. Mister Fantastic, and Johnny Storm, a.k.a. the Human Torch, in The Fantastic Four, which opens in theaters on July 25.", "source": {"uri": "pajiba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pajiba"},

In an age where revenge pics were a dime a dozen, Ridley Scott's 2000 masterpiece made a familiar premise feel visceral and real again. It helped that Scott was also taking a gutsier approach to the sword-and-sandals films that once dominated the multiplex. In many ways, Gladiator represented the genre's peak, and it still hasn't really been topped. But leave it to Scott, 24 years later, to take a swing at a follow-up.\n\n\"Legacyquels\" have become a staple of modern Hollywood, so it was only a matter of time before someone tried to build on the world of Gladiator. Hopefully, with Scott at the helm, Gladiator II won't be just another empty cash grab. There are loose connections to the original film starring Russell Crowe, along with a few returning cast members, and it also echos Gladiator's tale of vengeance and redemption. But with fresh blood in the form of Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, Denzel Washington, and Joseph Quinn, Gladiator II could provide a refreshingly modern take on the classic genre.\n\nAppropriately set a few decades after Gladiator, Gladiator II tells the story of Lucius (Mescal), a warrior who shapes himself into an instrument of revenge. He's the son of the Roman noblewoman Lucilla (Connie Nielsen, reprising her original role), and he might also be the son of Crowe's Maximus. No one knows for sure, especially since he grew up miles away from the Roman empire and built a life for himself in relative peace. But in an echo of the original Gladiator, that's quickly thwarted by an attack from Roman forces.\n\nLucius becomes a prisoner, then a gladiator determined to tear down the system that destroyed his life. With the help of a charming power broker (Washington), Lucius will challenge the Roman general (Pascal) who led the invasion of his hometown.

Paul Mescal (Normal People; Aftersun; The Lost Daughter) stars as Lucius, squaring off against 3x Primetime Emmy-nominee Pedro Pascal (The Mandalorian; Game of Thrones; Narcos) and Academy Award-winner Denzel Washington (Training Day; Fences; Malcolm X).\n\nAs per the official synopsis, \"Gladiator II continues the epic saga of power, intrigue, and vengeance set in Ancient Rome. Years after witnessing the death of the revered hero Maximus at the hands of his uncle, Lucius (Paul Mescal) is forced to enter the Colosseum after his home is conquered by the tyrannical Emperors who now lead Rome with an iron fist. With rage in his heart and the future of the Empire at stake, Lucius must look to his past to find strength and honor to return the glory of Rome to its people.\"\n\nRidley Scott returns to direct this highly anticipated sequel to his blockbuster film Gladiator, which starred Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius and Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. The original Gladiator, released in 2000, grossed over $465.4 million globally on a production budget of approximately $100 million. It won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and is frequently regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made. Given this legacy, the sequel certainly has high expectations to meet.\n\nIn addition to the lead roles by Mescal, Pascal, and Washington, the supporting cast is equally star-studded. Connie Nielsen (Wonder Woman; Gladiator; The Devil's Advocate) reprises her role as Lucilla. Other notable cast members include Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things; Catherine the Great; Overlord), Fred Hechinger (The White Lotus; Fear Street Part One: 1994; News of the World), Derek Jacobi (I, Claudius; Gladiator; The King's Speech), Tim McInnerny (Blackadder; Notting Hill; Eddie the Eagle), Alexander Karim (Tyrant; The Lawyer; Zero Dark Thirty), Lior Raz (Fauda; 6 Underground; Mary Magdalene), Peter Mensah (300; Avatar; Spartacus: Blood and Sand), Matt Lucas (Little Britain; Bridesmaids; Alice in Wonderland), and May Calamawy (Ramy; Moon Knight; The Long Road Home).\n\nThe trailer showcases the grand scale of the film, with epic battles, stunning visuals, and intense performances from the cast. Ridley Scott's return to this universe is highly anticipated, as he brings his unique vision and storytelling prowess back to the gladiatorial arenas of Ancient Rome.\n\nFans of the original film and newcomers alike will be eagerly awaiting the release of Gladiator II, which promises to deliver a compelling and visually spectacular continuation of the saga.

In addition to the film's first images, another headline made musical lovers even more pumped to know that Wicked will arrive on the big screen a few days earlier. Other major news stories that came out include updates on Now You See Me 3, as well as potential guest appearances from the newly-appointed Fantastic Four at an upcoming event. To keep you in the loop on what is happening in the film world, here is a detailed breakdown of all the big announcements that came out this week.\n\nMonday\n\n'Gladiator II' First Images Take Paul Mescal to the Colosseum\n\nAfter much anticipation, Vanity Fair gave a generous first look at Gladiator II early this week. The outlet shared several images of the main cast at the Colosseum, including a shot featuring an intense sword fight between Paul Mescal and Pedro Pascal. The Normal People alum will be the main warrior in the upcoming sequel, playing Commodus' nephew Lucius. Other cast members who are also part of the ensemble include Denzel Washington, Joseph Quinn, and Connie Nielsen. According to Ridley Scott, the film's identity will be shaped by the OG installment's legacy, honoring Maximus (Russell Crowe) 20 years after his tragic death. As reported last month, Gladiator II will be arriving internationally on November 15 and in North America on November 22.\n\nRelated\n\nPaul Mescal and Pedro Pascal Clash in First 'Gladiator II' Images\n\nPaul Mescal and Pedro Pascal are sweaty and bloody in the first images from Ridley Scott's highly-anticipated sequel.\n\n'Wicked' and 'Gladiator II' Hope To Spark a New Barbenheimer This November\n\nClose\n\nA surprise announcement about Wicked's theatrical premiere was made this week, informing us that it would arrive sooner than expected. Originally set to come out on November 27 (alongside Moana 2), the movie's release date changed to November 22, becoming the main competitor to Gladiator II at the box office. Several people believe that these two titles arriving on the big screen on the same day could lead to another \"Barbenheimer\" moment, with fans lining up to watch one or the other (or even both). The film based on the beloved Broadway musical is directed by Jon M. Chu (responsible for In the Heights and Crazy Rich Asians) and has Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo playing Galenda and Elphaba, two very different witches who are close at first but have a major fallout when one of them takes a dark turn.\n\nRelated\n\n'Wicked' Gets in the Arena With 'Gladiator II' With New Release Date\n\nAre you not entertained?\n\n'The Fantastic Four' In Talks to Make Guest Appearance at the San Diego Comic-Con\n\nAfter SDCC posters surfaced online showing Pedro Pascal and Joseph Quinn as Mr. Fantastic and Human Torch, it is very probable that The Fantastic Four cast might be making their official debut at the event. The reboot will commence filming on July 29, a day after San Diego Comic-Con is over, meaning that the likelihood of the actors making a quick stop at the convention is big. The news about the cast's attendance hasn't been confirmed yet, but there are high chances that Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige might introduce them as the new faces taking on the beloved comic book superheroes. In addition to Pascal and Quinn, Vanessa Kirby and Ebon Moss-Bachrach will play Invisible Woman and The Thing.\n\nRelated\n\nAre The Fantastic Four Coming to San Diego Comic Con?\n\nSDCC 2024 begins on July 25.\n\nTi West Is Open to Expand 'X' Franchise After 'Maxxxine'\n\nAlthough Maxxxine has been marketed as the final chapter of the X franchise, Ti West is still pondering whether to make more sequels and spinoffs related to the horror trilogy. In a recent interview with Collider's own Perri Nemiroff, the director brought fans hope by hinting that Maxine (played by Mia Goth) hasn't finished her spree yet. When asked about the promo for the film alluding to the end of the franchise, West simply responded that he \"didn't make the trailers\", which clearly shows he is still very optimistic about continuing to venture into this universe. When adding the finishing touches to the third installment, he discussed that he already has an idea for another film if number 3 has a positive reception:\n\n\" There is this one weird idea that I have that is kind of ... if I explained it, it would make sense. But we'll see what happens. Let's get this movie done first, see if people like it. Then we'll go from there.\"\n\nIn her interview with Nemiroff, Maxxxine star Lily Collins also expressed her desire to go back on set for a fourth movie, which is also assuring.\n\nRelated\n\nThe 'MaXXXine' Trailers Have Lied to You -- Ti West Is Still Game for a Fourth Film\n\nThe filmmaker may not be done with Mia Goth's titular slasher just yet.\n\nTuesday\n\n'Now You See Me 3' Coming Out Next Year With Even More Magic Tricks\n\nThe Four Horsemen have a lot more tricks up their sleeves, and Now You See Me 3 will see them orchestrating another heist-meets-illusion show. Lionsgate announced this week that the film is expected to arrive in theaters on November 14, 2025. Although plot details are currently under wraps, it has already been confirmed that Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, and Morgan Freeman will all be back for the upcoming sequel. In addition to the returning cast, the third installment will also introduce a new group of magicians, with Justice Smith, Dominic Sessa, Ariana Greenblatt, and Rosamund Pike playing them onscreen.\n\nRelated\n\n'Now You See Me 3' Just Got a Massive Update\n\nJesse Eisenberg is set to return for the threequel next year.\n\nWednesday\n\nPeter Jackson Finally Revealed What 'Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum' Is About\n\nAfter The Lord of the Rings trilogy garnered a massive following over the years, Peter Jackson is returning to the franchise as the producer of the upcoming prequel The Hunt of Gollum. This week, the renowned filmmaker gave further insight into what fans can expect from the movie, sharing that it will be less about epic battles and more about understanding Gollum's mind. The project will serve as an origin story for the character, and it will further examine the differences between him and Sm\u00e9agol. Here is what he had to say about the plot:\n\n\"The Gollum/Sm\u00e9agol character has always fascinated me because Gollum reflects the worst of human nature, whilst his Sm\u00e9agol side is, arguably, quite sympathetic. I think he connects with readers and film audiences alike, because there's a little bit of both of them in all of us. We really want to explore his backstory and delve into those parts of his journey we didn't have time to cover in the earlier films. It's too soon to know who will cross his path, but suffice to say we will take our lead from Professor Tolkien.\"\n\nRelated\n\nPeter Jackson Reveals Major Plot Details For 'The Lord of the Rings: The Hunt For Gollum'\n\n\"I think he connects with readers and film audiences alike.\"\n\nThursday\n\n'Avatar 4' Begins Shooting and Sets Release Date For Years From Now\n\nJames Cameron is adding another sequel to the Avatar franchise, and although it is only coming out in 2029 (yes, a few years from now), it is exciting to know that the film has begun shooting. The update was shared by Joel David Moore through his Instagram handle. The actor who plays Norm Spellman in the sci-fi franchise said in the post's caption that he is back in New Zealand and that being in the country feels nostalgic to him since he has been heading there for the past 17 years working on the Avatar films.

The character idolized Maximus. Oscar winner Crowe who played the character confirmed he is not part of the sequel since Maximus died in the original movie.\n\n\"Stranger Things\" star Joseph Quinn plays the new Caesar deciding the fate of the warriors, while Pedro Pascal is a general and Denzel Washington is a power broker. A teaser of the film's footage screened at CinemaCon. Mescal was shown as a slave battling primates in games inside the Colosseum. Mescal also goes up against Pascal onscreen.\n\nMescal, who previously admitted that he was \"stressed\" about leading the sequel, recently told Vanity Fair that the feature really is about the lengths society will go to to be immortal.\n\n\"What human beings will do to survive, but also what human beings will do to win,\" Mescal said. \"We see that in the arena, but also in the political struggle that's going on outside of my character's storyline, where you see there's other characters striving and pulling for power. Where's the space for humanity? Where's the space for love, familial connection? And ultimately, will those things overcome this kind of greed and power? Those things are oftentimes directly in conflict with each other.\"\n\nMescal continued of his character specifically, \"It's very 'angry young man' drama in that sense. He can see the way Rome has kind of fallen in on itself. Rome represents all the personal neglect that he felt as a child. Suddenly he's thrust back into that world and has direct proximity to all of the things that he thinks he hates and doesn't feel attached to anymore.\"\n\nScott teased that the film is \"pretty gnarly\" both in its action scenes and historical context.\n\nThe Paramount Pictures sequel is written by Scott's \"Napoleon\" screenwriter David Scarpa. Original \"Gladiator\" collaborators, costume designer Janty Yates and production designer Arthur Max, are returning along with director-producer Scott. Scott Free President Michael Pruss, plus Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher via Red Wagon Entertainment, are also producing.\n\nDirector Scott recreated the original film's sets in Malta in the exact same spot where they shot the first feature. According to actor Quinn, Scott would film with eight cameras at once for just a single scene. Quinn told IndieWire that working with auteur Scott was \"life affirming, amazing, and beyond anything I could've imagined.\"\n\n\"Gladiator 2\" premieres November 22 in theaters.

Decades have passed and he's come of age far away from his mother after she sent him to the northern coast of Africa to escape the reaches of the Roman Empire.\n\nHe's grown up resenting his mother - not understanding she had good reason for sending him away - but now has a peaceful life with a wife and child of his own...until the Romans invade. As a result, he soon finds himself competing in the arena we once saw Maximus fight in.\n\nMescal's breakthrough performance was in Normal People; however, Gladiator II will likely be the movie that puts him on the map.\n\nDuring a recent interview, he reflected on first meeting with Scott. \"We spoke for about 20 to 30 minutes. I wanted to get a flavor from him about what the story was going to be about, so we spent about 15 minutes talking about that, and then we spent another 10 minutes talking about the sport that I played growing up - Gaelic football.\"\n\n\"Maybe that was something that helped with it, in that I'm used to being physical in my body. My memory of it is that probably two or three weeks later, the offer came in.\"\n\nAs for his physical transformation, Mescal said, \"I just wanted to be big and strong and look like somebody who can cause a bit of damage when shit hits the fan. I think also, sometimes, one could, in striving for that perfect look, end up looking more like an underwear model than a warrior.\"\n\n\"Muscles start to grow, and that can be deemed aesthetic in certain capacities, but there is something about feeling strong in your body that elicits just a different feeling,\" the actor continued. \"You carry yourself differently. It has an impact on you psychologically in a way that is useful for the film.\"\n\nBased on characters by David Franzoni and a story by Peter Craig and David Scarpa, Ridley Scott directs Gladiator II from a script by Scarpa.

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\n24 years after the original film, Paramount Pictures finally unveiled the first trailer for Ridley Scott's Gladiator 2 on Tuesday, just months ahead of its November release date.\n\nThe trailer kicks off with Paul Mescal's Lucius Verus calling back to the first film, with Denzel Washington's Macrinus pulling the strings. We get a good look at Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius, too, and the Colosseum in all its glory. There's plenty of action, with large-scale battles and arena fights. The trailer teases a fight between Lucius and a gladiator riding a rhino, and Marcus Acacius taking on a handful of enemies on his own. The clip ends on a fight between Lucius and Marcus Acacius, with Rome the setting of an uprising.\n\nIt's the most substantial look we've gotten at the long-awaited sequel, following a batch of photos that debuted in Vanity Fair earlier this month. Prior to that, only attendees of CinemaCon got a peek at a few minutes of action-packed footage behind closed doors in April (read IGN's breakdown of the footage here).\n\nGladiator 2 features a star-studded new cast including Paul Mescal as Lucius Verus, Pedro Pascal as Marcus Acacius, Denzel Washington as Macrinus, and Joseph Quinn as Geta, with Connie Nielsen returning as Lucilla, the mother of Lucius. One star we know won't be returning, however, is the original's Russell Crowe, who's insisted that the sequel \"has nothing to do with me\" and his deceased character Maximus.\n\nGladiator 2 is set several years after the events of the first film, and will find an all-grown-up Lucius as he's forced into slavery, despite being the former heir to the Roman Empire. Not unlike Maximus, we'll see him enter hit the sandy arena as a gladiator as he opposes the rule of Caracalla (Fred Hechinger) and Geta.\n\nGladiator 2 will hit theaters on November 22 (going head-to-head with Wicked, no less).\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Though Lucius can vividly recall some moments from his childhood, his memories of his mother Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) seem to have faded by the time he's crossed paths with power broker Macrinus (Denzel Washington).\n\nAs a man who deals in weapons and warriors, Macrinus can see great potential in Lucius as he watches him take on a rhino in the Coliseum. But as skilled as Lucius is at killing animals, what he truly wants is to take down Rome itself -- or at least its new leaders, Emperor Geta (Joseph Quinn), Emperor Caracalla (Fred Hechinger), and General Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal).\n\nBetween the sand-throwing, roaring crowds, and knock-down, drag-out battles, the trailer makes Gladiator II look like exactly what fans of the first film have been yearning for.

Lucius is the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and nephew of Commodus, who was originally played by Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nThe plot follows Lucius, who witnessed the death of Maximus (Crowe) as a child at the hands of his uncle.\n\nHe was then sent by his mother as a child to live on the northern coast of Africa to shield him from the corruption and violence of Rome.\n\nAs an adult, he gets thrown back into Roman life and into captivity after his home is conquered by General Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal) and his forces who lead Rome with an iron fist.\n\nLucius is then forced into the Colosseum to battle, where he must fight for the future of the Roman people.\n\nThe trailer also introduces Denzel Washington as Macrinus, who is a wealthy arms dealer entangled in the spectacle of gladiators and the film's two main antagonists: twin emperors Caracalla (Fred Hechinger) and Geta (Joseph Quinn).\n\nDerek Jacobi is reprising his role as Gracchus, while May Calamawy, Lior Raz, Peter Mensah AND Matt Lucas round out the star-studded cast.\n\nScott, 86, returns to direct the follow-up to his award-winning \"Gladiator,\" and he brings along a seasoned team, such as cinematographer John Mathieson, production designer Arthur Max, and costume designer Janty Yates.\n\nThe original won five Oscars and grossed $465.4 million worldwide, becoming the second highest-grossing film of that year.\n\nMescal, 28, reflected on the project during an interview with Entertainment Tonight in July.\n\n\"It's an immense honor -- it's not lost on me,\" he said at the time. \"That film is hugely important to a lot of people across the world. And for the great Ridley Scott to kind of pass the baton on to me is something that, like, my drama school self or even the version of myself that was 15 watching the film for the first time, could never have imagined.\"\n\nThe \"Normal People\" actor said he took on the role as Lucius with a \"great deal of pride.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of work that went into it,\" he went on of his transformation. \"Lots of lifting heavy things... lots of squatting, pushing, pulling. We didn't kind of change the wheel with it, it was all kind of pretty standard in that regard, but I was keen for it not to look false or kind of overly aesthetic in any way.\"\n\nPascal, 49, meanwhile, called his co-star \"Brick Wall Paul.\"\n\n\"It's brutal, man,\" he told Vanity Fair that same month. \"He got so strong. I would rather be thrown from a building than have to fight him again. To go up against somebody that fit and that talented and that much younger.... Outside of Ridley being a total genius, Paul is a big reason as to why I would put my poor body through that experience.\"\n\nMescal said the entire experience overall was a \"pivotal\" moment for him.\n\n\"I think for a lot of us, especially the younger cohort of the cast, we would easily say that it's a job that changed our lives,\" he marveled.\n\n\"We're kind of waiting with bated breath, but the thing that I keep coming back to is, we've done it. We've gone and made it and nobody can take that away from us. And we had the king that is Ridley Scott at the helm -- it's amazing.\"\n\nThe \"All of Us Strangers\" star said the \"Roman\" nose he hated all his life is also what helped him get the role.\n\n\"My nose just is kind of Roman,\" Mescal told Vanity Fair. \"So it's useful in this context. The nose that I absolutely hated when I was in secondary school -- and used to get ribbed for -- became very, very useful when Ridley needed somebody to be in Gladiator II.\"\n\n\"I remember watching it with my dad and being absolutely blown away by it,\" he told ET of his admiration for the original film.\n\n\"It's been in the cultural zeitgeist for 20 years, and there's not a lot of films that have done that especially in this genre,\" he added. \"So there's a healthy amount of pressure but also a healthy amount of confidence from the people that made the film. We are excited to kind of add the next installment to a film that has been and will continue to be incredibly popular.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York

It's been almost two and a half decades since Ridley Scott released the sand-and-sandals epic, Gladiator, which took home five Oscars including Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe. In anticipation of the trailer, Paramount debuted the first teaser poster.\n\nWhile Maximus' story ended in Gladiator, it's now his Commodus' nephew Lucius (this time around played by Paul Mescal) to take to the arena against the Roman general Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal). Years later, we find the former emperor-to-be Lucius living in Africa outside the Roman Empire, When Acacius comes to conquer it, he captures Lucius and brings him back to Rome to fight in the arena. Lucius' mother Lucilla (the returning Connie Nielsen) is now in love with the Roman general and doesn't recognize her son after years away.\n\nThe only footage that has been seen of the film was released during CinemaCon earlier this year showed Mescal fighting a rhino and baboons, Roman political intrigue, and emperors described as being \"even more diabolical than Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus\" in the first movie.\n\nThe photos revealed Monday had Mescal looking shredded and in fighting form, so it's almost assuredly going to include some one-on-one sword fighting and taking on animals, similarly to what the original Gladiator trailer showed with the soldiers taking on a tiger.\n\nA sequel to the original blockbuster has been in development in one form or another since a year after the film's initial success. One script that floated around was set fifteen years later, centered on a young adult Lucius searching for the truth about his biological father. However things evolved from there to include Maximus' resurrection and his journey through the afterlife.\n\nEven stranger was when musician Nick Cave was commissioned to write a new draft which involved to \"deities vs. deity vs. humanity\" story. The outlandish premise involved Maximus in purgatory, who is resurrected as an immortal eternal warrior and sent to Earth to kill Jesus Christ. However Maximus is tricked into murdering his own son and cursed to keep fighting for all time. The treatment even included the gladiator fighting in the Crusades, WWII, and the Vietnam War.\n\nRidley Scott was nominated for Best Director for the first film but lost out to Steven Soderberg for Traffic.

The story follows Lucius (Mescal), the former heir of the Roman Empire, who becomes a gladiator after his home is invaded by the Roman army, led by general Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal) during the reign of coemperors Caracalla (Fred Hechinger) and Geta (Joseph Quinn). Washington, meanwhile, portrays Macrinus, a very wealthy arms dealer who uses gladiators for sport.\n\nIt's clear that the movie will feature many a montage of Washington training Mescal as his muse to take on Pascal in the Colosseum. While the final battle is only teased, it seems things will get bloody as the protagonists go head to head. There is also a callback to the original Gladiator when Connie Nielsen as Lucilla gives Mescal the late Maximus' ring.\n\nGladiator II was discussed as early as 2001, but development was halted when DreamWorks sold the rights and property to Paramount in 2006. The official rollout for the sequel began in 2018 and Mescal was cast as the lead role in January 2023. The movie comes after the 2000 film, which starred Russell Crowe, earned five Oscars and 11 nominations including Best Picture and Best Actor.\n\nWhile the role remains his only Oscar, Crowe, 60, has made it clear he won't be returning as Maximus. Those who know the film shouldn't be surprised, as -- spoiler alert -- his character baited opponent Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) into the Colosseum during the movie's final act, killing him before dying of wounds he sustained in the battle.\n\n\"They should be fucking paying me for the amount of questions I am asked about a film I am not even in,\" Crowe joked at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival earlier this year. \"It has nothing to do with me. In that world, I am dead. Six feet under. But I do admit to a certain tinge of jealousy, because it reminds me of when I was younger and what it meant for me, in my life.\"\n\nDespite not being able to step back into the world of the Roman Empire, Crowe noted that the film was more than deserving of a follow up feature. \"I don't know anything about the cast, I don't know anything about the plot. I am dead! But I know that if Ridley has decided to do a second part of the story, over 20 years later, he must have had very strong reasons,\" Crowe continued. \"I can't think of this movie being anything other than spectacular.\"\n\nAs for passing the mantle on to Mescal, Scott told Vanity Fair last month that he became interested in the actor while watching his 2020 Hulu limited series, Normal People.\n\n\"When I watch anything, I tend to be clocking who's interesting,\" he told the outlet at the time. \"It's just in my DNA. And so, watching a TV show that's not really my kind of TV show almost four years ago, I said, 'Who's this guy?'\"\n\nWhen Gladiator II became more of a tangent possibility, Scott said the duo met up on Zoom -- and the rest is history. \"I met with him and he said, 'Of course, I'd love to do it.' And that was it,\" he recalled. \"We were away and running with the ball. He was a special find. He was absolutely perfect.\"\n\nMescal, for his part, confirmed that he and Scott only spoke \"for about 20 to 30 minutes\" before the plan was set in motion.\n\n\"I wanted to get a flavor from him about what the story was going to be about, so we spent about 15 minutes talking about that, and then we spent another 10 minutes talking about the sport that I played growing up -- Gaelic football,\"

The only problem is that the trailer may give a little too much detail as it appears to be edited in timeline order, perhaps spoiling how the story will play out. Not only that, but the fact that the sheer length of 3 minutes these days can come across as an eternity on social media, some are worried that, in an attempt to prove its worthiness, the film went over the top with this morning's trailer.\n\nRegardless, the trailer itself looks AWESOME and although sequels rarely live up to the hype of the original, from this preview alone, I don't think Paramount Pictures will have any difficulty generating enough buzz to recoup their $250-$300 million budget. God knows the box office needs it, with not one film grossing $100 million in tis opening weekend leading into Memorial Day.\n\nLet's delve into the film itself.\n\nFans will immediately notice that the storyline continues just 20 years after the first one ended.\n\nThe official synopsis of the Gladiator sequel reads:\n\n\"From legendary director Ridley Scott, 'Gladiator II' continues the epic saga of power, intrigue, and vengeance set in Ancient Rome. Years after witnessing the death of the revered hero Maximus at the hands of his uncle, Lucius (Mescal) is forced to enter the Colosseum after his home is conquered by the tyrannical Emperors who now lead Rome with an iron fist. With rage in his heart and the future of the Empire at stake, Lucius must look to his past to find strength and honor to return the glory of Rome to its people.\"\n\nSome old familiar faces return to the screen - Connie Wilson will once again play Roman Emperor Commodus (played byr Joaquin Phoenix in the original) and sister Lucilla. Her son Lucius - who we last saw running around the Coliseum as a young boy emulating his uncle Commodus, while also taking a particular liking to 'The Spaniard,' Maximus Decimus Meridius who was played by Russel Crowe, will be the central focus of Gladiator 2.\n\nIrish actor Paul Mescal will take up the incredibly difficult task of trying to live up to the performance that Russel Crowe put forth in the original film - a role that landed him the Oscar for Best Lead Actor.\n\nMescal's task may be as difficult as a slave trying to fight his way through a gauntlet of gladiators in ancient Roman times, but at least he will have some help from some iconic actors like Denzel Washington as well as supporting cast members like Stranger Things' Joseph Quinn and Pedro Pascal,\n\nYou can be sure that the CGI is going to go WILD in this movie and be downright incredible. At one point in the trailer they add water to one of the arenas, and it looks absolutely crazy, not to mention what I suspect will be some pretty bloody fight scenes.\n\n\"I can't tell you how stressed I am talking about that film in particular, because it's definitely the biggest one I've done,\" Mescal told Esquire in an interview about the upcoming film. \"I feel really excited, but, like, it's difficult to get away from the legacy of the film a bit. I think it's really well written, and it pays homage to the first one, but it's very much something that I think I can step into and make comfortably my own.\"\n\nFans will be able to decide for themselves when the movie hits theaters November 22nd - right before the Thanksgiving holiday week.\n\nOnly instead of one Roman Emperor giving the thumbs up or thumbs down on the film's fate, millions of moviegoers will.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_gunzelman@outkick.com", "name": "Mike Gunzelman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colosseum"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnus Maximus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Rome"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epic poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaniards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spaniards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roman emperor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esquire (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/07/GLADIATOR-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-22", "textStart": 3608, "textEnd": 3621}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

That atmosphere is about to change, for better or worse, as the first trailer for Paramount and director Ridley Scott's legacy-quel has now shown us Paul Mescal in action. Headline tie-in reaction.\n\nFreshly unleashing hell on the world, the first public look at Gladiator II's majesty, and to be clear, we're lightyears away from Nick Cave's wild reincarnation concept. Lay out those initial plot blocks here.\n\nPreviously, returning co-star Connie Nielsen teased Gladiator II as a \"magnificent spectacle,\" and no that's not only being directed towards Paul Mescal and his totally buff physique. Trailer spectacle reaction.\n\nSpeaking of Paul Mescal's efforts getting ripped, that work has clearly paid off. Even in the first photos from Gladiator II made that abundantly clear, with the all grown up Lucius feeling the sand like his late mentor Maximus would. I mean, that's a shot that's so iconic, you could put it on a teaser poster. And if you look below, you'll see Paramount Pictures knew the assignment, and killed it:\n\nGladiator II prepares to usher in another era of strength and honor, starting November 22nd.

Sure, it won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and sure, director Ridley Scott is still going strong more than two decades later. But the story of Maximus had a definitive arc and ending. As portrayed by Russell Crowe, the general-turned-gladiator Maximus died after leading a revolt against Rome and the corrupt Emperor Commodus (a wild Joaquin Phoenix).\n\nSo what is the point of a sequel 20 years later? Yes, the empire limps on for a few more centuries, but that's not enough to justify a direct sequel to a standalone story from the previous film.\n\nFortunately, the trailer for Gladiator II clarifies the connection between the first film and the sequel. The trailer opens with narration from Lucius (Paul Mescal), the nephew of Commodus in the original movie and former heir of the Empire before the death of his father. Lucius recalls watching Maximus' revolt as a child (played back then by Spencer Treat Clark of Unbreakable fame), as depicted at the climax of Gladiator. Now as an adult, Lucius sees Maximus as an inspiration for his own resistance to the Empire after he is also imprisoned and forced to become a gladiator.\n\nThe trailer solidifies the connection with a scene featuring Lucius speaking with his mother Lucilla (once again played by Connie Nielsen), who became Maximus' lover in the first film.

It also has arguably better source material. The original, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Russell Crowe, written by David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson, was released in 2000, going on to win five Oscars (out of 12 nominations) and was the second-highest grossing film of that year (behind Mission Impossible 2).\n\nNow the ageless Ridley Scott (okay fine, he's 86) returns to direct Gladiator II, from a script by David Scarpa (Napoleon, All The Money In The World), with Paul Mescal in the lead. God, how refreshing is it to just have a number after the title?\n\nSet to be released November 15th in the U.K. and a week later in the US, the first trailer just hit, clocking in at a supersized 3:09.\n\nReportedly budgeted at $250-$310 million, Gladiator II stars Mescal as Lucius, whom we learn in a flashback is actually the grown-up version of a character we met in the original -- the precocious nephew (played by Spencer Treat Clark, who was 12 at the time and currently still working) of Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus, who also idolizes Russell Crowe's Maximus. A former heir to the crown, Lucius has since been kidnapped and sold into slavery and is now fighting for his life and freedom in the gladiatorial pits. Life comes at you fast in ancient Rome.\n\nThe sequel certainly doesn't lack for star power. In the role of the mentor, first played by Oliver Reed (who died in Malta while filming the first one, allegedly after challenging a crew of British sailors to a drinking contest, according to David Franzoni, who says he still has the bar tab), we now have Denzel Washington, who's actually eight years older than Reed was, though you'd never guess it. Washington looks great in guyliner and leopard fur, and the trailer seems to tease an expanded role for his character, compared to Reed's Proximo in the original.\n\nPedro Pascal plays Marcus Acacius, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Maximus who seems to be neither full villain nor hero, based on the trailer. Connie Nielsen reprises her role as Lucius's mother, though she has apparently been estranged from him for all the intervening years. And of course it wouldn't be Gladiator without shitty little nepo-boy rulers, in this case Geta and Caracella (based on real guys, brothers who co-ruled Rome from 209-211), played by Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger, who was so brilliant as the weird brother in the first season of White Lotus.", "source": {"uri": "gq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "British GQ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@gq.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetlejuice_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beetlejuice (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nicholson_(writer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Nicholson (writer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Franzoni", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Franzoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Logan_(writer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Logan (writer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Rome"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly Hills, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Scarpa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Scarpa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Treat_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Treat Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Napoleon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Grohl", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dave Grohl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hechinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Hechinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_If...?_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "What If...?

movie begins in Numidia, with viewers seeing Lucius enjoying a relatively easy life with his wife and child.\n\nBut he's forced to take action following the Romans' ruthless and continued descent into

The film received 12 Oscar nominations, eventually winning in five categories, including Best Picture.\n\nThe cast of the film have been spotted doing re-shoots at Devil's Dyke, a V-shaped valley in Sussex, England, with Mescal seen in costume, bloodied and bruised, filming a dramatic fight scene. While primary cinematography had originally taken place in Morocco, reshoots had to happen in the English National Trust park.\n\nRidley Scott's sequel starring Mescal is highly anticipated, since audiences have waited 24 years for a follow-up. Plus, Mescal is joined by a starry cast that includes The Last of Us star Pedro Pascal, Denzel Washington and Stranger Things actor Joseph Quinn. Find out everything you need to know about it, below.\n\nThe sequel will see Mescal take on the lead role of Lucius, the son of Connie Nielsen's Lucilla and nephew of Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nNielsen will be returning alongside another legacy cast member, Derek Jacobi, who is returning to play Gracchus.\n\nFred Hechinger, best known for The White Lotus, and Quinn play co-emperors Geta and Caracalla, respectively, while Washington plays a former slave seeking revenge.\n\nOther names include Pascal starring as powerful Roman general Marcus Acacius, who trained under Crowe's Maximus Decimus Meridius. Little Britain star Matt Lucas and Avatar's Peter Mensah will also feature.\n\nMescal didn't have to audition for the sequel, as he said he was approached by Scott, who had hand-picked him to play the leading character.\n\nThe Aftersun star explained that he had met with the iconic director and \"discussed the parameters of the story. Then, after the fact, I was given a script\".\n\n\"It's an intimidating feat. It's something I'm nervous about but something I feel like I can do,\" Mescal said. \"And I'm so proud I get to make it.\"\n\nReleased on July 9, the film's first trailer sees Washington's character Macrinus ask Mescal's character, \"Where were you born?\" He responds: \"I don't know, I never knew a mother nor a father.\" Subsequent scenes show the colosseum, flashbacks and the Emperor and his allies strategising.\n\n\"Years after witnessing the death of the revered hero Maximus at the hands of his uncle, Lucius (Mescal) is forced to enter the Colosseum after his home is conquered by the tyrannical Emperors who now lead Rome with an iron,\" the film's promotional material says.\n\n\"With rage in his heart and the future of the Empire at stake, Lucius must look to his past to find strength and honor to return the glory of Rome to its people.\"\n\nWhile timeframes have not been confirmed, Scott previously has teased that Lucius has been living in the woods for 15 years with no connection to his mother (Nielsen), believing her to be dead. The film could pick up almost two decades from where the original film finished.\n\nPlot details remain under wraps, but a preview of an unfinished trailer premiered at CinemaCon in April 2024, showing a bloodied Mescal fighting multiple gladiators, as well as baboons and rhinos.\n\nThe original film was set in 180 AD, following Maximus returning home after leading Roman forces to victory.\n\nGladiator 2 will arrive in cinemas on 15 November 2024.\n\nCrowe, who won an Academy Award for the film, has debunked the claim he will appear in a flashback scene in the film, and admitted to feeling \"jealous\" about Mescal's experience, stating: \"I was a much younger man, obviously, and it was a huge experience in my life. It's something that changed my life, really. It changed the way people regarded me and what I do for a living.\"\n\nAlthough Crowe has strongly denied rumours that he will appear in a flashback scene for Gladiator 2, the actor threw speculation into overdrive when he was spotted in Malta in July, where the film is being shot.\n\nThe Cinderella Man star claimed that he was \"in Malta recently\" for another reason entirely, to perform a concert with his band Indoor Garden Party.\n\nHe did, however, tell outlets that seeing the film's set - which he said is identical to the one built in the 1990s - made him nostalgic.\n\nIn another interview with Kyle Meredith, Crowe explained why he is \"slightly uncomfortable with the fact they're making another one\".\n\n\"Because, of course, I'm dead and I have no say in what gets done,\" he said, going on to explain that he is not a fan of what he has heard of the new film's plot.\n\n\"A couple of the things I've heard I'm like, 'No, no, no, that's not in the moral journey of that particular character,'\" he said.\n\n\"But I can't say anything, it's not my place, I'm six feet under. So we'll see what that is like.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type":

In a seven-year span, the actor starred in L.A. Confidential, The Insider, Gladiator, A Beautiful Mind (maybe not his finest film, but a Best Picture-winning hit nonetheless), and Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. He was nominated for Best Actor three years in a row! The South Park parody was the icing on the Australian cake (so, Lamingtons?). But while the world waits for more adventures on the oceans, which are now battlefields, another of Crowe's films from this era is getting a sequel, albeit without his involvement.\n\nParamount Pictures has released the first trailer for Gladiator II, which sounds pretty great. Directed by Ridley Scott, the sequel stars Paul Mescal as Luicus, the son of Lucilla, played by returning cast member Connie Nielsen. He's \"forced to enter the Colosseum after his home is conquered by the tyrannical Emperors who now lead Rome with an iron fist. With rage in his heart and the future of the Empire at stake, Lucius must look to his past to find strength and honor to return the glory of Rome to its people,\" according to the synopsis.\n\nThe cast also includes Pedro Pascal as Roman general Marcus Acacius and Denzel Washington as \"pretty fucking cruel\" powerbroker Macrinus. You will be entertained.\n\nWhen asked by Vanity Fair what Gladiator II is really about, Mescal replied, \"What human beings will do to survive, but also what human beings will do to win. We see that in the arena, but also in the political struggle that's going on outside of my character's storyline, where you see there's other characters striving and pulling for power. Where's the space for humanity? Where's the space for love, familial connection? And ultimately, will those things overcome this kind of greed and power? Those things are oftentimes directly in conflict with each other.\"\n\nGladiator II, which also stars Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger, Lior Raz, and Derek Jacobi, opens in theaters on November 22.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Insider_(TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Insider (TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Confidential", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "L.A.

Ridley Scott's long-awaited follow-up to 2000's Gladiator stars Paul Mescal as Lucius, the nephew of Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus.\n\nWe get our first proper glimpse of the Aftersun star in action in the new trailer, released today, which gives an idea of the plot of Scott's latest epic. Soundtracked to Jay-Z and Kanye West's 'No Church In The Wild', it features ambitious sequences, brutal new villains, and fights with rhinos and sharks. Yes, really.\n\nAlongside Mescal, the movie brings back Connie Nielsen as Lucilla and Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus. Pedro Pascal joins the cast as Marcus Acacius and Denzel Washington as Macrinus, alongside Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger, and May Calamawy. Check out our full trailer breakdown below.\n\nThe trailer begins with Mescal's Lucius speaking to Washington's Macrinus as clips from the first Gladiator play on the screen. \"I remember that day,\" Lucius says, \"I never forgot it. When a slave could take revenge against an emperor.\" We see Russell Crowe's Maximus in the Colosseum, as a young Lucius looks on. The sequel picks up decades after the original film, and Lucius has no memory of his family or who raised him, aside from that memory. Macrinus sees something in him, and vows to make him his \"instrument\".\n\nThere are some seriously epic fight scenes in the first Gladiator 2 trailer as Lucius is plucked by Macrinus to enter the arena. Hands down the most wild is the shark sequence. The Colosseum is filled up with water as the gladiators enter on a boat with sharks swimming underneath them. At one point, a fighter falls in the water to bloody consequences. It's a moment that needs to move past logistics (just, how did they get the sharks in there?) to just appreciate its sheer drama. That's not all either, there's also a rhino fight tucked into the first look, which given there are also reports that baboons will make an appearance, means there's a zoo load of action to come.\n\nWhile not all of the plot has been revealed yet for Gladiator 2, the trailer gives us our best idea yet. After Lucius' home is invaded by the Roman Empire, and its military general, Marcus Acacius, he finds himself taken as a prisoner. It's here that Macrinus finds him and takes him under his wing. \"You have something in you. Rage. Rage is your gift,\" Macrinus says to him as Lucius vows to take down all of Rome, but admits he will settle for a General.\n\nThe General in question is Pascal's Marcus Acacius, who we first meet as the new emperors Geta and Caracalla, are enamored with him. From the early details released from Vanity Fair, we know there's history there between Lucius and Marcus Acacius, and it seems they're setting them up for a brutal fight. We see the brute rage at the end of the trailer as the pair face off. \"This is how Rome treats its heroes,\" screams Lucius, echoing the vehemence of Maximus' 'are you not entertained' speech.\n\nGladiator 2 releases in UK cinemas on November 15, before heading to US theaters on November 22.

The director has long wanted to make a sequel, and we're finally getting Gladiator II later this year. Paramount Pictures just dropped the first trailer, and it promises to be just as much of a visual feast, as a new crop of power players (plus a couple of familiar faces) clash over the future of Rome.\n\n(Spoilers for 2000's Gladiator below.)\n\nFor those who inexplicably haven't seen the original: Russell Crowe starred as Maximus, a Roman general who leads his army to victory against Germanic tribes on behalf of his emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). The aging emperor wishes Maximus to succeed him and restore the Roman Republic, passing over his own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Commodus secretly murders his father instead and proclaims himself emperor, executing Maximus' wife and son because the latter would not acknowledge his rule. Commodus also harbors squicky incestuous longings for his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), mother to Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).\n\nMaximus ends up being sold by slave traders to gladiator trainer Proximus (Oliver Reed), who tells him he can earn his freedom by \"winning the crowd\" during the gladiator games in Rome. And win the crowd he does. Who could forget the epic scene where the gladiators are forced to re-enact the Battle of Zama, when the Romans defeated the Carthaginians? With Maximus in command, the tables are turned and the \"Carthaginians\" prevail in the re-enactment. Maximus is ultimately able to exact his revenge by killing Commodus in the arena, dying himself to join his wife and child in the afterlife.\n\nGladiator received much critical praise, grossing $464 million globally and receiving 12 Oscar nominations. It won five: Best Picture, Best Actor (Crowe), Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Costume Design. Scott was already planning for either a prequel or a sequel the following year, with the idea for a sequel centered on an older version of Lucius, hinging on the secret of his biological father (strongly hinted to be Maximus in the first film). But when Dreamworks was sold to Paramount in 2006, the Gladiator sequel project was shelved. Paramount finally green-lit the project in November 2018 with a production budget of $165 million. (That ballooned to a rumored $310 million during filming.)\n\nStrength and honor\n\nGladiator II does indeed center on Lucius Verus (Paul Mescal), son of Lucilla and former heir to the Roman Empire, given that his father (also named Lucius Verus) was once a co-emperor of Rome. Lucius hasn't been seen in Rome for 15 years. Instead, he's been living in a small coastal town in Numidia with his wife and child. Like Maximus before him, he is captured by the Roman army and forced to become a gladiator. Pedro Pascal plays Marcus Acacius, a Roman general who trained under Maximus, tasked with conquering North Africa. Although the young Lucius once idolized Maximus, Marcus Acacius apparently will be a symbol of everything Lucius hates.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars

The director's new story in the same universe stars Mescal as Lucius Verus, the nephew of former Emperor Commodus, the patricidal traitor-turned-emperor played by Joaquin Phoenix in the first film. Lucius' mother, Lucilla (Nielsen), sent him away to grow up in Numidia, a region in the northern coast of Africa, where he starts his own family and resents his mother and the empire.\n\nWhen the Roman army (led by Pascal's general Marcus Acacius) attacks, Lucius' new home is destroyed and he's captured and brought back to Rome to be a gladiator. The Rome he returns to is corrupt and cruel, led by two \"sadistic\" co-Emperors (Hechinger and Quinn), and Lucius finds his mother is involved with the very general who just destroyed his way of life in Numidia.\n\nET spoke with the film's leading man about the new entry in the film's iconic franchise, during which Mescal revealed what he's most excited for fans to experience.\n\n\"I think the main thing that I'm excited about is the homage that it pays to the first one, but also the kind of new direction that the film takes,\" he shares with ET. \"I think it's well balanced in that regard in terms of the physical action of the film and the balance of the kind of political aspects of the film as well.\"\n\nWhile the film has plenty of action and battle scenes, it's fiercest competition will be the highly anticipated film adaptation of the Broadway sensation Wicked, which will also arrive in theaters on Nov. 22, five days ahead of its initial Thanksgiving weekend release date of Nov. 27.\n\nHelmed by Jon M. Chu, Wicked stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo as its two main witches, Glinda the Good Witch and Elphaba the Wicked Witch of the West. The film follows how the duo went from foes to unlikely friends while together on the campus of Shiz University. The adaptation also stars Bridgerton's Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero -- the love interest who finds himself caught between Elphaba and Glinda -- Oscar winner Michelle Yeoh as headmistress Madame Morrible and Jeff Goldblum as the Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\n\n\"Wickdiator doesn't really roll off the tongue does it? I think my preference would probably be Glicked if it has a similar effect to what it did for Barbie and Oppenheimer,\" Mescal tells ET. \"It would be amazing 'cause I think the films couldn't be more polar opposites and it worked in that context previously. So fingers crossed people come out and see both films on opening weekend.\"\n\nIn an interview with Vanity Fair published on July 1, Scott shared that he was drawn to Mescal for the role of Lucius after seeing him on Hulu's limited series, Normal People.\n\n\"When I watch anything, I tend to be clocking who's interesting. It's just in my DNA. And so, watching a TV show that's not really my kind of TV show almost four years ago, I said, 'Who's this guy?'\" Scott said of Mescal drawing his attention in the adaptation of Sally Rooney's 2018 best-selling book.\n\nScott recalled arranging a Zoom with Mescal while the latter was performing A Streetcar Named Desire in London: \"I met with him and he said, 'Of course, I'd love to do it.' And that was it. We were away and running with the ball. He was a special find. He was absolutely perfect.\"\n\nMescal added that the conversation took \"about 20 to 30 minutes.\"\n\n\"I wanted to get a flavor from him about what the story was going to be about, so we spent about 15 minutes talking about that, and then we spent another 10 minutes talking about the sport that I played growing up -- Gaelic football. Maybe that was something that helped with it, in that I'm used to being physical in my body,\" he shared, adding that Scott later decided he didn't need to do a camera test. \"My memory of it is that probably two or three weeks later, the offer came in.\"\n\nMescal calls his casting \"an immense honor,\" telling ET that the enormity of the role isn't lost on him considering the film is \"hugely important to a lot of people across the world.\"\n\n\"And for the great Ridley Scott to pass the baton on to me is something that my drama school self, or even the version of myself that was 15 watching the film for the first time, could never have imagined,\" he adds, laughing.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated actor stars alongside Washington, who plays a former slave-turned-wealthy arms dealer named Macrinus, Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus, Tim McInnerny as Thraex, and Alexander Karim as Ravi, alongside Lior Raz, Peter Mensah, Matt Lucas, May Calamawy and more.\n\n\"I am in scenes with the great Denzel Washington and have made great friends with Pedro and Joe and Connie and Fred,\" Mescal marvels when talking about his co-stars. \"I think for a lot of us, especially the younger cohort of the cast, we would easily say that it's a job that changed our lives in the filming process and at the precipice of it coming out into the world. We're kind of waiting with bated breath, but the thing that I keep coming back to is, we've done it. We've gone and made it and nobody can take that away from us. And we had the king that is Ridley Scott at the helm -- like, it's amazing.\"\n\nIt's especially a dream come true for Mescal, who confesses that he's been a fan of the original film since he was a teen.\n\n\"I probably saw it 10 years after the release cause I would've been only 4 or 5 when the film came out, and I remember watching it with my Dad and being absolutely blown away by it,\" Mescal recalls, adding that Gladiator is a film \"a lot of men my age\" learn to \"quote religiously.\"\n\nNoting that the film has been a popular figure in cultural zeitgeist for over 20 years, Mescal adds: \"There [are] not a lot of films that have done that, especially in this genre, so there's a healthy amount of pressure. But [there's] also a healthy amount of confidence from the people that made the film. We are excited to add the next installment to a film that has been and will continue to be incredibly popular.\"", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Verus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lucius Verus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_M._Chu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jon M.

The dual emperors of Rome are thirsty for blood. Step back into the coliseum, ladies and gentlemen, it's time for glorious combat.\n\nAfter a bunch of teaser images and previews have been released over the past few weeks, the first trailer for Gladiator II is out this morning and it's absolutely stunning. I have not been this hyped for a movie about Rome since the first trailer for the original Gladiator dropped nearly 25 years ago. (I've actually purchased that film in 4K Blu-ray format to watch again for the first time in years before the sequel comes out).\n\nThe sequel to Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix's epic historical drama picks up years after the first movie, and follows Lucius (Paul Mescal) the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and nephew to the first film's villain, Commodus (Phoenix).\n\nLucius was a boy in that film, played by Spencer Treat Clark. His mother shipped him off to Africa and out of Rome's clutches, but he has returned in the sequel as a gladiator where he meets the powerful and scheming Macrinus (Denzel Washington) and General Marcus Acacius, who once served under General Maximus (Crowe).\n\nHere's the trailer:\n\nThis looks every bit as epic and grand as the first film, with an even more star-studded cast. Mescal, a young Irish actor, is the least well-known among the leads but director Ridley Scott became a fan of his after watching Normal People. Apparently the two only spoke for half an hour before Scott decided to cast him. Mescal also starred in Aftersun, which received rave reviews and just recently landed on Netflix.\n\nAccording to an interview with Vanity Fair, Pascal found the battles in the movie a challenge to film. \"It's brutal, man. I call him Brick Wall Paul,\" he said of his co-star. \"He got so strong. I would rather be thrown from a building than have to fight him again. To go up against somebody that fit and that talented and that much younger.... Outside of Ridley being a total genius, Paul is a big reason as to why I would put my poor body through that experience.\"\n\nMescal said he didn't want to train to look like an underwear model, focusing on fight choreography instead: \"I just wanted to be big and strong and look like somebody who can cause a bit of damage,\" he told Vanity Fair.\n\nNielsen, who reprises her role as Lucilla, said of Pascal, \"What a gift that guy is. Even to play with, to work with, I just absolutely love him, and he's so perfect for this role. He is one of those rare actors who really has heart, soul, and at the same time this incredible gift of transformation.\"\n\nRounding out the cast are Fred Hechinger (Thelma) as Emperor Caracalla and Joseph Quinn (Stranger Things) as Emperor Geta. The two come off as rather unhinged in the trailer.\n\nFor his part, Scott says this sequel means a great deal to him especially after giving up the chance to direct so many of his other classics. \"I mean, I should have done the sequels to Alien and to Blade Runner. You change over the years. At that time, I didn't want to go through it again.\" James Cameron ended up directing the sequel to Alien and Dune director, Denis Villeneuve, directed Blade Runner 2049. Back in the 80s, as a newcomer, \"I was never told or asked. You can imagine I wasn't happy.\"\n\nOriginal composer Hans Zimmer returns for the sequel as well.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Continue to check back with us as we will be adding more information as it becomes available.\n\nSummary\n\nGladiator 2 features two emperors, Caracalla and Geta, reflecting real Roman history. The 2024 sequel is set in a reimagined Roman history, like the original movie. Despite inaccuracies, some aspects of Gladiator 2 are based on real events.\n\nGladiator 2 is set to delve back into a reimagined version of Roman history - much like the original movie - yet unlike Ridley Scott's celebrated 2000 Best Picture-winner, the 2024 sequel is set to feature two emperors, rather than one. While this might seem strange, there is a good reason for this.\n\nTwo decades, after his hugely successful sword-and-sandal epic, Gladiator 2 sees Ridley Scott return to Ancient Rome, once again playing fast and loose with history. However, while several details are inaccurate, some aspects - including the role of the movie's two emperors, is based in reality.\n\nEven though it might seem like an overly complicated narrative device, the real reason Gladiator 2 has two emperors is because it's a reflection of what happened in real Roman history. Both Caracalla and Geta ruled Rome after original Gladiator antagonist Commodus in the early 200s. As such, Gladiator 2 is surprisingly historically accurate.\n\nGladiator II\n\nNot Yet Rated\n\nDirector Ridley Scott\n\nRelease Date November 22, 2024\n\nCast Paul Mescal , Denzel Washington , Connie Nielsen , Derek Jacobi , Joseph Quinn , Fred Hechinger , Pedro Pascal", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tommy_lethbridge@screenrant.com", "name": "Tommy Lethbridge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Rome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "History of Rome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracalla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caracalla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geta_(emperor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geta (emperor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roman emperor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peplum_(film_genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peplum (film genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epic poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hechinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Hechinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Jacobi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derek Jacobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Rome"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Databases", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Education", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/joseph-quinn-looking-displeased-in-gladiator-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

It's gotten fancier since 2000's Gladiator -- now there's a whole ship battle on its flooded floor. Twenty-four years after the Oscar-winning, Russell Crowe-starring Gladiator, director Ridley Scott has returned to the Colosseum for Gladiator II, which tells the story of Lucius, who was just a boy (played by Spencer Treat Clark) in the original film.\n\nThe trailer is very aware that we might not remember the details of young Lucius' life, so it starts there, with faded flashbacks: The boy is the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and was the nephew of Joaquin Phoenix's Emperor Commodus. But he didn't grow up on Rome's clearly dramatic streets, as the synopsis explains:\n\nLucius, Variety explains, was sent to \"the northern African region of Numidia, where he was sent by his mother as a child as it was just outside the reach of the Roman Empire.\" But now he's back, and he's very angry (understandably) about injustice. He becomes the instrument of Denzel Washington's Macrinus, who has his own very strong (understandable) feelings about the Roman Empire.\n\nThis trailer is full of cliches -- the woman who dies so the hero can be (further) motivated; the handing over of a meaningful ring; the villains coded as effeminate -- that make it seem as if this movie were actually made at least 24 years ago, hot on the heels of the original. And while Scott certainly knows how to stage an epic battle, the movie's set pieces have been (probably wisely) held back so that we only get a taste of the fights.\n\nPedro Pascal plays General Marcus Acacius; Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger play Rome's twin emperors, who seem no better than Commodus (one gleefully shouts \"They can eat war!\" when Marcus Acacius points out that Rome has hungry people). Moon Knight's May Calamawy is here (possibly as the archer Lucius is mourning?) and so, somehow, is Matt Lucas. Game of Thrones' Rory McCann -- the Hound -- being in this cast makes a perfect sort of sense.\n\nGladiator II is based on characters created by David Franzoni, who wrote the story for the original film. The story for this one is by Peter Craig (co-writer of The Batman) and David Scarpa; Scarpa (who also wrote Ridley Scott's Napoleon) wrote the screenplay.

He is also Lucilla's new love interest.\n\nThe White Lotus' Fred Hechinger and Stranger Things' Joseph Quinn also appear in the film as brother Emperors Geta and Caracalla, and are described by the director as 'damaged goods from birth'.\n\nWe're sure the film's upcoming release this November will be a relief for star Paul Mescal as he admitted that he was getting 'stressed' when asked about it as he can't say much as a reply.\n\nHis chat with Esquire UK discussed many aspects of his life, from his Oscar nomination to dealing with fan attention and his role in the upcoming Ridley Scott sequel naturally came up in conversation.\n\nHe explained: 'I can't tell you how stressed I am talking about that film in particular because it's definitely the biggest one I've done. I feel really excited, but, like, it's difficult to get away from the legacy of the film a bit.

That is until The Last of Us star Pascal - playing Roman general Marcus Acacius - storms the city, taking him as a slave and forcing him to become a gladiator.\n\nAs he prepares to battle Marcus - presumably to the death - he's also confronting the rule of emperors Geta (Stranger Things' Joseph Quinn) and Caracalla (Fred Hechinger, of The White Lotus fame).\n\nTo make matters worse. arriving in the arena for his first battle, he sees his mother - a shock, considering he has been none-the-wiser about whether she was alive or not. Oh, and she's in love with Marcus.\n\nIn the latest look at Ridley Scott's drama, Mescal's Lucius is left battered and brutalised by his captivity, with the film promising some of the year's very best sword-fight scenes. At the end of the clip, Mescal goes for the jugular, threatening to decapitate one of his arena rivals.\n\nOh, and it's not just sword-based violence here, either: one scene sees Lucius charged at by a rhino, in what is one of the trailer's most captivating moments.\n\nWhile Pascal has described his character as \"a very good general, which can mean a very good killer,\" it's Lucius who has an unsatiated fury to fight everyone in his way.\n\n\"It's very 'angry young man' drama in that sense,\" Mescal recently said of his character.\n\n\"He can see the way Rome has kind of fallen in on itself... Rome represents all the personal neglect that he felt as a child. Suddenly, he's thrust back into that world and has direct proximity to all of the things he thinks he hates and doesn't feel attached to any more.\"\n\nThe list of people who are a thorn in Lucius's side includes Denzel Washington's character Macrinus, a wealthy power broker who keeps a stable full of gladiators. According to Scott, he's \"pretty f**king cruel\" to those fighting in the arena.\n\nThe film also features gay British veteran of stage and screen Derek Jacobi reprising his role as Gracchus, a member of the Roman senate.\n\nThe trailer alone is a pretty wild ride, promising to live up to the heart-pounding brutality seen in the first film. By the looks of it, a naff sequel for sequel's sake is absolutely not what Alien and Thelma & Louise director Scott has planned.", "source": {"uri": "thepinknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

I never forgot it. That a slave could take revenge against an emperor.\"\n\nThe fast-moving three-minute video is set against the hip-hop track No Church In The Wild by Kanye West, showing us bloody and violent Rome where life is cheap.\n\nClearly a top choice for the role of the former heir to the empire, Mescal has said Scott offered him the role after an informal meeting of around half an hour.\n\nThe story begins with Lucius living with his wife and child in Numidia, North Africa, where his mother Lucilla sent him following the action of the first film.\n\nHe's then bought to Rome as a prisoner and put to fight in the arena.\n\nOther cast include The Last Of Us star Pascal plays Roman general Marcus Acacius, a fighter who trained under the watch of Maximus, and Denzel Washington, as rich tradesman Macrinus, who has made his fortune selling supplies to the armies of Europe.\n\nTwin brothers, played by Fred Hechinger and Joseph Quinn, are the capricious emperors leading a brutal and corrupt Rome.\n\nThe movie also features Connie Nielsen and Sir Derek Jacobi, reprising their original roles nearly a quarter of a decade on.\n\nCrowe, who won an Oscar for his performance in the 2000 film, does not return for the sequel.\n\nWhen asked how he felt about the new movie, Crowe told Sky News in June: \"I feel old. That's how I feel about it,\" he says. \"That period of my life, you know, was a huge change. Everything just went kind of crazy for a while.\n\n\"I do have extremely fond memories of it. And, to be completely honest, there's a tinge of jealousy because I certainly wish I was back at being, you know, 35, 36, in a certain way, so I could have that kind of experience again.\"", "source":

There's also an all-star cast ensemble on board, which so far includes:\n\nDetails about the plot are thin on the ground but we do know roughly what we can expect from the sequel, which we'll briefly cover below. In the meantime, if you're after something similar to watch, Prime Video and Peacock are releasing a new historical epic called Those About to Die that looks like Gladiator crossed with Game of Thrones on July 19.\n\nAfter more than two decades, we're finally heading back to ancient Rome's Colosseum to continue the epic saga. Will there be a newly formed republic, like Marcus Aurelius had wished? Let's not get our hopes up.\n\nFrom what has been said so far about the plot, Gladiator II's story is set to pick up a few years after the original movie left off, and will focus on former heir to the Roman empire, Lucius (Paul Mescal) who we'll meet as his home is being conquered by \"the tyrannical Emperors who now lead Rome with an iron fist\" - so it looks like we can expect more of history's bloodiest battles to come to the big screen...\n\n\"With rage in his heart and the future of the Empire at stake, Lucius must look to his past to find strength and honor to return the glory of Rome to its people,\" the plot synopsis adds, setting the scene for an action-packed blockbuster that looks to be filled with plenty of spectacle from what we've seen in the trailer, which included a rhino, sharks and more - you can probably see why it's one of 18 movies we're most excited to watch in 2024.\n\nCan't remember what happened to Russell Crowe in the first Gladiator? You can stream the original on Prime Video in the US and UK, as well as on Netflix in the UK and Australia, while you wait for Gladiator II to be released later this year.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amelia_schwanke@techradar.com", "name": "Amelia Schwanke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime_Video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime Video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Aurelius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Rome"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colosseum"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Game of Thrones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cAwBoU3LVY6EUxJWmjANf3-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-22", "textStart": 373, "textEnd": 384}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 1144, "textEnd": 1151}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Upcoming projects like Fantastic Four and non-franchise films like The Wild Robot highlight Pascal's expanding movie career. After working with iconic directors, and earning roles in major franchises, Pedro Pascal is on the path to becoming a legendary film star.\n\nPedro Pascal is set to star in Ridley Scott's Gladiator II, but this epic action movie is only the start of an incredible future for the actor. Though Pascal has been a familiar face since his breakout role in Game of Thrones in 2014, it is only in the last few years that he has become a major film and television star. It began when Pascal played some of his best characters: Din Djarin in The Mandalorian and Joel in the video-game-to-TV adaptation, The Last of Us. Now, it seems that Pascal is only getting more and more incredible roles.\n\nPedro Pascal's rising fame isn't simply a result of his talent. It is his versatility that makes him such a huge star. Over the years, Pascal has proven that he can take on various different roles. Though his most popular characters lean more towards the gruff hero, other Pascal movies and shows have been able to showcase his more comedic side. For example, The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent gave Pascal a chance to play a funnier, stranger type of character. Furthermore, Pascal's real personality is so optimistic and easy-going, it is hard not to enjoy everything he does.\n\nRelated Gladiator 2: Release Date, Cast, Story & Everything We Know\n\nMore than 20 years after the original Gladiator, the sequel is happening. Here is everything we know about Gladiator 2's release, cast, and story.\n\nGladiator 2 Will Be The First Of Many Major Blockbusters Starring Pedro Pascal Pascal Has Several Upcoming Projects Close\n\nSince The Last of Us premiered in January 2023, Pedro Pascal hasn't been on-screen much, but that is about to change very soon. In November 2024, Pascal will appear in Ridley Scott's highly-anticipated sequel, Gladiator II. Based on the recently released images from Gladiator II, it seems that Pascal will not only be back in action, but more importantly, he will be in the gladiator ring. Gladiator II is going to be a massive release no matter what, considering the first movie's success and the scale of the Roman Empire story, but Pascal's involvement is a welcome cherry on top.\n\nThe actor isn't stopping at Gladiator II either. Pascal has a number of big movies coming out in the next year or so. In terms of big IPs, Pascal is slated to appear as Mister Fantastic in 2025's Fantastic Four. Inevitably, this will lead into other significant Marvel movies, potentially including Avengers 5 or even Avengers 6. On top of that, Pascal is taking The Mandalorian to the big screen in 2026 with his upcoming movie, The Mandalorian & Grogu. The actor also has a number of non-franchise movies on the way, including The Wild Robot, Tropico, and Eddington.\n\nPedro Pascal's Upcoming Movies\n\nEstimated Release Year\n\nThe Wild Robot\n\n2024\n\nGladiator II\n\n2024\n\nThe Fantastic Four\n\n2025\n\nThe Mandalorian & Grogu\n\n2026\n\nTropico\n\nTBA\n\nEddington\n\nTBA\n\nMaterialists\n\nTBA\n\nPedro Pascal Has Conquered TV (& He Is Now Going For The Movies) Pascal Will Be A Certified Movie Star\n\nPedro Pascal's upcoming movies are a huge indicator of where his career is headed. Though Pascal has appeared in a number of movies over the years, television is where he truly broke into the entertainment industry. It started with his performance as Oberyn Martell in Game of Thrones and has since snowballed into leading one of the most critically acclaimed sci-fi series of the last few years via The Last of Us. In many ways, Pascal has dominated television. Now, it seems he has his sights set on conquering movies as well.\n\nThe Last of Us is definitely a notable franchise, but it doesn't have the longevity of Marvel or Star Wars.\n\nSince breaking into movies, Pedro Pascal's career has already changed in important ways. Of his various upcoming movies, a great number of them are attached to incredible franchises and properties. The Last of Us is definitely a notable franchise, but it doesn't have the longevity of Marvel or Star Wars. Even Gladiator II is a step in the right direction for Pascal. By working with iconic directors like Ridley Scott, and popular actors like Denzel Washington, Pascal is setting himself up for even more success. At the end of the next few years, Pascal will likely be a legendary film star.\n\nWhat To Expect From Pedro Pascal's Gladiator 2 Role Marcus Acacius Explained\n\nHowever, before Pedro Pascal takes over a number of movie franchises, he must first appear in Gladiator II. In the film, Pascal plays Marcus Acacius. Similar to Russell Crowe's Maximus Decimus Meridius, Marcus Acacius is a former Roman general who is forced to fight as a gladiator after going against his orders. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Ridley Scott described Pascal's character as being \"a man in deep regret with his life and doesn't know where to go with it.\"\n\nOverall, Gladiator II will almost certainly be a major movie event. It seems that Pascal's character has the chance to be either an amazing hero or a terrible villain, but either way, the actor has the capability of delivering an outstanding performance. Furthermore, it will be great to see Pascal put on the gladiator uniform and get into the fighting. At this point, Pedro Pascal and his fans have plenty to look forward to in the coming years.\n\nSource: Vanity Fair\n\nGladiator II Not Yet RatedActionDramaEpicHistoryAdventure\n\nGladiator 2 is the follow-up to Ridley Scott's award-winning film Gladiator from 2000. Scott returns to direct the sequel, with Paul Mescal staring as Lucius, alongside Denzel Washington and Barry Keoghan as the villain Emperor Geta.

None of them are half as exciting as Ridley Scott's Gladiator II, though, a film which lands 24 years after its predecessor and picks up a similar time period later - give or take - to follow the fate of Gladiator's boyish Lucius. Now a brawny man played by Paul Mescal, he'll be following Russell Crowe's Maximus into the arena two decades after his boyhood hero's death at the hands of Commodus.\n\nYes, the 'busy little bee' is now more of a fackin' massive hornet - and he's got time on his hands to kill everyone who has crossed him. Which, judging by the first trailer, is the entire Roman Empire. Here's what to look out for in the trailer.\n\nHe broke our hearts with Normal People and Aftersun and broke our social feeds with literally everything he did at Glastonbury, so it's easy to forget that Paul Mescal is yet to fully prove his mettle in the Hollywood arena. Judging by the trailer, that is about to change in a big, gym-toned way. He's both the soul and the raging id of a Ridley Scott sequel that finds his grown-up Lucius living in a kind of benevolence(ish) exile in Numidia in northwest Africa (an area that covers modern-day Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco). Is he happy? Lord no. 'Rage is your gift,' he hears. It's an understatement.\n\n'I never knew a mother or father,' Lucius tells Denzel Washington's gladiator-owning arms dealer and all-round schemer Macrinus, not entirely truthfully (mum Lucilla, played by Connie Nielsen, is back for the sequel). His brooding exile is shattered when the Roman fleet descends on Numidia and unleashes hell, a sequence that plays out in the trailer. Captured and dragged back to Rome, Lucius is forced to confront that long-buried past in the Colosseum. 'It's very [an] \"angry young man\" drama,' Mescal tells Vanity Fair. 'He's thrust back into that world and has direct proximity to all of the things that he thinks he hates.'\n\nRidley Scott describes Washington's Macrinus as a wealthy arms dealer with 'a stable of gladiators' - one of whom, Lucius, may just be his key to even greater power. Unlike Oliver Reed's gladiator trainer Proximo in the first movie, the Training Day star has his sights set on an entirely new political order. 'Rome must fall,' he says in the trailer, 'I need only give it a push.' Our guess would be that Macrinus and Lucius's objectives align in the film - until they don't.\n\nGladiator's gnarly hero, Russell Crowe's Maximus, may be enjoying eternal leave in Elysium with the family, but his long shadow still hangs over the sequel. The trailer opens with a flashback to his face-off with Joaquin Phoenix's villainous Emperor Commodus in the 2000 movie - this time seen through the eye of the young Lucius. 'I'll never forget that a slave could take revenge against a master,' recalls the older Lucius, now played by Paul Mescal. Clearly the young, gladiator-loving princeling has learnt from Maximus's insurgent spirit and will be channelling it in the sequel. Unlike Maximus, Lucius' motivation seems to be nothing less than the destruction of the imperial order. Are we about to hail a new Spartacus?\n\nReplacing Phoenix's Commodus as the antagonist are not one but two Emperors, both as twisted and sadistic as each other. Thelma's Fred Hechinger is Caracalla and Stranger Things star Joseph Quinn is his co-emperor, Geta. This malevolent duo - real-life brothers who ruled together from 209-211 AD - are no longer throwing bread to the crowds. We see them ordering Pedro Pascal's General Marcus Acacius, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Maximus's, to ramp up Rome's war efforts. 'Rome has so many subjects. She must feed them,' protests Acacius, to which Geta replies: 'They can eat war.' Has the nervy crowd pleasing of Commodus given way to a more sociopathic, Third Reich-y brand of populism?\n\nGladiator II will have to pull out the stops to top Gladiator's spectacular opening engagement - a 3-0 away win for the Romans over a disorganised German outfit - but on this evidence, Sir Ridley has pulled off another coup de cinema, with sea battles, rhino battles in the arena and battles on land. 'The film begins with the raiding party of the Roman fleet, which comes in from the sea and decimates Numidia,' Scott tells Vanity Fair. 'It's pretty gnarly.' Most exciting of all is the footage of the naumachia, sea battles that took place inside the Colosseum itself and which will pitch Lucius into struggle for survival amid turbulent waters, charging ships and flying arrows.\n\nThe first trailer is now online and you can watch it below.\n\nGladiator II is in Australian cinemas Nov 14, UK cinemas Nov 15, and US theaters Nov 22.", "source": {"uri":

The pair first squared off when Marcus led the Roman army to take Numidia -- the region of northern Africa where Lucilla sent Lucius as a boy -- and meet once again in the deadly Colosseum.\n\nGladiator II's other main antagonists are the twin brother co-emperors Caracalla (Fred Hechinger) and Geta (Joseph Quinn), cruel and power-hungry rulers, who, upon hearing that their people are starving, declare, \"They can eat war!\" (Geta also gleefully recreates Commodus' infamous thumbs down in the trailer.)\n\nWatch the full trailer below.\n\nET recently spoke with Mescal about his experience filming the sequel and he marveled at being a part of a new installment to a movie that has \"been in the cultural zeitgeist for 20 years.\"\n\n\"There's not a lot of films that have done that, especially in this genre,\" he reflected. \"So there's a healthy amount of pressure, but also a healthy amount of confidence from the people that made the film. We are excited to kind of add the next installment to a film that has been and will continue to be incredibly popular.\"\n\nOne person who is less than excited about the upcoming sequel, however, is Crowe.\n\nAt the end of the first Gladiator, Maximus succumbs to injuries he earned while leading a violent attempt to overthrow Commodus, meaning the Oscar winner's character could not return for the sequel -- a fact which has seemingly led to some skepticism from the actor.\n\n\"I'm slightly uncomfortable, the fact that they're making another one, you know?\" he admitted in a recent podcast interview. \"Because, of course, I'm dead, and I have no say in what gets done.\"\n\n\"But, a couple of things that I've heard, I'm like, 'No, no, no, no, no. That's not in the moral journey of that particular character,'\" he continued. \"But, you know, can't say anything. It's not my place. I'm six foot under. So we'll see what that is like.\"\n\nThe film also stars Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus, Tim McInnerny as Thraex and Alexander Karim as Ravi, plus Lior Raz, Peter Mensah, Matt Lucas, May Calamawy

I don't know if the sequel will be the same, because after Gladiator, there was a surge in stories about Rome and a revival of sword-and-sandal movies and TV shows. That being said... Ridley Scott did the thing. Behold, the first trailer for Gladiator 2, starring Paul Mescal, Pedro Pascal, Denzel Washington, Connie Nielsen and two very creepy young actors as co-Roman emperors.\n\nGET HYPE! I'll admit, I did not realize Denzel's role was so big. I thought it was going to be more like \"Ridley wanted Denzel in the movie, so Denzel has one good scene.\" It looks more like Denzel's character is orchestrating the downfall of the Roman Empire. HOT! Paul looks great in it, honestly and I'm interested to see if Pedro Pascal can pull off a Roman hottie.

It's stuffed with grudges and revenge fantasies, political intrigue and revolutionary fervor, decadence, depravity, and some of the most bonkers-looking action sequences you can imagine. Just within the bloody confines of the Coliseum, there's a makeshift naval battle, a charging rhinoceros, and some wildly intense hand-to-hand combat.\n\nGladiator II picks up with -- and centers around -- Lucius, played by Mescal. In the original movie, Lucius appeared briefly as the son of Connie Nielsen's Lucilla, daughter of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, former lover of Russell Crowe's Maximus, and sister to Joaquin Phoenix's dastardly Commodus (Nielsen will reprise her role in Gladiator II). After the events of the first movie, Lucilla sends her son away to live in Northern Africa without explanation, leaving him alone and resentful, but also with an indelible memory of Maximus' last stand.\n\n\"I remember that day,\" he says in the opening moments of the clip. \"I never forgot it. That a slave could take revenge against an emperor.\"\n\nAfter the new Roman emperors -- brothers played by Fred Hechinger and Joseph Quinn -- invade Lucius' home, he's forced into slavery and then becomes a gladiator. Along the way, he meets a Macrinus, a power broker and arms dealer played by Denzel Washington, and is ultimately put on a collision course with Pascal's Marcus Acacius, a Roman general who trained under Maximus and leads the invasion of Lucius' home.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_blistein@rollingstone.com", "name": "Jon Blistein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucilla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_emperor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roman emperor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naval warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magnus Maximus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Aurelius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhinoceros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hechinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Hechinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macrinus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arms industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GL2_07002R4.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

His latest film - following hot on the heels of Napoleon, which came hot on the heels of The Last Duel and House Of Gucci; the man's heels are permanently hot - is rumbling towards its big-screen release at the end of the year, and while we haven't seen a trailer yet (one screened to much applause at CinemaCon earlier in 2024), we now have the first official poster - a tantalising glimpse at new leading man Paul Mescal in the combat arena. Swords up, people.\n\nScott's sequel is set several decades after the previous film (it's no surprise, give its ending, that Russell Crowe is not returning), and centres on Mescal's Lucius Verus, grandson of former Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who is forced into slavery and seeks to follow in Maximus' footsteps to become a renowned gladiator. As we know, he'll be facing off in the arena with Pedro Pascal's Marcus Acacius. Also in the cast are Denzel Washington, Connie Nielsen, Derek Jacobi, Joseph Quinn, and Fred Hechinger.\n\nThe countdown is on, then, for the trailer to finally arrive - hopefully, it teases a sequel that can live up to Scott's beloved original (or, at least, the hit BBC gameshow Gladiators).

Gladiator II, Ridley Scott's sequel to his 2000 Oscar-conquering epic, is due in cinemas in November, but the promotional reel offers the first look proper at Paul Mescal, who has stepped into Russell Crowe's sandals.\n\nMescal plays Lucius, son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and the late Lucius Verus, who remembers watching the doomed heroics of Crowe's Maximus in the first movie. Inspired by his courage, the enslaved Lucius vows to defeat new preening emperors Caracalla (Joseph Quinn) and Geta (Fred Hechinger).\n\nIn his way - or, possibly, giving him a bit of a leg-up - are Denzel Washington's slave owner and power broker, Macrinus, who Scott has described as \"pretty fucking cruel\" to the arena fighters, as well as Pedro Pascal's Roman general, Marcus Acacius.\n\nPascal has described his character as \"a very, very good general, which can mean a very good killer\"; trained under Maximus, his push to invade north Africa puts him firmly in the crosshairs of Lucius, who Macrinus identifies as being so full of animus that \"rage is your gift\".\n\nMescal bulked up considerably for the role, earning the nickname \"Brick Wall Paul\", courtesy of Pascal. \"He got so strong,\" Pascal said of his co-star. \"I would rather be thrown from a building than have to fight him again.\"\n\nAlso featuring in the trailer are brief glimpses of Tim McInnerny and a returning Derek Jacobi, lots and lots of swords, arrows, ships, crowds, water, shouting and a massive bloodstained rhinoceros Lucius must defeat.\n\nThe trailer also offers a preview of the stirring soundtrack - again composed by Hans Zimmer, as well as a snatch of No Church in the Wild by Kanye West and Jay Z, featuring the apposite lyrics: \"Tears on the mausoleum floor / Blood stains the Colosseum doors.\"\n\nFilming began last June but was interrupted by the actors' strike in the US, before resuming in December and ending in January, some brief reshoots last month in Sussex notwithstanding.\n\nThe global release date is 22 November; it shares this date with the movie of the musical Wicked, which has moved forward a week to avoid competition with Moana 2.\n\nThe potential double bill has led many to predict another Barbenheimer marketing drive, though a decision on the portmanteau name - Wickiator or Gladicked - appears pending.", "source": {"uri": "ca.movies.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

That was it. We were away and running with the ball.\"\n\nMescal, 28, said his days playing Gaelic football had perhaps helped land him the part. He added: \"I'm used to being physical in my body.\"\n\nCrowe won an Oscar for his role as Maximus Decimus Meridius in the 2000 original.\n\nReaders can get thousands of free books and magazines with early Amazon Prime Day deal\n\nPaul said he is trying to get into the best shape of his life to take on the leading role in the upcoming sequel to Gladiator - but has confessed he's refusing to quit booze and cigarettes while preparing for the role.\n\nThe 27-year-old Irish actor is following in the footsteps of Russell Crowe to take on the lead role in the sequel to the 2000 film directed by Ridley Scott. The original film was a critical and commercial smash - raking in almost \u00a3400 million at the box office and winning praise from cinema goers.\n\nThe sequel will see Paul play Lucius Verus, the nephew of villainous Commodus, who was played by Joaquin Phoenix in the original film, and was played in the original film by American actor Spencer Treat Clark. And while the Normal People actor is working out to get in shape for the role, he is not abandoning his vices.\n\nPaul says he is working with a Personal Trainer, but was very clear he wouldn't be giving up alcohol or cigarettes while they were training. He told Esquire: \"I set the tone early. I smoke and drink and that's not going to change.\n\n\"I can't tell you how stressed I am talking about that film in particular, because it's definitely the biggest one I've done. I feel really excited.\"\n\nThe new film, which is duet for release next year, will see Connie Nielsen reprise her role from the original film to play Lucius's mother, Lucilla. While the new film will see Derek Jacobi back as Senator Gracchus, a member of the Roman Senate, and Djimon Hounsou as former gladiator Juba.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_jefferies@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mark Jefferies", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Verus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucius Verus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Treat_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spencer Treat Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djimon_Hounsou", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Djimon Hounsou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Jacobi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derek Jacobi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roman Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esquire (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33197388.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Gladiator-II.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

And for the great Ridley Scott to kind of pass the baton on to me is something that, like, my drama school self or even the version of myself that was 15 watching the film for the first time, could never have imagined.\"\n\nMescal shared that he took on the role of Lucius Verus -- Commodus' nephew who was sent away from Rome as a boy by his mother, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) -- with a \"great deal of pride.\" When Lucius' home in northern Africa is raided by the Roman army, he is brought back to Rome to fight in the Colosseum -- which also required an intense amount of physical training.\n\n\"There was a lot of work that went into it,\" the actor recalled. \"Lots of lifting heavy things... lots of squatting, pushing, pulling. We didn't kind of change the wheel with it, it was all kind of pretty standard in that regard, but I was keen for it not to look false or kind of overly aesthetic in any way.\"\n\nWorking with Gladiator II's all-star cast -- which also includes Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger and more -- was a pivotal experience for the Irish actor.\n\n\"I think for a lot of us, especially the younger cohort of the cast, we would easily say that it's a job that changed our lives,\" he marveled. \"We're kind of waiting with bated breath [for the release], but the thing that I keep coming back to is, we've done it. We've gone and made it and nobody can take that away from us. And we had the king that is Ridley Scott at the helm -- it's amazing.\"\n\nAs for his memories of the original, Mescal recalled, \"I remember watching it with my dad and being absolutely blown away by it.\"\n\n\"It's been in the cultural zeitgeist for 20 years, and there's not a lot of films that have done that especially in this genre,\" he added. \"So there's a healthy amount of pressure but also a healthy amount of confidence from the people that made the film.

It's absolutely bananas but I've seen the trailer and the film, I think the hype is kind of warranted.\n\n\"I'm as big of a fan of the first film as the next person and I think it's just indicative of the legacy that this film has.\n\n\"Ridley Scott directing a second one, for people who love film, it's a no-brainer.\"\n\nDirector Scott's epic received five Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor, as well as Bafta and Golden Globe success.\n\nMescal plays the son of Connie Nielsen's Lucilla in the new film and his fight for survival under the rule of tyrannical general Acacius is at the forefront, with the story taking place years after the first film ended.\n\nMescal said he loved the \"gruelling\" training for the mega role and admitted shaping up as a Roman warrior was a \"first world problem\", with first-look pics of his buff transformation sending fans into a frenzy.\n\nHe said: \"I had to eat a lot! I put on about a stone, I had to lift a lot of heavy things and run around.\n\n\"I had a team of people around who were telling me to eat what when, run where, run how far, lift this heavy thing for x amount of times.\n\n\"When you're talking about films of this scale you have a team of experts around you who support your entire process, so it was kind of a dream come true. There was no stone left unturned.\"\n\nThe official trailer for the sequel - released today - sent fans into a frenzy with footage of bloody sword fights and a rampaging rhino in the Colosseum in front of thousands of spectators baying for blood.\n\nThe star-studded cast also includes Denzel Washington, Derek Jacobi, Joseph Quinn, Fred Hechinger, and Lior Raz.\n\nAnd Mescal's co-star Pedro Pascal admitted it was \"brutal\" to go up against Mescal in fight scenes.\n\nHe said: \"I call him Brick Wall Paul. He got so strong. I would rather be thrown from a building than have to fight him again.\n\n\"To go up against somebody that fit and that talented and that much younger... Outside of Ridley being a total genius, Paul is a big reason as to why I would put my poor body through that experience.\"\n\nAnd GAA ace Paul, who lined out for his county at underage level, revealed his \"useful\" Gaelic background could have played a part in him nabbing the role.\n\nHe said: \"I'm well used to throwing myself around on a pitch and that was useful in the Colosseum of Ancient Rome for sure.\n\n\"Lots of blood and dirt covered sweaty men running around for two and a half hours.\"\n\nAnd the 28-year-old had to meet certain grooming requirements for the new film.\n\nHe explained how his beard was \"all natural, telling Dave Moore on Today FM: \"I grew out the beard for what felt like 10 years. Jana and Julianna who did hair and makeup on this were just next level.\"\n\nAnd ahead of his biggest role to date, he said he feels an \"overwhelming sense of support\" for Irish artists both at home and abroad.\n\nHe said: \"I've said this many times, I feel incredibly proud to be Irish. Going from sausage ads to this wasn't in the bingo card for me.\n\n\"Me and Andrew Scott both spoke about this, coming home to do the All Of Us Strangers premiere last year. I think I'm absolutely biased, but I think we have the most extraordinary country.\n\n\"People who are deeply supportive of the artists that we have and we're kind of as a country punching far above our weight in terms of the output and long may it continue and it should be supported because we've got immense talent for such a small country.\n\n\"I definitely feel an overwhelming sense of support from people back home and I can't wait to take the film there to be honest.\"\n\nAs for what fans can expect from Gladiator 2, he said: \"I think what they [audiences] should expect is that it picks the world of the first Gladiator up and plants it 20 years into the future.\n\n\"It has the same energy and spirit of the first one but the character's journey through the mad world that is Ancient Rome couldn't be more different.\n\n\"It balances an honouring of the first film but is very much its own beast and it very much is a beast of a film.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType":

The Ridley Scott sequel is set years after Maximus Decimus Meridius met his end following a battle in the Colosseum and also features the likes of Pedro Pascal, Denzel Washington, Connie Nielsen and Joseph Quinn.\n\nMescal said he gained a stone for the part, which he did by eating \"a lot\" and lifting \"lots of heavy things\".\n\n\"When you're talking about films of this scale, you have a team of experts around you who support your entire process so it was kind of a dream come true,\" he told Today FM's Dave Moore.\n\nThe Kildare man also said he had to grow out his beard for the much-anticipated film for \"what felt like 10 years\".\n\n\"It was all natural believe it or not. Jana and Julianna who did hair and makeup on this were just next level. Lots of blood and dirt-covered sweaty men running around for 2 and half hours.\"\n\nWhen asked by Moore whether it was his GAA career that helped him secure the role, Mescal said: \"I'm well used to kind of throwing myself around on a pitch. That was useful in the Colosseum in ancient Rome, for sure.\"\n\nScott, the film's director, previously admitted that Mescal appeared on his radar when he watched Normal People. For Irish people, however, he first came to our screens on a Denny sausages advertisement.\n\n\"Going from sausage ads to this wasn't in the bingo card for me.\" He also said Ireland is the \"most extraordinary country\" and that he's proud to be an Irishman.\n\n\"People who are deeply supportive of the artists that we have and we're kind of as a country punching far above our weight in terms of the output and long may it continue and it should be supported because we've got immense talent for such a small country.\n\n\"I definitely feel an overwhelming sense of support from people back home and I can't wait to take the film there, to be honest.\"\n\nFirst look images shared by Vanity Fair last week showed Mescal's Lucius washing his hands in the sand, just as Crowe's Maximus once did, as well as himself and Pascal, who plays Marcus Acacius, a Roman general said to have trained as a junior officer under Crowe's character, drawing blood in a sword fight.\n\nThe official trailer is due to be released today, 9 July, with plenty of excitement building ahead of its release date in November this year. Mescal said: \"It's new territory for me. It's absolutely bananas but I've seen the trailer and the film, I think the hype is kind of warranted.\n\n\"I'm as big of a fan of the first film as the next person and I think it's just indicative of the legacy that this film has. Ridley Scott directing a second one, for people who love film, it's a no-brainer.\"\n\nHe explained that the sequel \"picks the world of the first Gladiator up and plants it 20 years into the future\".\n\n\"It has the same energy and spirit of the first one but the character's journey through the mad world that is Ancient Rome couldn't be more different. It balances an honouring of the first film but is very much its own beast and it very much is a beast of a film.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_daly@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Rebecca Daly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colosseum"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnus Maximus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_FM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Today FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sausage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sausage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kildare", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County Kildare"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Kildare"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(filmmaking)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (filmmaking)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Rome"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blaise Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Banana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8394/4197217_3_articlelarge_2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 2250, "textEnd": 2256}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

I would rather be thrown from a building than have to fight him again,\" Pascal said. \"To go up against somebody that fit and that talented and that much younger....It's brutal, man. I call him Brick Wall Paul.\"\n\nHe also went to credit Mescal with helping him to get through the film's brutal fight scenes.\n\n\"Outside of Ridley being a total genius, Paul is a big reason as to why I would put my poor body through that experience,\" he explained.\n\nMescal also opened up to the publication about his transformation for the role.\n\n\"I just wanted to be big and strong and look like somebody who can cause a bit of damage when shit hits the fan,\" Mescal said. \"I think also, sometimes, one could, in striving for that perfect look, end up looking more like an underwear model than a warrior.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Muscles start to grow, and that can be deemed aesthetic in certain capacities, but there is something about feeling strong in your body that elicits just a different feeling. You carry yourself differently. It has an impact on you psychologically in a way that is useful for the film.\"\n\nRecently, Russell Crowe opened up about Gladiator II, saying that he was \"slightly uncomfortable\" that a sequel was being made.\n\nSpeaking to Kyle Meredith, Crowe said: \"I'm slightly uncomfortable with the fact they're making another one -- because, of course, I'm dead and I have no say in what gets done. But a couple of the things I've heard I'm like 'No, no, no, that's not in the moral journey of that particular character'. But I can't say anything, it's not my place, I'm six foot under. So we'll see what that is like.\"\n\nCrowe continued: \"I reflect back: the age I was when I made that film and all the things that came after it, the doors that particular movie opened for me. This is just me being purely honest: there's definitely a tinge of melancholy, a tinge of jealousy. I remember when I had tendons.\"\n\nIn January, Mescal also shared his concern about the fame which may come with the epic sequel. Speaking to The Sunday Times, the Irish actor said about the film's upcoming release: \"I don't know what the difference will be. Maybe that's naive? Is it just that more people will stop you in the street?\"\n\nHe continued: \"I'd get profoundly depressed if that's so and hope it isn't true. I'll have an answer next year, but if [the film] impacts my life in that way, I'll be in a bad spot.

This morning, Paramount Pictures saw fit to drop the first official trailer for director Ridley Scott's epic sequel \"Gladiator II\" and, yes, we are very entertained. Set decades after the events of the 2001 original, the follow-up film is set to pick up roughly where Russell Crowe's Roman general-turned-freedom-fighter Maximus Decimus Meridius left off, who (uh, spoiler alert) valiantly gave his life in the arena to end the reign of terror enacted by Joaquin Phoenix's unhinged Emperor Commodus. We'll now be looking through the perspective of up-and-coming star Paul Mescal as Lucius, who appears to be gearing up for a violent arc similar to the one the legendary Maximus navigated all those years ago. But trailers can be misleading, as we all know, and something tells us that there's much more than meets the eye here. The safe bet is to assume that Scott and screenwriter David Scarpa still have plenty hidden up their sleeves.\n\nThe thrilling footage packs in quite a lot of action into its lengthy three-minute runtime, focusing on everything from Lucius taking on gladiatorial rhinos armored for war to a thoroughly energetic Denzel Washington boasting some incredibly sleazy-looking vibes (complimentary) to Pedro Pascal kicking some butt and looking fabulous as he does so. The vast amount of characters we meet before quickly moving on to the next, however, deserves a much closer look. Those who haven't popped in the original \"Gladiator\" recently or closely followed the production of the sequel may be wondering who's back, who plays who, and what we can expect this time around.\n\nSo grab a handful of Colosseum sand and strap on your sword, because this \"Gladiator II\" character guide is the one for you.", "source": {"uri": "slashfilm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slashfilm"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Magnus Maximus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wheat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Scarpa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Scarpa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commodus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screenwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colosseum"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/gladiator-ii-character-guide-who-plays-who-in-ridley-scotts-epic-sequel/l-intro-1720539767.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

While it might seem like the rhino is just a creative flourish, exotic animals were actually a pretty huge part of gladiator battles in ancient Rome.\n\nThough they weren't initially a factor, wild animals -- including apex predators like lions -- became a part of gladiator fights thanks to some specific Roman emperors; in fact, some gladiators even fought sharks in flooded arenas (which can be very briefly spotted in the \"Gladiator 2\" trailer as well).

I will be there no matter what.\"\n\nThe fervour continues with a fan issuing a playful warning: \"Apologies in advance for the person I'll become after this comes out,\" reports OK!.\n\nAdmiration for the promotional art was evident, with one fan complimenting: \"They know what they doing w/ this poster @paramountpics,\" alongside fiery emojis.\n\nOne enthusiast shared their family's excitement: \"YAAAAY SO EXCITED. My parents are huge fans of this franchise, can't wait to watch together, specially having my fav actor in it @josephquinn.\"\n\nThe film, which also stars Pedro Pascal, Denzel Washington, Connie Nielson, Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger, is directed by Ridley Scott. It picks up years after the original film, following the death of Maximus Decimus Meridius (played by Russell Crowe), who sacrificed his life to overthrow the Roman empire's leadership.\n\nPaul takes on the role of an adult Lucius, the son of Maximus and his wife Lucilla (played by Connie Nielsen). The original film, released in 2000, was a box office hit, raking in $465.4million worldwide and becoming the second highest-grossing film of that year, just behind Mission: Impossible 2.\n\nThe film was not only a commercial success but also a critical one, with praise for its acting, direction, cinematography, production design and musical score. It bagged five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Costume Design and Best Actor for Russell.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OK!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hechinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Hechinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Costume_Design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Costume Design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Picture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_designer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Production designer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinematography"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/article33199700.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_russell-crowe-gladiator.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Gladiator II, Ridley Scott's sequel to his 2000 Oscar-conquering epic, is due in cinemas in November, but the promotional reel offers the first look proper at Paul Mescal, who has stepped into Russell Crowe's sandals.\n\nMescal plays Lucius, son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and the late Lucius Verus, who remembers watching the doomed heroics of Crowe's Maximus in the first movie. Inspired by his courage, the enslaved Lucius vows to defeat new preening emperors Caracalla (Joseph Quinn) and Geta (Fred Hechinger).\n\nIn his way - or, possibly, giving him a bit of a leg-up - are Denzel Washington's slave owner and power broker, Macrinus, who Scott has described as \"pretty fucking cruel\" to the arena fighters, as well as Pedro Pascal's Roman general, Marcus Acacius.\n\nPascal has described his character as \"a very, very good general, which can mean a very good killer\"; trained under Maximus, his push to invade north Africa puts him firmly in the crosshairs of Lucius, who Macrinus identifies as being so full of animus that \"rage is your gift\".\n\nMescal bulked up considerably for the role, earning the nickname \"Brick Wall Paul\", courtesy of Pascal. \"He got so strong,\" Pascal said of his co-star. \"I would rather be thrown from a building than have to fight him again.\"\n\nAlso featuring in the trailer are brief glimpses of Tim McInnerny and a returning Derek Jacobi, lots and lots of swords, arrows, ships, crowds, water, shouting and a massive bloodstained rhinoceros Lucius must defeat.\n\nThe trailer also offers a preview of the stirring soundtrack - again composed by Hans Zimmer, as well as a snatch of No Smoke in the Wild by Kanye West and Jay Z, featuring the apposite rap lyrics: \"Tears on the mausoleum floor / Blood stains the Colosseum doors.\"\n\nFilming began last June but was interrupted by the actors' strike in the US, before resuming in December and ending in January, some brief reshoots last month in Sussex notwithstanding.\n\nThe global release date is 22 November; it shares this date with the movie of the musical Wicked, which has moved forward a week to avoid competition with Moana 2.\n\nThe potential double bill has led many to predict another Barbenheimer marketing drive, though a decision on the portmanteau name - Wickiator or Gladicked - appears pending.", "source": {"uri":

It picks up years after the original film, following the death of Maximus Decimus Meridius (played by Russell Crowe), who sacrificed his life to overthrow the Roman empire's leadership.\n\nPaul takes on the role of an adult Lucius, the son of Maximus and his wife Lucilla (played by Connie Nielsen). The original film, released in 2000, was a box office hit, raking in $465.4million worldwide and becoming the second highest-grossing film of that year, just behind Mission: Impossible 2.\n\nThe film was not only a commercial success but also a critical one, with praise for its acting, direction, cinematography, production design and musical score. It bagged five Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Costume Design and Best Actor for Russell.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hamaiz_iqbal@ok.co.uk", "name": "Hamaiz Iqbal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hechinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fred Hechinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Quinn_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph Quinn (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Costume_Design", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Costume Design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Roman Empire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Picture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_designer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Production designer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinematography"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/tv/article33199641.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_russell-crowe-gladiator.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

If you are fit, you'll get put into some kind of service, as in slavery, or you would go into the arena to die.\"\n\nHe adds: \"The wrinkle is, when he gets to Rome as a prisoner and has a first round in the arena, he sees his mother -- to his shock. He doesn't know whether she's alive or not. How would he know? You don't have telephones. There's no press. And there's his mother in the royal box looking pretty good after 20 years.

But, really, there's something that stands out above the rest: Denzel Washington's line reading of the two-word phrase \"Too much.\" Most of this trailer operates in low, ominous tones befitting an epic of epic proportion. Not enough Denzel. In the middle of a conversation with Paul Mescal, who claims he wants the heads of \"the entire Roman army,\" Washington goes up an octave, telling Mescal, \"Too much!\" with a wicked smirk and a voice crack. It's a choice that runs exactly counter to the expected one, and it provides an auditory friction that this baritone movie wouldn't otherwise have. Plus, it's silly and whimsical!\n\nIf you're excited to see more of Ridley Scott's Gladiator II (or even if you just want to see more Denzel Washington line readings), the film starring Mescal, Pascal, Washington, and Quinn alongside Connie Nielsen debuts in theaters on November 22. Notably, that's the same day as Wicked: Part One, and no #Barbenheimer, but we'd recommend seeing them on the same day. The only thing that could make this bloody masculine feud even better is seeing it pale in comparison to utter female loathing.", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_p_frank@vulture.com", "name": "Jason P.

While the trailer leaves much to the imagination, much of the main cast gets a moment to shine, including Pedro Pascal as Roman general Marcus Acacius.\n\nGladiator II follows the secret son of Russell Crowe's Maximus, Lucius Verus (played by Paul Mescal), and his exploits to escape his role as a gladiator and get revenge. Like Maximus, Lucius lost his home and possibly his family due to an invasion led by Pascal's Acacius. As a result, Lucius starts a revenge quest with his sights set on Acacius.\n\nPascal's Acacius doesn't have much time to showcase his motivations in the trailer, aside from a few shots of him attacking Lucius' home. That said, he shines in key shots, such as one that shows off a regal gold and white armor complete with a gold leaf tiara.\n\nThis outfit is hard not to notice, especially for fans, as well as it's presence in many of Acacius' scenes in the trailer where he speaks to the emperors of a failing Rome and also oversees the combat in the coliseum.\n\nLater in the trailer, Acacius is also shown dodging an arrow from Lucius as the latter chooses to face him in combat. After that, Acacius takes on a small group of gladiators, giving viewers a taste of his combat skill but also the risk that Lucius will face against him.", "source": {"uri": "remezcla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Remezcla"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicholas_brooks@remezcla.com", "name": "Nicholas Brooks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacius_of_Constantinople", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acacius of Constantinople"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_(praenomen)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucius (praenomen)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_Maximus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Magnus Maximus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Verus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucius Verus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_leaf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold leaf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://remezcla.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Pedro-Pascal-SAG-Awards.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

That was useful in the Colosseum.\n\n'I had to eat a lot, I put on about a stone. I had a team of people around who were telling me to eat what, when, run when, run how far, lift this heavy thing X amount of times.\n\n'When you're talking about a film of this scale, there's a team of experts around you who support your entire process. It was a dream come true, there was no stone left unturned.'\n\nFirst breaking onto the scene during the pandemic in the TV adaption of Sally Rooney's Normal People, the Kildare native has gone on to receive critical acclaim in the world of film.\n\nWith Gladiator 2 rumoured to have a budget of up to $300 million and boasting a supporting cast of Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal and Connie Nielsen, Paul admitted the film is 'new territory' for him.\n\n'It's absolutely bananas. I've seen the trailer and the film, from my end the hype is warranted. I'm as big a fan of the first film as the next person. It's indicative of the legacy the film has. Ridley Scott directing a second one to a beloved film is a no-brainer,' he said.\n\nHe added: 'It picks the world of the first Gladiator up 20 years in the future, it has the same energy and spirit of the first one. The characters' journey through the mad world that is ancient Rome couldn't be more different. It balances honouring the first film with being very much its own beast. It is a beast of a film.'\n\nDespite the pressure of leading one of the biggest films of the decade, Paul is grateful to have the support of film fans back home in his native country.\n\n'I feel incredibly proud to be Irish. Going from sausage ads to this wasn't in the bingo cards for me. Coming home to do the All Of US Strangers premiere last year, I'm biased but I think we have the most extraordinary people who are deeply supportive of the artists we have.\n\n'We're kind of as a country punching far above our weight in terms of the output. Long may it continue and it should be supported because we've got immense talent for such a small country. I feel an overwhelming sense of support from people back home and I can't wait to take the film out here,' he said.", "source": {"uri": "extra.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Extra.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gladiator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colosseum"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kildare", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "County Kildare"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Kildare"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Mescal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Mescal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_FM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Today FM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(filmmaking)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (filmmaking)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Crowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ridley Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nobility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Rooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sally Rooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Nielsen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connie Nielsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Pascal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pedro Pascal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Banana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ancient Rome"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://extra.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Gladiator-II-7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712267", "eventUri": "eng-9712267", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

We finally got a look at the \"Gladiator II\" trailer today and to say that it looks wild would be an understatement. Scott has upped the action while assembling a stellar ensemble cast led by Paul Mescal (\"All of Us Strangers\"), Pedro Pascal (\"The Mandalorian\"), and Denzel Washington (\"The Equalizer\").\n\nWhile Scott clearly isn't going for overall historical accuracy here, these films are based loosely on what happened in Ancient Rome during these storied gladiator battles. The trailer features some particularly wild moments, including a rhino being let loose in the arena. But the wildest moment comes early when the arena is flooded to simulate a navy battle, with huge war ships and dozens of men duking it out for the Romans to watch.\n\nThe footage makes it clear that Scott made the most of the outrageous budget for \"Gladiator II,\" as this sequence looks like true blockbuster magic. The filmmaker clearly did his research and, even if he cherry-picked what parts of history he wanted to honor and which ones he wanted to change for the sake of a narrative, this is indeed something that the Romans witnessed, or at least some version of it.

This coming November, who's ready to be Gladicked? Since it proved so lucrative last time, two of the biggest films of 2024, Gladiator II and Wicked, are being released on the same date, November 15 - though in the UK, we're getting Ridley Scott's Roman spectacular one week early, so in the ensuing box office duel it will have a slight head start.\n\nMany of us assumed that Gladiator II would be the Oppenheimer of the pair: epic, stern and magisterial, and likelier to win round Oscar and Bafta voters in the new year. But in the hotly anticipated first trailer, the Kenergy is frankly off the charts. Think sun, sand, rowing boats, dinky tunics, and more glistening abs than have seen the inside of a cinema since Ryan Gosling's dance-off.\n\nHints of plot are dangled. We're introduced firstly to Lucius, the son of Russell Crowe's Maximus and Connie Nielsen's Lucilla, who as a child unwittingly watched his father fight in the arena during the original 2000 film. Sent out of the city for his own protection, this one-time heir to Rome grows into Paul Mescal, and becomes mixed up with Denzel Washington's Macrinus - a plotter and powerbroker who keeps a stable of gladiators, and sees Lucius as the key to toppling the empire itself. \"Rome must fall,\" he purrs. \"I need only give it a push.\"\n\nHigher up the sales agenda than political and familial intrigue, though, is the spectacle - and the trailer delivers oodles of that. The already touted Mescal-versus-rhinoceros fight is previewed, but it's outshone by a (historically accurate, amazingly) depiction of the colosseum being flooded for a staged naval battle, with gladiators rowing galleys while what look like sharks and/or crocodiles circle the vessels.\n\nThis bread-and-circuses pageantry is clever contrasted with a real-world military engagement, as galleons carrying soldiers pound at a North African coastal city's fortified walls. This invading force is led by Pedro Pascal's general Marcus Acacius, who takes his orders from Geta and Caracalla, Joseph Quinn and Fred Hechinger's fey-slash-savage brother-emperors, adding a top note of psycho-camp to the thunderous proceedings.\n\nFrom the opening shot of Mescal eyeing Crowe's iconic sword as it hangs on a torchlit catacomb wall to the closing promise of decapitation, the whole thing blares Major Work Inbound. And for a number of parties, Gladiator II's commercial and critical fate is as onerous as whether Rome stands or falls. At 86, Ridley Scott is busier than ever, but despite a recent run of strong work including Alien Covenant, The Last Duel and Napoleon, the director is long overdue a hit on the scale of 2015's The Martian: this could be it.\n\nMeanwhile, the 28-year-old Mescal has yet to be tested as a mainstream box office draw, despite emerging in recent years as one of Gen-Z's favourite heartthrobs. Aftersun, All of Us Strangers and (on television) Normal People have built the Irish actor an ardent fanbase who are doubtless already going feral on social media over screen grabs from the trailer. But can they be coaxed out to the cinema en masse, and will they bring their friends?\n\nDavid Ellison will certainly be hoping so. The new owner of Paramount Pictures, and CEO of the heavy-hitting production company Skydance, will be keen to prove his new acquisition can produce major works that hit that Barbenheimer three-way sweet spot: critical acclaim, commercial domination, and meme-able cultural cachet.\n\nThey managed in 2022 with Top Gun: Maverick - a Skydance production, notably - and today's trailer, I think, bodes well for more of that. As Hollywood continues to scramble to find a path forward from the franchise era, nothing less will be Kenough.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

Rumors that its already massive budget had ballooned to as much as $310 million -- which would mean it would have to be one of 2024's highest-grossing movies just to break even, never mind making a profit -- may have suggested that the film was in trouble, but an early screening of the preview at the CinemaCon convention in Las Vegas reassured exhibitors and studios alike, with the few journalists who had seen the footage rushing to extol its scale and grandeur. Now it's been released online, and viewers have a chance to judge for themselves. (Its cinematic debut will come with Deadpool vs Wolverine.) Does it look like a worthy follow-up to Gladiator?\n\nTo be frank, it would be nigh-on impossible to compete with the original, but that is because the success of the Oscar-winning behemoth is a more subtle and complex thing than it was given credit for. Its central revenge storyline was something out of Death Wish \u00ad\u00ad -- man trained in the violent arts has wife and child killed; man gives into violent impulses; everyone who gets in his way suffers -- but it was elevated to artistic respectability by its peerless technical accomplishment, a script that neatly balanced profundity and quotability and performances by veteran British actors like Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed, who could give gravitas to General Hospital. And, of course, it boasted an award-winning performance at its center by Russell Crowe as a terrifying instrument of vengeance, who hacked, slashed and decapitated his way through the picture as he sought revenge on Joaquin Phoenix's sniveling, incestuous-intended emperor Commodus.\n\nCrowe will, of course, not be returning for the Gladiator sequel, on account of his character Maximus dying heroically at the conclusion of the first one, his job done. Yet judging by this preview, his influence will be keenly felt throughout, whether it's Paul Mescal's Lucius (apparently his son, although this has not yet been publicly revealed) gazing awestruck at the legendary general-turned-gladiator's armor, or the massed ranks of fighters declaring \"Strength and honor,\" the original's catchphrase, as they prepare to face their adversaries. And there are countless other callbacks to the first film, too, from Lucius's double-sword decapitation technique to the reappearance of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, Maximus's former lover and Lucius's mother.\n\nIt all looks vastly expensive, with sea battles and scenes of siege warfare that may feature CGI embellishment but also have thousands of extras and a reassuring amount of bloody peril right up on the screen. Mescal, who is a critical favorite after his roles in Normal People and All Of Us Strangers but has yet to make his blockbuster debut, may not quite be measuring up to Crowe for sheer force of charisma on this evidence, but the always-welcome presence of Denzel Washington as a mysterious powerbroker who seems intent on seizing power from the corrupt but effete emperors indicates that the sub-I, Claudius politicking that made the first film such a pleasure to watch will be returning here, with a vengeance.\n\nThere will be an awful lot riding on this picture's success. The beleaguered Paramount Pictures desperately needs a hit, and for the film to make serious money, it needs to bank Oppenheimer-level amounts. And there is something of a question mark over the now-eighty-six-year-old Scott, too, who appears in recent years to have gone for broke in emphasizing the comic aspects of everything from Napoleon's conquest of Europe to the murder of Maurizio Gucci by his wife Patrizia. Few would relish the prospect of Gladiator II being turned into the British sitcom Up, Pompeii. But judged on the evidence of this fiery, propulsive trailer -- and I haven't even mentioned Pedro Pascal as Mescal's nemesis, offering two muscled gladiators for the price of one -- then Crowe's outraged bellow from the first film of \"Are you not entertained?\" will find an enthusiastic response in the affirmative from audiences worldwide in a few months' time.

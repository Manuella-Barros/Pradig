Hsu.\n\nCitigroup will pay the OCC $75 million and the Fed $60.6 million, on top of $400 million Citigroup previously paid as part of the 2020 consent order.\n\nFraser responded Wednesday with her own statement, saying that \"we've always said that progress wouldn't be linear, and we have no doubt that we will be successful in getting our firm where it needs to be in terms of our transformation.\"\n\nThe CEO added that \"we're committed to spending what is necessary to address our consent orders.\"\n\nCitigroup's stock dropped more than 1% in after-hours trading Wednesday. Its stock has risen more than 26% since the beginning of the year, outperforming all other big bank rivals.\n\nThe slap from regulators comes as Citigroup tries to pull off a dramatic transformation meant to revive its stock price and remove decades of bloat.\n\nThe makeover under Fraser, who took over as boss in March 2021, began roughly two years ago as she tried to focus the company on serving big, multinational corporations, shed what wasn't profitable, and operate more efficiently.\n\nThat meant pulling back from consumer banking in various parts of the world. It also meant cutting jobs and reorganizing business lines as part of an internal restructuring that Fraser called the \"most consequential\" change to how Citigroup operated in nearly two decades.\n\nThe strategy amounted to an unwinding of a 1990s-era \"financial supermarket\" that claimed to offer any and all services needed by consumers, businesses, and governments.\n\nIts most recent effort to convince investors it was heading in the right direction came last month as Fraser and other bank executives made a series of investor presentations focused primarily on its multinational services division, which helps corporations move money around the world.\n\nCFO Mark Mason in his presentation referred to 2024 as an \"inflection year\" and said by 2026 Citigroup plans to grow its full-year revenue by at least $6 billion while lowering its expenses by at least $500 million.\n\nBut both Fraser and Mason also acknowledged at the June event that the bank still had work to do to bolster its regulatory and compliance functions.\n\n\"We recognize there are places where progress has been too slow, so we have intensified our efforts in areas such as regulatory processes and the related data remediation,\" Fraser said in June.\n\nAnother regulatory blow came days later when regulators found weaknesses in \"living wills\" submitted by Citigroup and three other large banks detailing how the lenders would wind themselves down if something catastrophic were to happen.\n\nThe shortcomings in the 2023 plans happened when banks were asked to simulate an unwind of their derivatives and trading positions in two scenarios with different time frames.\n\nIn the case of Citigroup, regulators said the weakness had to do with a shortcoming identified in its 2021 plan \"regarding resolution data integrity and data management issues.\"\n\nThe FDIC said it found Citigroup's plan weak enough to be considered a more serious \"deficiency,\" while the Fed stuck with the less severe \"shortcoming\" rating.\n\nDavid Hollerith is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance covering banking, crypto, and other areas in finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

(NYSE:C) has been subjected to a total of $135 million in civil money penalties as per the latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The penalties were imposed following consent orders by two major U.S. financial regulators on Wednesday.\n\nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued a penalty of $60,625,620 against Citigroup. Concurrently, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) imposed a separate $75 million penalty on Citibank, N.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Citigroup.\n\nAdditionally, Citibank is required to comply with an amendment to the OCC Consent Order dated October 7, 2020. This amendment stipulates that Citibank must submit a Resource Review Plan within 30 days. It also sets forth specific conditions regarding potential capital distributions from Citibank to other Citigroup entities.\n\nThe details of the consent orders and the amendment were included as exhibits in the 8-K filing, which serves as the source of this information. The financial implications for Citigroup stem from these regulatory actions, and the company has not provided any further comment on the matter as of the filing date.\n\nThe SEC filing indicates that these enforcement actions are part of ongoing regulatory oversight of Citigroup's operations by federal agencies. The bank is expected to fulfill the requirements of the amended consent order and pay the assessed penalties.\n\nInvestors and stakeholders in Citigroup are advised to review the official SEC filings for a comprehensive understanding of the events and their implications. The company's stock performance and future regulatory compliance efforts may be influenced by these developments.\n\nIn other recent news, Citigroup Inc has been hit with a $136 million fine due to unresolved data issues. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency imposed this fine, citing insufficient improvements in the bank's data management systems. This follows a previous $400 million fine in 2020 for similar reasons.\n\nIn a separate development, Citigroup's indicative Stress Capital Buffer (SCB) requirement has been reduced to 4.1%, down from 4.3%. This change will take effect in October 2024. The bank also plans to raise its quarterly common stock dividend from $0.53 to $0.56 per share starting in Q3 2024.\n\nCitigroup confirmed the departure of Peter Cai, the bank's head of risk data, analytics, reporting, and technology, amid a significant reorganization effort. This comes as the bank faces regulatory scrutiny over its data management and risk control processes.\n\nThe bank is also set to earn a portion of up to $40 million in fees from advising on Hyundai Motor (OTC:HYMTF)'s upcoming IPO in India. This could significantly contribute to India's total IPO fee income.\n\nFinally, Citigroup, along with other major U.S. banks, is expected to maintain ample capital reserves following the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests. This is despite economic and regulatory uncertainties that have led banks to be conservative with shareholder payouts.\n\nAmidst the recent regulatory scrutiny, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) presents a mixed financial outlook. With a market capitalization of $127.68 billion, Citigroup is a prominent player in the banking industry. Despite concerns over cash burn, as indicated by an InvestingPro Tip, the company has maintained dividend payments for 14 consecutive years, showcasing its commitment to shareholder returns. This is supported by a current dividend yield of 3.19%.\n\nInvestors may also take note of the company's stock performance, which has seen significant appreciation. With a price near its 52-week high, Citigroup has returned 52.06% to shareholders over the last year. This could be a point of interest for those looking at the company's short-term price momentum.\n\nHowever, analysts have tempered expectations, with five revising their earnings downwards for the upcoming period, another InvestingPro Tip that could signal caution.

The same regulators fined Citi US$400 million at the time.\n\nThe bank still suffers from \"certain persistent weaknesses,\" particularly on data, said Acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu.\n\n\"Citibank must see through its transformation and fully address in a timely manner its longstanding deficiencies,\" Hsu said.\n\n\"Today's amendment requires the bank to refocus its efforts on taking necessary corrective actions and ensuring appropriate resources are allocated for this purpose.\"\n\nThe OCC described the latest action as a US$75 million civil monetary penalty, while the Fed fine was for US$60.6 million.\n\nCiti CEO Jane Fraser said the bank had made \"good progress\" but would do more to meet the requirements.\n\n\"We will get these areas where they need to be, as we have done in other areas of the transformation,\" Fraser said in a statement. \"We've always said that progress wouldn't be linear, and we have no doubt that we will be successful in getting our firm where it needs to be.\" AFP", "source": {"uri": "businesstimes.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citigroup", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Citigroup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internal control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Comptroller_of_the_Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Office of the Comptroller of the Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Charts_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official Charts Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citibank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citibank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/6bcb7f1e7c50d22a40ef022cdfecbbc3824dc33ab4ee830b23e2848396130f50", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722778", "eventUri": "eng-9722778", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-10-", "textStart": 487, "textEnd": 499}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 458348880, "relevance": 2}

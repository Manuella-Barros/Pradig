From his dominance on the court to his hilarious quips on the mic, the transition has been smooth. His pride in his game and being one of the most dominant big men in the history of the game still shows in his words, and he wants confirmation of it from others as well.\n\nDuring a recent episode of the Big Podcast with Shaq, the 7-footer wanted confirmation from his guest, JJ Redick, but the latter found himself in a sticky situation when Shaq threw a curveball at him. The 4-time NBA champion told Redick, \"So you probably got Dwight [Howard] over me as the Magic's best big man ever. Dare you to say it, dare you to say it.\"\n\nWhile Redick tried to tiptoe his way past the dare, Shaq pressed on by saying, \"The best Orlando Magic big man ever, say it it's only three - me, Dwight and Greg Kite.\" JJ Redick showed his quick wits and turned the conversation towards Shaq, who is one of the best players in the league and doesn't get many shoutouts.\n\nShaq's blunt attitude towards Dwight Howard is no secret ever since the two bickered over the tag of \"Superman\" and his question to DH12's former teammate was one of his mischievous ways of keeping that beef alive. But was Dwight Howard really better than Shaq during his Orlando career? A close inspection of their careers has the answer.\n\nShaquille O'Neal made his big break in the NBA with the Orlando Magic in 1992 after being the first overall draft pick. Averaging 27.2 points, 12.5 rebounds, and 2.8 blocks in 295 games for the Magic in his career, Shaq marked his territory as the best big man of his time. The 1993 Rookie Of The Year and 1995 Scoring Champion awards were his gains from his spell in Orlando as the team collectively failed to win a championship in those years. A move to the Lakers in 1996 ended his journey with the Magic, and after his heroics in the Gold and Purple threads, he is mainly associated with the LA franchise.\n\nApart from the similarity in size, Dwight Howard also had a similar career path to his predecessor. After being drafted overall first by the Magic in 2004, Howard became synonymous with the Orlando side. The center averaged 18.4 points, 13.0 rebounds, and 2.2 blocks in 621 games for the Magic while picking up 3 Defensive Player Of The Year awards from 2009-2011.\n\nHe also achieved the feat of winning back-to-back NBA blocks leader awards in 2009 and 2010 which Shaq never won. While Shaq was a more significant threat muscling his way forward, Dwight was a rebounding machine with excellent defensive ability around the rim.\n\nThanks to his stellar career with the Magic, Dwight Howard was the obvious choice to have his jersey retired, but Shaq earned that prestigious honor instead. That only soured their relationship, but Shaq recently revealed why he pokes at Howard at any given chance and, knowing the Big Aristotle, that won't come to an end anytime soon.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dwight Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Kite", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Kite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FotoJet-26-e1715071126782-1024x563.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550742", "eventUri": "eng-9550742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Howard and O'Neal have been in conflict for years, primarily due to the latter frequently criticizing the former. Recently, O'Neal stated that Howard never sought his guidance, which was brought up when Dwight appeared on Haslem\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s and Miller\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s podcast. It appears that O'Neal and Howard are once again at odds in their longtime battle.\u00c2\n\nThe careers of Shaquille O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neal and Dwight Howard share an uncanny resemblance, particularly in their early stages. They were both drafted by the same team, traded to the same team, and encountered similar coaches, conflicts, and challenges along the way.\u00c2 However, the primary similarity that drove a wedge between them seemed rather trivial: Dwight ascended to superstardom just as Shaq's career began to decline.\u00c2\n\nThe rivalry between O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neal and Howard originated during the 2008 Slam Dunk Contest. This was the earliest moment of global recognition as a rising star in the league for Dwight. Howard represented the Magic during the contest, donning a Superman shirt and cape while showcasing his skills.\u00c2\n\nShaq, who had already adopted the moniker of \"Superman\" perceived this as an act of stealing his identity, and since then, the situation has only become more absurd.\u00c2 This incident sparked a war of words that reignited every time the two players faced each other.\u00c2\n\nIf this seems foolish, the beef between them only intensified after O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neal retired from the league. Shaq swiftly transitioned into a role as a TNT personality and has since dedicated a significant amount of time to criticizing Dwight for his shortcomings, both in maintaining his superstar status and meeting O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neal's criteria for what constitutes a great NBA center. This ongoing feud has involved impersonations, rap battles, and some incredibly silly tweets and Instagram posts.\n\nThe two esteemed NBA icons have publicly challenged each other multiple times, with the most recent being Howard's accusation of Shaq being dishonest on Twitter. Shaq had asserted that Dwight never sought his guidance, yet the latter presented a contrasting narrative regarding their association with the legendary Los Angeles Lakers player.\u00c2\n\nHoward has often said that he has no issues with O'Neal, and repeated the sentiment on the recent podcast episode that he has tried to squash the beef multiple times with Shaq. Howard center has revealed his side of the story.\n\nThe conversation began when Miller said to Howard, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Shaq said that you never reached out to him for advice.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a lie,\u00e2\u20ac Howard said.\n\nMiller said he would not call O'Neal a liar. However, the three-time Defensive Player of the Year replied that he would. Howard confirmed that Shaq has lied about having contact with him.\u00c2 \u00c2\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153There hasn't been a time where Shaq has just reached out like that. I've reached out to Shaq myself on multiple occasions because I'm like what's the issue? Like, I understand the competitive side, but we don't even compete against each other, and it's like two different stratospheres.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nHoward continued,\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I have reached out to him. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s time for Shaq to get back on this now. I have reached out to him, and I would like for us to have some type of relationship. Life is too short and for us to be who we are, there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no way we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be able to work together in any capacity.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nAlthough Howard expressed his affection for O'Neal, his accusation of him being dishonest will surely not be well received. Similarly, Howard's comical remark about Shaq being a counterfeit Superman while discussing the retirement of his jersey by the Orlando Magic will also not be taken lightly.\n\n\"\u00e2\u20ac\"\u00e2\u20ac\"They finally retired the first jersey... The fake Superman.\"\"\n\nHoward expressed his belief that the Magic should have retired his jersey before O'Neal's, which clearly upset him. It's unclear whether Shaq was aware of Howard's comments, but he added fuel to the fire by suggesting that Penny Hardaway and Tracy McGrady should have their jerseys retired before Howard.\u00c2\n\nWhile this statement was absurd, it wasn't entirely surprising coming from him. During a recent episode of the show, Haslem and Howard reconcile their differences. UD acknowledged Howard's age, stating that he no longer holds a grudge against him, and congratulating him on his successful career. Howard was thrilled to hear this and expressed his desire to resolve the ongoing feud between himself and O'Neal as well.\n\n\"In the NBA, we're supposed to be brothers shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t be nothing more than a sibling rivalry,\" Howard said. \"Much love UD. Shaq let\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s end this. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been 50 years.\"\n\nHoward has expressed a desire to resolve their issues in the past, but no progress has been made. O'Neal has justified his behavior towards Dwight as tough love, but it seems more like disrespect from Howard's perspective.\n\nShaq even went as far as to say that Howard is not a Hall of Famer, which is simply ridiculous. In 2022, O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Neal promised not to hurt Howard's feelings again after Thanksgiving dinner with his mother. It was uncertain if this marked the end of their feud, but unfortunately, it was not. Howard reached out on social media to attempt to put an end to things, but O'Neal rebuffed him:\n\nOver the years, Shaq has consistently emphasized that Howard had never achieved a championship ring despite leading the Magic to the NBA Finals in 2009. However, this complaint is now invalid as Howard played a crucial role as a bench player for the team that emerged victorious in the 2020 NBA Finals.\u00c2 While the Lakers were celebrating their championship in the locker room, Howard took to Instagram and delivered an emotional message in the immediate aftermath.\n\nDuring an episode of The Big Podcast With Shaq, O'Neal strongly criticized Howard, labeling him a \"front-runner\" and a \"bandwagon jumper,\" and insinuated that he had no significant contribution to the Lakers' title.\u00c2\n\nHopefully, these two esteemed Orlando Magic legends can reconcile their differences and find common ground someday.", "source": {"uri": "allucanheat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "All U Can Heat"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Howard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dwight Howard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c2", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "\u00c2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udonis_Haslem", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Udonis Haslem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_Dunk_Contest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slam Dunk Contest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aristotle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u0152", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u0152"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Hardaway", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penny Hardaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_McGrady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tracy McGrady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2541,h_1429,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/115/01hxddfxh1g15hqhkgd3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550742", "eventUri": "eng-9550742", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Shaq's pride in his basketball legacy remains evident as he seeks validation from others, as seen in a recent episode of the Big Podcast with Shaq.\n\nDuring the podcast, Shaq playfully challenged his guest, JJ Redick, regarding who the best big man in Orlando Magic history is.

But was Howard truly better than Shaq during their time with the Magic? Let's compare their careers.\n\nShaq made his mark with the Orlando Magic in 1992, averaging impressive stats. Despite individual accolades, including Rookie of the Year and Scoring Champion awards, Shaq couldn't secure an NBA title with the Magic. His move to the Lakers in 1996 solidified his legacy with another franchise.\n\nDwight Howard followed a similar path after being drafted by the Magic in 2004. He became a defensive powerhouse, winning multiple Defensive Player of the Year awards and leading the league in blocks.

After all, the two have had fantastic careers playing for the Orlando Magic and the Los Angeles Lakers and have similar larger-than-life personalities. However, their relationship worsened when Shaq began criticizing Howard's play on national TV and belittling his accomplishments.\n\nHowever, despite the harsh criticism that sometimes bordered on bullying, Dwight shared that he tried to talk to the Hall of Famer about it and even sought his advice. But, according to D12, O'Neal never responded or reached out to him.\n\n\"No, there hasn't been a time where Shaq has just reached out like that.

Apparently, the other guy just didn't get the memo.\n\n\"You got to understand about me; when I'm serious, the world won't know. It'll just be me and you,\" O'Neal stated. \"A lot of times, I just be playing. So, am I serious when I talk about these guys? No, it's fun. I'm a fun guy.

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDwight Howard has had an illustrious career in the NBA. For almost 20 years, the big man asserted command over the paint and won multiple accolades. However, despite his achievements, the big man is perhaps best known for his famous feud with Shaquille O'Neal. Recently though, \"Superman\" learned that Shaq's former teammate, Udonis Haslem has also had a beef with him. However, despite his initial shock, Howard immediately seems to have used it as a tactic to try and bury the hatchet with 'The Big Diesel'.\n\nDuring Dwight Howard's recent appearance on \"The OGs\", Udonis Haslem made him aware of the hatred that the Miami Heat legend had for him. UD revealed that Howard's elbow caused damage to his eardrum in the middle of a game, resulting in surgery. Since then, Haslem always played with a 'chip on his shoulder' when going up against D12.\n\n\"We got beef. OG ain't ducking no smoke... Dwight, my fifth year in the league, we competing against you - caught me with an elbow in my ear. I end up getting a burst eardrum, a perforated eardrum. I end up having to have surgery. So every time I played against you, I always had a little bit of a chip on my shoulder,\" Haslem revealed.\n\nDespite his grudge, with it having been years after the incident took place, Haslem revealed he was ready to put the altercation behind both of them.\n\n\"Ain't no smoke, man. It's all love, brother. Let's do what we do out here in life, man,\" Haslem concluded.\n\nAfter his beef with Udonis Haslem came to an end, Dwight posted the clip of the podcast, urging Shaquille O'Neal also to do the same. By writing how the misunderstandings in the NBA were nothing more than 'sibling rivalry', the Orlando Magic legend hoped to make peace with Shaq after \"50 years\". The following is what he said on the matter in his X [Formerly Twitter] post.\n\n\"In the NBA we supposed to be brothers shouldn't be nothing more than a sibling rivalry! Much love UD ... Shaq let's end this it's been 50 years\"\n\nOn the same post, a user's comment implied that Howard was \"reaching out\" to the Big Aristotle. As a response to the comment, the two-time block champ uploaded another video of him revealing that has reached out to the TNT analyst on multiple occasions.\n\nCalling O'Neal \"capman\", Howard implied that the former was a liar for claiming that he had never reached out before. Revealing the apparent truth, the former Taoyuan Leopard player wanted to mend relationships with the Hall-Of-Famer.\n\n\"I reached out to Shaq myself on multiple occasions cause I'm like what's the issue? Like I understand the competitive side, but we don't even compete against each other... I have reached out to him and I would like for us to have some type of relationship. Life is too short,\" Dwight said.\n\nDwight Howard has expressed his desire to patch things up with Shaq on numerous occasions now. However, when he is asked about Howard, there always seems to be a bit of anger in 'The Diesel's voice.\n\nFans across the NBA community have been vocal about their desire for the two to bury the hatchet at some point. However, even with one side ready to break bread together, the situation still looks far from favorable.

She says that during her relationship with him, Shaq cheated with multiple women.\n\nMoniece alleges that Shaq cheated on her with multiple women during their four year-long relationship.

She said Shaq dumped her but did not know she was dumped until it all came out.\n\nSlaughter described the relationship as \"a mess.\" The host asked if Shaq was cheating on her, and she said, \"Yes, a lot.\" She then knew that she had gotten dumped when Rocsi Diaz popped up with Shaq on the internet. Moneice Slaughter says that in 2012, she got matching tattoos together with Shaq and planned to spend New Year's Eve together.

He was a superstar. And Shaq spoke about this some with JJ Reddick on the latest episode of The Big Podcast with Shaq.\n\nTheir conversation started with the typical 'Michael Jordan vs Lebron James' GOAT debate and Shaq says any argument about who the true NBA GOAT is also needs to include Kobe Bryan. He's absolutely correct about that. And while I'm tired of hearing 'GOAT' arguments for the past 10+ years and Jordan vs LeBron debates, I realized what I'm tired of is talking heads on TV debating, stans on Twitter arguing, and schmucks at the bar yammering on about who is better.\n\nShaq was there. He played against them all. His opinion actually matters. But then the conversation shifts and JJ Reddick asks Shaq what it was like to playing against Michael Jordan as a rookie. MJ has just back-to-back NBA Championships with the Bulls and was coming off a scoring title and regular season MVP in the 1991-92 season when Shaq entered the 1992-93 season. At the 4:40 mark in the video, Shaq says seeing Micahel Jordan on the court \"was like seeing god.\"\n\nShaquille O'Neal's full quote on seeing Michael Jordan on the court for the first time during Shaq's rookie season is:\n\n\"Man, I don't know what God looks like, but it's like seeing God. Because... I went to a couple NBA games as a youngster and I wasn't really impressed (with) San Antonio watching David Robinson. David Robinson impressed me a little bit but the stuff that he (Michael Jordan) did on TV and then you see it in real-life it was like 'oh my god, it's really real.'\"\n\n\"He came at me like one of the first plays of the game and in my mind I'm like 'I'm gonna get dunked on.' So I tried to beat him early (and) he slipped by me but I bumped him but he still laid it up on me and the crowd went crazy. But it also gave me confidence because he was killing us. But he came off a screen one time and he shot it and I didn't block it but I was there. I was like 'if I can get up early and maybe jump a little higher and go a little harder maybe I can get it.' In order to be the best you have to beat the best. I know I wasn't as good as him back then but jealousy motivates me.\"\n\nI think I got to see Shaq play one time for the Orlando Magic when I was kid. I believe it was his sophomore season and for the life of me I couldn't tell you who the Magic played, it was some sort of Boy Scouts trip I won for selling the most Boy Scouts popcorn in my troop but man, it was awesome. I went with my older brother and it was my first NBA game, that Shaq-Penny Hardaway duo was incredible. Truly the good ol' days for me. I loved hearing Shaq tell this story.\n\nSemi-related, Michael Jordan won a billfish tournament over the weekend in Abaco, The Bahamas after catching 5 white marlin, 4 blue marlin, and a sailfish.

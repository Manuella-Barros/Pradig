We have many options for Venezuela including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters in an impromptu question and answer session.\n\nThe comments appeared to shock Caracas, with Venezuela's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino calling the threat \"an act of craziness.\"\n\nThe White House said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro requested a phone call with Trump on Friday, which the White House appeared to spurn, saying in a statement that Trump would gladly speak to Venezuela's leader when democracy was restored in that country.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have long said U.S. officials were planning an invasion. A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said the U.S. military was ready to support efforts to protect U.S. citizens and America's national interests, but that insinuations by Caracas of a planned U.S. invasion were \"baseless.\"\n\nTrump's suggestion of possible military action came in a week when he has repeatedly threatened a military response if North Korea threatens the United States or its allies.\n\nAsked if U.S. forces would lead an operation in Venezuela, Trump declined to provide details. \"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,\" he said.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized Trump's new stance.\n\n\"Congress obviously isn't authorizing war in Venezuela,\" he said in a statement. \"Nicolas Maduro is a horrible human being, but Congress doesn't vote to spill Nebraskans' blood based on who the Executive lashes out at today.\"\n\nThe president's comments conjured up memories of gunboat diplomacy in Latin America during the 20th century, when the United States regarded its \"backyard\" neighbors to the south as underlings who it could easily intimidate through conspicuous displays of military power.\n\nThe U.S. military has not directly intervened in the region since a 1994-1995 operation that aimed to remove from Haiti a military government installed after a 1991 coup.\n\nTrump's more aggressive discourse could be an asset to Maduro by boosting his credibility as a national defender.\n\n\"Maduro must be thrilled right now,\" said Mark Feierstein, who was a senior aide on Venezuela matters to former U.S. president Barack Obama. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe United States sanctioned Maduro and other Venezuelan officials in July after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures. The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.\n\nNot surprisingly, this out of the blue announcement came as a surprise to Venezuela and prompted a predictable response:\n\nPresident Trump's remarks on Friday that he would not rule out a \"military option\" to quell the chaos in Venezuela set off a late-night diplomatic duel, with the defense minister accusing Mr. Trump of \"an act of madness\" and the White House saying it had turned away a call from Venezuela's president.\n\n\"It is an act of supreme extremism,\" Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez said late Friday in Caracas, the capital.\n\n\"As our minister of defense and a Venezuelan citizen,\" he added, \"I say it is an act of madness.\"\n\nAbout an hour later, the White House issued a statement saying that Mr. Trump had refused to take a phone call on Friday from Venezuela's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\n\"Today, Nicolas Maduro requested a phone call with President Donald J. Trump,\" the White House said. \"President Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nVenezuelan officials did not confirm the White House's account of the phone call. They seemed shocked that Mr. Trump had mentioned their country -- troubled for weeks by protests and charges of election fraud -- alongside a nuclear-armed North Korea.\n\nThe Venezuelan communications minister, Ernesto Villegas, in a television interview, called Mr. Trump's remark \"an unprecedented threat to national sovereignty.\"\n\nMr. Padrino did not indicate how Venezuela would officially respond to the comments by Mr. Trump, who said, \"Venezuela is not very far away, and the people are suffering, and they're dying.\"\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe defense minister said to expect a more detailed diplomatic response on Saturday.\n\nThe situation in Venezuela is one that has been getting seemingly worse as time has gone along. Thanks largely to the socialist policies put into effect by the late Hugo Chavez and continued by his successor, the country's economy is an absolute mess notwithstanding the fact that it continues to be sustained by revenues from the sale of oil, although the revenue it garners from natural resources has plummeted in recent years thanks to the sustained decline in oil prices that seems irreversible at the moment. Food shortages have become commonplace, for example, as have shortages of everyday item such as toilet paper and other basic needs. Additionally, President Nicholas Maduro has proven to be every bit as repressive to opposition parties as his predecessor and role model was if not more so. In recent months, this has led to marches in the streets and an increasingly vocal civilian opposition that is being met with violent repression by Venezuelan authorities. Recently, there have been events that have suggested that the Venezuelan military may be prepared to take matters into its own hands and overthrow the Maduro regime. This has included an incident in June involving a stolen police helicopter that attacked several government buildings in Caracas and elsewhere in the country, and what was described as a \"terrorist\" attack on a Venezuelan military base last week. Additionally, the aforementioned opposition protests have become increasingly violent, with police and military forces not holding back against people who are clearly frustrated with the extent more than a decade of rule under the Chavez/Maduro regime. At some point, the country seems likely to either descend into further chaos or overthrow Maduro and begin the process of recovering what should be a nation flourishing thanks to more than ample energy reserves.\n\nGiven that this is Trump we're talking about, it's hard to tell if his talk of a 'military option' is serious or not. This is, after all, a man with a long history of making boastful claims and threats that never come to pass, whether we're talking about his claims about the President's birth certificate or his promise to a rather idiotic promise to build a border wall that Mexico will pay for. Trump isn't making these statements as the D-List Celebrity he used to be, though, he's making them as President of the United States. This means that we are required to take what he says seriously, and the fact that he's saying something like this is rather alarming both because of the fact that he's threatening to get the U.S. military involved in what seems to be a situation that is headed down the road to civil war and because it is utterly without merit and wholly irresponsible.\n\nTo put it bluntly, there is nothing going on in Venezuela that would justify the use of American military force to intervene in the country. Thanks to years of economic and diplomatic sanctions there are apparently very few Americans even left in the country and those who are there are connected to the country's energy sector which, at least for now, has managed to escape any targeting by either the government or opposition forces. The Venezuelan military itself is far too small to pose a serious threat to the United States or any of its neighbors, and in any case is far too involved in trying to keep the increasingly discredited Maduro regime in power to be much of a problem for anyone else in the world. Trump's rhetoric, therefore, is nothing but blustering nonsense from a man who probably couldn't find Venezuela on a map if one of his advisers didn't point it out to him.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T14:50:00Z", "sim": 0.8117647171020508, "source": {"uri": "outsidethebeltway.com", "title": "outsidethebeltway.com", "id": "451"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:50:00", "url": "http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/trump-suggests-military-option-in-venezula/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8806334", "image": "http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Trump-Speech-Congress-570x428.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "14:50:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

McMaster to speak to members of the media following their meeting at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J., Friday. Pablo Martinez Monsivais -- The Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON >> President Donald Trump has said he wouldn't rule out military action against Venezuela in response to the country's descent into political chaos following President Nicolas Maduro's power grab. Venezuela's government responded by accusing Trump of seeking to destabilize Latin America.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, Trump bemoaned Venezuela's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table -- including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding, \"A military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nTrump's comment mark a serious escalation in rhetoric for the U.S., which has up until now stressed a regional approach that encourages Latin American allies to escalate pressure on the Maduro regime. Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region.\n\nVenezuela's government responded Saturday in a statement read by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza that called Trump's talk of a potential military option an act of belligerence and a threat to Latin America's stability.\n\nThe White House released a statement Friday evening saying it had rejected a request from Maduro to speak by phone with Trump. The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly expanded Panama Canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last weekend on MSNBC.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug off the accusations as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGoodman reported from Caracas, Venezuela. Associated Press writer Lolita C. Baldor in Washington contributed to this report.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T22:25:00Z", "sim": 0.8039215803146362, "source": {"uri": "news-herald.com", "title": "Willoughby News-Herald", "id": "3079"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "22:25:00", "url": "http://www.news-herald.com/article/HR/20170812/NEWS/170819829", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8850114", "image": "http://www.news-herald.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/HR/20170812/NEWS/170819829/AR/0/AR-170819829.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "22:25:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said the U.S. military was ready to support efforts to protect U.S. citizens and America's national interests, but that insinuations by Caracas of a planned U.S. invasion were \"baseless.\"\n\nTrump's suggestion of possible military action came in a week when he has repeatedly threatened a military response if North Korea threatens the United States or its allies.\n\nAsked if U.S. forces would lead an operation in Venezuela, Trump declined to provide details. \"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,\" he said.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized Trump's new stance.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters after meeting with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and National Security Adviser H.R.

The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.\n\nMaduro says only continuing the socialist movement started by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, can bring peace and prosperity to Venezuela, which is suffering from an economic collapse and widespread hunger.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters.

We have many options for Venezuela including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters in an impromptu question and answer session.\n\nThe comments appeared to shock Caracas, with Venezuela's Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino calling the threat \"an act of craziness.\"\n\nThe White House said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro requested a phone call with Trump on Friday, which the White House appeared to spurn, saying in a statement that Trump would gladly speak to Venezuela's leader when democracy was restored in that country.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have long said US officials were planning an invasion. A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said the US military was ready to support efforts to protect US citizens and America's national interests, but that insinuations by Caracas of a planned US invasion were \"baseless.\"\n\nTrump's suggestion of possible military action came in a week when he has repeatedly threatened a military response if North Korea threatens the United States or its allies.\n\nA Car is torched amid protests in Venezuela\n\nAsked if US forces would lead an operation in Venezuela, Trump declined to provide details. \"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,\" he said.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticised Trump's new stance.\n\n\"Congress obviously isn't authorising war in Venezuela,\" he said in a statement. \"Nicolas Maduro is a horrible human being, but Congress doesn't vote to spill Nebraskans' blood based on who the Executive lashes out at today.\"\n\n'MADURO MUST BE THRILLED'\n\nThe president's comments conjured up memories of gunboat diplomacy in Latin America during the 20th century, when the United States regarded its \"backyard\" neighbors to the south as underlings who it could easily intimidate through conspicuous displays of military power.\n\nThe U.S. military has not directly intervened in the region since a 1994-1995 operation that aimed to remove from Haiti a military government installed after a 1991 coup.\n\nTrump's more aggressive discourse could be an asset to Maduro by boosting his credibility as a national defender.\n\n\"Maduro must be thrilled right now,\" said Mark Feierstein, who was a senior aide on Venezuela matters to former U.S. president Barack Obama. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe United States sanctioned Maduro and other Venezuelan officials in July after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures. The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.\n\nMaduro says only continuing the socialist movement started by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, can bring peace and prosperity to Venezuela, which is suffering from an economic collapse and widespread hunger.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It has the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America, posing a concern for U.S. officials during the country's mounting turmoil.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the United States. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Washington was just trying to raise awareness of the situation and was not seeking any action by the 15-member Security Council.\n\nQuick Links Donald Trump", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T04:37:00Z", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.co.in", "title": "International Business Times, India Edition", "id": "317"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:37:00", "url": "http://www.ibtimes.co.in/donald-trump-threatens-venezuela-unspecified-military-option-738182", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8743876", "image": "http://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/656419/donald-trump-boot-4000-transgender-individuals-us-military.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "04:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Venezuela's government responded by accusing Trump of seeking to destabilize Latin America.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, Trump bemoaned Venezuela's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table - including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding, \"A military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nTrump's comment mark a serious escalation in rhetoric for the U.S., which has up until now stressed a regional approach that encourages Latin American allies to escalate pressure on the Maduro regime. Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region.\n\nVenezuela's government responded Saturday in a statement read by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza that called Trump's talk of a potential military option an act of belligerence and a threat to Latin America's stability.\n\nThe White House released a statement Friday evening saying it had rejected a request from Maduro to speak by phone with Trump. The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela - the third-largest supplier to the U.S. - would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly expanded Panama Canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last weekend on MSNBC.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug off the accusations as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n__\n\nGoodman reported from Caracas, Venezuela. Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Venezuela's government responded by accusing Trump of seeking to destabilize Latin America.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, Trump bemoaned Venezuela's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table -- including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding, \"A military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nTrump's comment mark a serious escalation in rhetoric for the U.S., which has up until now stressed a regional approach that encourages Latin American allies to escalate pressure on the Maduro regime. Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region.\n\nVenezuela's government responded Saturday in a statement read by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza that called Trump's talk of a potential military option an act of belligerence and a threat to Latin America's stability.\n\nThe White House released a statement Friday evening saying it had rejected a request from Maduro to speak by phone with Trump. The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly expanded Panama Canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last weekend on MSNBC.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug off the accusations as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T03:39:00Z", "sim": 0.7882353067398071, "source": {"uri": "hamodia.com", "title": "Hamodia", "id": "3374"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:39:00", "url": "http://hamodia.com/2017/08/12/trump-says-hes-open-military-intervention-venezuela/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8868374", "image": "http://images.hamodia.com/hamod-uploads/2017/08/AP17223820458270-300x233.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "03:39:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Venezuela's government responded by accusing Trump of seeking to destabilize Latin America.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, Trump bemoaned Venezuela's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table -- including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding, \"A military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nTrump's comment mark a serious escalation in rhetoric for the U.S., which has up until now stressed a regional approach that encourages Latin American allies to escalate pressure on the Maduro regime. Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice-President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region.\n\nVenezuela's government responded Saturday in a statement read by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza that called Trump's talk of a potential military option an act of belligerence and a threat to Latin America's stability.\n\nThe White House released a statement Friday evening saying it had rejected a request from Maduro to speak by phone with Trump. The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly expanded Panama Canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbours to speak with a single voice in defence of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last weekend on MSNBC.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug off the accusations as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defence Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n__\n\nGoodman reported from Caracas, Venezuela. Associated Press writer Lolita C.

A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said the U.S. military was ready to support efforts to protect U.S. citizens and America's national interests, but that insinuations by Caracas of a planned U.S. invasion were \"baseless.\"\n\nTrump's suggestion of possible military action came in a week when he has repeatedly threatened a military response if North Korea threatens the United States or its allies.\n\nAsked if U.S. forces would lead an operation in Venezuela, Trump declined to provide details. \"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,\" he said.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized Trump's military stance.\n\n\"Congress obviously isn't authorizing war in Venezuela,\" he said in a statement. \"Nicolas Maduro is a horrible human being, but Congress doesn't vote to spill Nebraskans' blood based on who the Executive lashes out at today.\"\n\nThe president's comments conjured up memories of gunboat diplomacy in Latin America during the 20th century, when the United States regarded its \"backyard\" southern neighbors as underlings who could easily be intimidated through conspicuous displays of military power.\n\nThe U.S. military has not directly intervened in the region since a 1994-1995 operation that aimed to remove a military government from Haiti installed after a 1991 coup.\n\nTrump's more aggressive discourse could be an asset to Maduro by boosting his credibility as a national defender.\n\n\"Maduro must be thrilled right now,\" said Mark Feierstein, who was a senior aide on Venezuela matters to former U.S. president Barack Obama. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe United States sanctioned Maduro and other Venezuelan officials in July after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures. The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.\n\nMaduro says only continuing the socialist movement started by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, can bring peace and prosperity to Venezuela, which is suffering from an economic collapse and widespread hunger.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It has the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America, posing a concern for U.S. officials during the country's mounting turmoil.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the United States.

Donald Trump, flanked by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (L) and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley (R) speaks to reporters after their meeting at Trump's golf estate in Bedminster, New Jersey U.S. August 11, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst US President Donald Trump says he wasn't being serious in remarks about PutinDonald Trump says U.S. is 'locked and loaded' in North Korea confrontationNorth Korea threat: 'Take cover, avoid bomb flash'- Guam issues nuclear guidelines\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened military intervention in Venezuela, a surprise escalation of Washington's response to Venezuela's political crisis that Caracas disparaged as \"craziness.\" Venezuela has appeared to slide toward a more volatile stage of unrest in recent days, with anti-government forces looting weapons from a military base after a new legislative body usurped the authority of the opposition-controlled congress.\n\n\"The people are suffering and they are dying. We have many options for Venezuela including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters in an impromptu question and answer session.\n\nThe comments appeared to shock Caracas, with Venezuela's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino calling the threat \"an act of craziness.\"\n\nThe White House said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro requested a phone call with Trump on Friday, which the White House appeared to spurn, saying in a statement that Trump would gladly speak to Venezuela's leader when democracy was restored in that country.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have long said U.S. officials were planning an invasion. A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said the U.S. military was ready to support efforts to protect U.S. citizens and America's national interests, but that insinuations by Caracas of a planned U.S. invasion were \"baseless.\"\n\nTrump's suggestion of possible military action came in a week when he has repeatedly threatened a military response if North Korea threatens the United States or its allies.\n\nAsked if U.S. forces would lead an operation in Venezuela, Trump declined to provide details. \"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,\" he said.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized Trump's new stance.\n\n\"Congress obviously isn't authorizing war in Venezuela,\" he said in a statement. \"Nicolas Maduro is a horrible human being, but Congress doesn't vote to spill Nebraskans' blood based on who the Executive lashes out at today.\"\n\n'MADURO MUST BE THRILLED'\n\nThe president's comments conjured up memories of gunboat diplomacy in Latin America during the 20th century, when the United States regarded its \"backyard\" neighbors to the south as underlings who it could easily intimidate through conspicuous displays of military power.\n\nThe U.S. military has not directly intervened in the region since a 1994-1995 operation that aimed to remove from Haiti a military government installed after a 1991 coup.\n\nTrump's more aggressive discourse could be an asset to Maduro by boosting his credibility as a national defender.\n\n\"Maduro must be thrilled right now,\" said Mark Feierstein, who was a senior aide on Venezuela matters to former U.S. president Barack Obama. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe United States sanctioned Maduro and other Venezuelan officials in July after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures. The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.\n\nMaduro says only continuing the socialist movement started by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, can bring peace and prosperity to Venezuela, which is suffering from an economic collapse and widespread hunger.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It has the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America, posing a concern for U.S. officials during the country's mounting turmoil.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the United States. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Washington was just trying to raise awareness of the situation and was not seeking any action by the 15-member Security Council.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: donald trump", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 51, "textStart": 36}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 304, "textStart": 289}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:50:00Z", "sim": 0.7882353067398071, "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "title": "The Indian Express", "id": "1155"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:50:00", "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-president-donald-trump-threatens-venezuela-with-unspecified-military-option-4792974/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8735370", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/donald-trump-7591.jpg?w=759", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:50:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

After the vote on July 30, the US sanctioned Maduro himself, and this week the US Treasury announced sanctions against eight more officials.\n\nVenezuela is now in the fifth month of a period of protests that broke out in early April, after the supreme court, considered by many to aligned with Maduro, attempted to strip the opposition-led National Assembly of its powers.\n\nThe supreme court backed off that effort, but the often violent protests that have taken place since have left at least 120 people dead, the majority of them anti-government demonstrators, and led to thousands of arrests.\n\nThis week, 17 countries from the region condemned the \"breakdown of democratic order\" in Venezuela and said they would not recognize the constituent assembly or any measures it may pass regarding future joint oil ventures or debt matters.\n\n(A demonstrator is detained at a rally during a strike called to protest against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas.Thomson Reuters)\n\nTrump administration officials have previously said all options are on the table\" to penalize Maduro and his government, including import or export bans on Venezuelan oil or sanctions on the state-run oil company, Pdvsa.\n\nA number of experts as well as US businesses have urged caution with sanctions on the oil industry.

Venezuela's government responded by accusing Trump of seeking to destabilize Latin America.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, Trump bemoaned Venezuela's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table -- including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding, \"A military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nTrump's comment mark a serious escalation in rhetoric for the U.S., which has up until now stressed a regional approach that encourages Latin American allies to escalate pressure on the Maduro regime. Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region.\n\nVenezuela's government responded Saturday in a statement read by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza that called Trump's talk of a potential military option an act of belligerence and a threat to Latin America's stability.\n\nThe White House released a statement Friday evening saying it had rejected a request from Maduro to speak by phone with Trump. The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly expanded Panama Canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last weekend on MSNBC.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug off the accusations as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader.

The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.\n\nMaduro says only continuing the socialist movement started by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, can bring peace and prosperity to Venezuela, which is suffering from an economic collapse and widespread hunger.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It has the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America, posing a concern for U.S. officials during the country's mounting turmoil.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the United States. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Washington was just trying to raise awareness of the situation and was not seeking any action by the 15-member Security Council. ik/10:50\n\n###\n\nAll Rights Reserved.This material may not be stored, published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed in any form, except with the prior express permission of Macedonian Information Agency.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 26, "textStart": 12}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T08:55:00Z", "sim": 0.7764706015586853, "source": {"uri": "mia.mk", "title": "MIA", "id": "18788"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:55:00", "url": "http://www.mia.mk/en/Inside/RenderSingleNews/314/133813424", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8767755", "image": "http://www.mia.mk/File/Picture/133270298/picture.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "08:55:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela - the third-largest supplier to the U.S. - would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly expanded Panama Canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbours to speak with a single voice in defence of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders.

A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said the US military was ready to support efforts to protect US citizens and America's national interests, but that insinuations by Caracas of a planned US invasion were \"baseless\".\n\nTrump's suggestion of possible military action came in a week when he has repeatedly threatened a military response if North Korea threatens the United States or its allies.\n\nAsked if US forces would lead an operation in Venezuela, Trump declined to provide details. \"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,\" he said.\n\n'MADURO MUST BE THRILLED'\n\nThe President's comments conjured up memories of gunboat diplomacy in Latin America during the 20th century, when the US regarded its \"backyard\" neighbours to the south as underlings who it could easily intimidate through conspicuous displays of military power.\n\nThe US military has not directly intervened in the region since a 1994-1995 operation that aimed to remove from Haiti a military government installed after a 1991 coup.\n\nTrump's more aggressive discourse could be an asset to Maduro by boosting his credibility as a national defender.\n\n\"Maduro must be thrilled right now,\" said Mark Feierstein, who was a senior aide on Venezuela matters to former US president Barack Obama. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe US sanctioned Maduro and other Venezuelan officials in July after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures. The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.\n\nMaduro says only continuing the socialist movement started by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, can bring peace and prosperity to Venezuela, which is suffering from an economic collapse and widespread hunger.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the Opec member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made Manpads surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It has the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America, posing a concern for US officials during the country's mounting turmoil.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the US.

Venezuela's government responded by accusing Trump of seeking to destabilize Latin America.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, Trump bemoaned Venezuela's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table - including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding, \"A military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nTrump's comment mark a serious escalation in rhetoric for the U.S., which has up until now stressed a regional approach that encourages Latin American allies to escalate pressure on the Maduro regime. Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice-President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region.\n\nVenezuela's government responded Saturday in a statement read by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza that called Trump's talk of a potential military option an act of belligerence and a threat to Latin America's stability.\n\nThe White House released a statement Friday evening saying it had rejected a request from Maduro to speak by phone with Trump. The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela - the third-largest supplier to the U.S. - would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly expanded Panama Canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbours to speak with a single voice in defence of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last weekend on MSNBC.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug off the accusations as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defence Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n__\n\nGoodman reported from Caracas, Venezuela. Associated Press writer Lolita C.

A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said the U.S. military was ready to support efforts to protect U.S. citizens and America's national interests, but that insinuations by Caracas of a planned U.S. invasion were \"baseless.\"\n\nTrump's suggestion of possible military action came in a week when he has repeatedly threatened a military response if North Korea threatens the United States or its allies.\n\nAsked if U.S. forces would lead an operation in Venezuela, Trump declined to provide details. \"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,\" he said.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized Trump's new stance.\n\n\"Congress obviously isn't authorizing war in Venezuela,\" he said in a statement. \"Nicolas Maduro is a horrible human being, but Congress doesn't vote to spill Nebraskans' blood based on who the Executive lashes out at today.\"\n\n'MADURO MUST BE THRILLED'\n\nThe president's comments conjured up memories of gunboat diplomacy in Latin America during the 20th century, when the United States regarded its \"backyard\" neighbours to the south as underlings who it could easily intimidate through conspicuous displays of military power.\n\nThe U.S. military has not directly intervened in the region since a 1994-1995 operation that aimed to remove from Haiti a military government installed after a 1991 coup.\n\nTrump's more aggressive discourse could be an asset to Maduro by boosting his credibility as a national defender.\n\n\"Maduro must be thrilled right now,\" said Mark Feierstein, who was a senior aide on Venezuela matters to former U.S. president Barack Obama. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe United States sanctioned Maduro and other Venezuelan officials in July after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures. The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.\n\nMaduro says only continuing the socialist movement started by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, can bring peace and prosperity to Venezuela, which is suffering from an economic collapse and widespread hunger.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It has the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America, posing a concern for U.S. officials during the country's mounting turmoil.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the United States. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Washington was just trying to raise awareness of the situation and was not seeking any action by the 15-member Security Council.\n\n(Reporting by James Oliphant; Additional reporting by Hugh Bronstein and Girish Gupta in Caracas; Writing by Jason Lange in Washington; Editing by Andrew Hay and Mary Milliken)", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:37:00Z", "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "title": "The Star Online", "id": "334"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:37:00", "url": "http://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2017/08/12/trump-threatens-venezuela-with-military-option/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8734427", "image": "http://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/online/2017/08/12/00/16/20170812t001506z_1_lynxmped7b005_rtroptp_3_usatrump.ashx/", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Venezuela's government responded by accusing Trump of seeking to destabilize Latin America.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, Trump bemoaned Venezuela's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table - including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding, \"A military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nTrump's comment mark a serious escalation in rhetoric for the U.S., which has up until now stressed a regional approach that encourages Latin American allies to escalate pressure on the Maduro regime. Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region.\n\nVenezuela's government responded Saturday in a statement read by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza that called Trump's talk of a potential military option an act of belligerence and a threat to Latin America's stability.\n\nThe White House released a statement Friday evening saying it had rejected a request from Maduro to speak by phone with Trump. The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela - the third-largest supplier to the U.S. - would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly expanded Panama Canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last weekend on MSNBC.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug off the accusations as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T17:59:00Z", "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "title": "Spokesman.com", "id": "2267"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "17:59:00", "url": "http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2017/aug/12/trump-says-hes-open-to-military-intervention-in-ve/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8826197", "image": "https://media.spokesman.com/img/logos/sr200-tower.png", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "17:59:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela - the third-largest supplier to the U.S. - would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nIn eastern Caracas, the center of months of deadly anti-government protests, residents reacted with a mix of disbelief and frustration with Trump's remarks, which they fear will embolden the weakened Maduro and distract attention from his abuses.\n\n\"Of course we don't support violence, but look at all the violence we're already suffering,\" said Irali Medina, an office administrator, pointing to the spot where a university student was killed recently by a tear gas canister fired by national guardsmen controlling protesters.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n__\n\nGoodman reported from Caracas, Venezuela. Associated Press writer Lolita C.

REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino By James Oliphant, Reuters Aug 11, 2017 at 10:03 pm | Print View\n\nBEDMINSTER, N.J., -- U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened military intervention in Venezuela, a surprise escalation of Washington's response to Venezuela's political crisis that Caracas disparaged as \"craziness.\"\n\nVenezuela has appeared to slide toward a more volatile stage of unrest in recent days, with anti-government forces looting weapons from a military base after a new legislative body usurped the authority of the opposition-controlled congress.\n\n\"The people are suffering and they are dying. We have many options for Venezuela including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters in an impromptu question and answer session.\n\nThe comments appeared to shock Caracas, with Venezuela's Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino calling the threat \"an act of craziness.\"\n\nThe White House said Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro requested a phone call with Trump on Friday, which the White House appeared to spurn, saying in a statement that Trump would gladly speak to Venezuela's leader when democracy was restored in that country.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have long said U.S. officials were planning an invasion. A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said the U.S. military was ready to support efforts to protect U.S. citizens and America's national interests, but that insinuations by Caracas of a planned U.S. invasion were \"baseless.\"\n\nTrump's suggestion of possible military action came in a week when he has repeatedly threatened a military response if North Korea threatens the United States or its allies.\n\nAsked if U.S. forces would lead an operation in Venezuela, Trump declined to provide details. \"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,\" he said.\n\nSenator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized Trump's new stance.\n\n\"Congress obviously isn't authorizing war in Venezuela,\" he said in a statement. \"Nicolas Maduro is a horrible human being, but Congress doesn't vote to spill Nebraskans' blood based on who the Executive lashes out at today.\"\n\n'MADURO MUST BE THRILLED'\n\nThe president's comments conjured up memories of gunboat diplomacy in Latin America during the 20th century, when the United States regarded its \"backyard\" neighbors to the south as underlings who it could easily intimidate through conspicuous displays of military power.\n\nThe U.S. military has not directly intervened in the region since a 1994-1995 operation that aimed to remove from Haiti a military government installed after a 1991 coup.\n\nTrump's more aggressive discourse could be an asset to Maduro by boosting his credibility as a national defender.\n\n\"Maduro must be thrilled right now,\" said Mark Feierstein, who was a senior aide on Venezuela matters to former U.S. president Barack Obama. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe United States sanctioned Maduro and other Venezuelan officials in July after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures. The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.\n\nMaduro says only continuing the socialist movement started by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, can bring peace and prosperity to Venezuela, which is suffering from an economic collapse and widespread hunger.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It has the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America, posing a concern for U.S. officials during the country's mounting turmoil.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the United States. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Washington was just trying to raise awareness of the situation and was not seeking any action by the 15-member Security Council.

Venezuela has in turn accused America of \"imperialist aggression.\"\n\nBut Friday's latest comments were the first sign that Trump may be mulling military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters in New Jersey. \"We have troops all over the world in places that are very far away. Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and they're dying.\"\n\nTrump said Venezuela's political crisis was among the topics discussed at the talks he hosted in New Jersey on Friday with secretary of state Rex Tillerson and UN ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"Venezuela is a mess. It is very dangerous mess and a very sad situation,\" Trump said.\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, said Trump will agree to speak to Venezuela's leader \"as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\" It said Maduro requested on Friday a phone call with Trump.\n\n\"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela in the face of their continued repression by the Maduro regime. President Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nIf any US military contingency planning is under way, it must be in its early stages. A spokesman for the department of defense, Eric Pahon, refused to elaborate on Trump's comments, adding: \"As of right now, the Pentagon has received no orders.\"\n\nAnd the military command responsible for US operations in Latin America, Southern Command, said: \"The military conducts contingency planning for a variety of situations.\n\n\"If called upon, we are prepared to support whole-of-government efforts to protect our national interest and safeguard US citizens. US Southern Command has not received an order.\"\n\nQuash dissent\n\nTrump's warning came two days after his administration imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, targeting members of a loyalist assembly installed last week to bolster what Washington calls Maduro's \"dictatorship\".\n\nThe Venezuelan government responded to the sanctions -- which already targeted Maduro himself -- by saying the US was \"making a fool of itself in front of the world.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Maduro declared that Venezuela's new Constituent Assembly holds supreme power over all branches of government, even over his position, and that its work -- ostensibly to rewrite the constitution -- would return \"peace\" to the country.\n\nBut the United States and major Latin American nations allege that Maduro is using the body as a tool to quash dissent, by clamping down on the opposition and the legislature it controls.\n\nThe crisis has fuelled the street demonstrations that have gripped Venezuela for the past four months. Nearly 130 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\nThe protests have lost steam in the past week as security forces have stepped up repression and demonstrators have grown discouraged by the opposition's failure to bring about change.\n\nBut hackers have taken up the torch. On Thursday a group calling itself The Binary Guardians claimed responsibility for a massive cyberattack that cut mobile telephone service to seven million users.\n\nOpposition to Maduro among the oil-exporting country's 30 million citizens increased during a long economic crisis that brought food shortages and hyperinflation to what was once of Latin America's wealthiest countries.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:56:00Z", "sim": 0.7607843279838562, "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "title": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/", "id": "294"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:56:00", "url": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-mulls-military-option-on-venezuela-to-speak-to-maduro-when-democracy-restored/story-5Gg3UK4lvJeUtYXpDmy3PJ.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8735667", "image": "http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/08/12/Pictures/topshot-venezuela-crisis-maduro-constituent-assemby_9b324256-7f04-11e7-b5e3-d817f67cfdf5.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:56:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

At the time, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Washington was just trying to raise awareness of the situation and was not seeking any action by the 15-member Security Council.\n\n(Reporting by James Oliphant; Additional reporting by Hugh Bronstein and Girish Gupta in Caracas; Writing by Jason Lange in Washington; Editing by Andrew Hay and Mary Milliken)", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T13:23:00Z", "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "source": {"uri": "huffingtonpost.ca", "title": "The Huffington Post Canada", "id": "355"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "14:09:00", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/08/12/donald-trump-hints-at-military-option-for-venezuela_a_23075497/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8802852", "image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/3500x1842+0+257/resize/1200x630!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fe3ac8fd19956b99814325fa3cb55b5ff%2F205561526%2FRTS1BFMR.jpeg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "13:23:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.\n\nMaduro says only continuing the socialist movement started by his predecessor, Hugo Chavez, can bring peace and prosperity to Venezuela, which is suffering from an economic collapse and widespread hunger.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters.

A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said the U.S. military was ready to support efforts to protect U.S. citizens and America's national interests, but that insinuations by Caracas of a planned U.S. invasion were \"baseless.\"\n\nTrump's suggestion of possible military action came in a week when he has repeatedly threatened a military response if North Korea threatens the United States or its allies.\n\nAsked if U.S. forces would lead an operation in Venezuela, Trump declined to provide details. \"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,\" he said.\n\n\"MADURO MUST BE THRILLED\"\n\nThe president's comments conjured up memories of gunboat diplomacy in Latin America during the 20th century, when the United States regarded its \"backyard\" neighbours to the south as underlings who it could easily intimidate through conspicuous displays of military power.\n\nThe U.S. military has not directly intervened in the region since a 1994-1995 operation that aimed to remove from Haiti a military government installed after a 1991 coup.\n\nTrump's comments could be an asset to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by boosting his credibility as a national defender.\n\n\"Maduro must be thrilled right now,\" said Mark Feierstein, who was a senior aide on Venezuela matters to former U.S. president Barack Obama. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe United States sanctioned Maduro and other Venezuelan officials in July after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures. The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It has the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America, posing a concern for U.S. officials during the country's mounting turmoil.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the United States. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Washington was just trying to raise awareness of the situation and was not seeking any action by the 15-member Security Council.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:24:00Z", "sim": 0.7490196228027344, "source": {"uri": "dnaindia.com", "title": "Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India", "id": "492"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:24:00", "url": "http://www.dnaindia.com/world/report-trump-threatens-venezuela-with-unspecified-military-option-2527510", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8724233", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:24:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region.\n\nVenezuela's government responded Saturday in a statement read by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza that called Trump's talk of a potential military option an act of belligerence and a threat to Latin America's stability.\n\nThe White House released a statement Friday evening saying it had rejected a request from Maduro to speak by phone with Trump. The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly expanded Panama Canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last weekend on MSNBC.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug off the accusations as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader.

Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region later this week.\n\nVenezuela's defense minister called Trump's talk of a military intervention an act of \"craziness\" and \"supreme extremism.\"\n\nGen. Vladimir Padrino, a close ally of Maduro, said, \"With this extremist elite that's in charge in the U.S., who knows what will happen to the world?\"\n\nThe White House later released a statement saying it had rejected a request from Maduro to speak by phone with Trump. The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela - the third-largest supplier to the U.S. - would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nIn eastern Caracas, the center of months of deadly anti-government protests, residents reacted with a mix of disbelief and frustration with Trump's remarks, which they fear will embolden the weakened Maduro and distract attention from his abuses.\n\n\"Of course we don't support violence, but look at all the violence we're already suffering,\" said Irali Medina, an office administrator, pointing to the spot where a university student was killed recently by a tear gas canister fired by national guardsmen controlling protesters.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela.

Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and they're dying.\"\n\nTrump said Venezuela's political crisis was among the topics discussed at the talks he hosted at his golf club in New Jersey with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"Venezuela is a mess. It is very dangerous mess and a very sad situation,\" Trump said.\n\nBut if any US military contingency planning is under way, it must be in its early stages.

Nearly 130 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\nThe protests have lost steam in the past week as security forces have stepped up repression and demonstrators have grown discouraged by the opposition's failure to bring about change. -- AFP", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T19:37:00Z", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "title": "Saudi Gazette", "id": "5204"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:28:00", "url": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/article/514969/World/America/Donald-Trump", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8867293", "image": "http://saudigazette.com.sa/uploads/images/2017/08/12/462319.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "19:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Venezuela's government responded by accusing Trump of seeking to destabilize Latin America.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his Bedminster, N.J., golf club, Trump bemoaned Venezuela's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table -- including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" he said, adding, \"A military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nTrump's comment marked a serious escalation in rhetoric for the U.S., which has up until now stressed a regional approach that encourages Latin American allies to escalate pressure on the Maduro regime. Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region.\n\nVenezuela's government responded Saturday in a statement read by Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza that called Trump's talk of a potential military option an act of belligerence and a threat to Latin America's stability.\n\nThe White House released a statement Friday evening saying it had rejected a request from Maduro to speak by phone with Trump. The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe administration has slapped sanctions on Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly expanded Panama Canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T22:20:00Z", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "title": "Star Tribune", "id": "157"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "22:20:00", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/venezuela-calls-trump-s-tough-talk-an-act-of-belligerance/440073113/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8849788", "image": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1502307346", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "22:20:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

On Friday, US President #Donald Trump threatened that his country could intervene militarily in Venezuela, in an unexpected escalation of the United State's response to the political climate in Caracas.\n\nThe political crisis in Venezuela appears to grow more volatile. Forces opposed to the rule of Nicolas Maduro have even looted weapons from a military base. The protests were sparked by President Maduro's decision to institute a new legislative assembly, usurping the powers of the country's Congress, which is controlled by the opposition.\n\nSpeaking to Journalists during an impromptu question and answer press conference, President Trump said that the people of Venezuela are suffering, and some are dying. Trump added that Washington is considering several options to intervene in Venezuela, one of them being military action should its need arise. Trump's comments have sent shockwaves in Venezuela, with Vladimir Paduro, the country's Defense Minister terming them as an act of craziness.\n\n#the white house said that on Friday Nicolas Maduro requested to hold a phone conversation with President Trump. However, his request seems to have been ignored, with the White House stating that Trump would only consider talking to Maduro once democracy is restored in Venezuela.\n\nMaduro and his loyalists have long claimed that the United States is planning to invade the Socialist state.\n\nEarlier this years, a former Venezuelan military official told Reuters that anti-aircraft missiles had been installed along the country's coast, in preparation for the expected US invasion.\n\nThe Pentagon has said that #The United States military is prepared to support efforts to secure US citizens and other American interests in Venezuela. However, US military officials have denied accusations that they are planning an invasion.\n\nHowever, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska has criticized Trump's threat to Venezuela. Senator Sasse, a member of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, said that Congress does not plan to authorize a US-led war in Venezuela.\n\nSome experts say that Trump's aggressive comments could work in Maduro's favor, helping the leader to boost his standing as Venezuela's defender.\n\nPresident Trump's threats to Nicolas Maduro came in a week where the Republican has warned North Korea of decisive action should Kim Jong-un's government threaten Washington or its allies.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T10:38:00Z", "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "source": {"uri": "us.blastingnews.com", "title": "Blasting News", "id": "6890"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:29:00", "url": "http://us.blastingnews.com/world/2017/08/donald-trump-threatens-military-intervention-in-venezuela-001926387.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8867350", "image": "http://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/12/660x290/b_1433x630/us-president-donald-trumphttpswwwflickrcomphotosgageskidmore8567825104_1504563.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "10:38:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

"TEHRAN (FNA)- US Vice President Mike Pence will visit Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama amid escalating tensions with neighboring Venezuela and North Korea.\n\nPence is set to meet with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos on Sunday at the start of a weeklong trip to Latin America that is likely to be dominated by conversations about the deepening crisis in Venezuela, AP reported.\n\nPence's trip will also take him to Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City, Panama, where he is expected to deliver a number of speeches, meet with the country's leaders and tour the newly expanded Panama Canal.\n\nSeveral Latin American nations came out strongly against US President Donald Trump's threat of military intervention to solve the ongoing political crisis in Venezuela.\n\nSouth American trade bloc Mercosur rejects the use of force in Venezuela, a day after US President Donald Trump threatened military intervention.\n\nIn a statement, the South American trade bloc Mercosur rejected US President's suggestion that a \"military option\" was possible to solve the ongoing domestic political crisis in Venezuela, saying that, \"The only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialog and diplomacy.\"\n\nThe bloc, which consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, added that \"the repudiation of violence and any option that implies the use of force is inalienable and constitutes the fundamental basis for democratic coexistence.\"\n\nOther South American countries, such as Peru, Mexico, and Colombia, also joined the chorus of Latin American unity against the US with statements of their own, criticizing Washington's threat of military action against Caracas as a move against the United Nations' principles.\n\nThe US President has announced that Washington could take military action against Venezuela and President Nicolas Maduro's power grab.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary,\" Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf club on Friday.\n\nThe president did not answer a question about whether American troops would lead a potential operation, while he added that \"we don't talk about it. But a military operation, a military option, is certainly something we could pursue.\"\n\nVenezuela's Defense Minister denounced Trump's \"crazy\" threat of military action amid escalating bilateral tensions over what Caracas views as Washington's meddling in the Latin American country's political crisis.\n\n\"This is an act of craziness, an act of supreme extremism,\" General Vladimir Padrino said in an interview with the state television on Friday.\n\n\"As a soldier, together with the FANB (Venezuela's armed forces) and together with the people, I am certain that we will all be in the first ranks defending the interests and sovereignty of our beloved Venezuela,\" the defense chief added.\n\n\"There is an extremist elite governing the United States and honestly I don't know what's happening, what is going to happen in the world,\" Padrino stressed.\n\nThe Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said threats of a military operation against Venezuela are an attempt by US President Donald Trump to drag Latin America into a conflict and destabilize the continent.\n\n\"Venezuela rejects in the most categorical and convincing manner the unfriendly and hostile statements by US President Donald Trump... in which he threatens a military invasion against our homeland,\" Arreaza told broadcaster Venezuelana de Televisi\u00f3n.\n\nAccording to the minister, Trump's real aim is not Venezuela, but the whole Latin American continent, which he wants to see in turmoil.\n\n\"The reckless threats of President Donald Trump are designed to draw Latin America and the Caribbean into a conflict that will irrevocably violate stability, peace and security in our region,\" he added.\n\nArreaza had also rejected the threat as \"hostile,\" and called on Latin America to unite against Washington.\n\n\"The reckless threat by President Trump aims to drag Latin America and the Caribbean into a conflict that would permanently alter stability, peace, and security in our region,\" he stressed.\n\nVenezuela has been reeling from unrest for several months in a crisis caused by political disagreements -- including on the formation of the National Constituent Assembly -- and shortages of food and medicine and hyperinflation.\n\nPolitical tensions in Venezuela rose recently after Caracas announced plans to establish a Constituent Assembly to take over the opposition-controlled parliament and rewrite the constitution. The opposition saw the move as an overt attempt by President Maduro to accumulate power.\n\nThe Venezuelan government held an election on July 30 and the ruling socialist party won the vote. The political tensions there have seen a rise after Venezuelan people said 'Yes' in an election last week to the formation of a national assembly tasked with dissolving the opposition-led congress and rewrite the constitution, while the vote was boycotted by the opposition.\n\nProtests erupted on the streets, and clashes led to the death of at least 120 people from the two sides.\n\nThe day after election, the US slapped sanctions on Maduro and broadened the sanctions later this week by imposing bans against several members of the assembly. The United States imposed sanctions against 13 current and former Venezuelan officials after doing the same to the country's vice president in February. The US Treasury Department later froze Maduro's US assets and called him a \"dictator\" for pushing ahead with the election.\n\nTrump said in mid-July that Maduro \"dreams of becoming a dictator,\" noting that \"the United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\"\n\nMeantime, Maduro vowed to stand up to the US for its \"imperialistic\" behavior.\n\n\"We will never cede to foreign powers,\" he said in a speech at the assembly and added that Trump had to end his \"imperialist aggression\" toward Venezuela.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 4690, "textStart": 4683}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T11:39:00Z", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "source": {"uri": "en.farsnews.com", "title": "en.farsnews.com", "id": "36"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "11:39:00", "url": "http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13960522000957", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8909337", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "11:39:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

We have many options for Venezuela including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nMore than 120 people have been killed in Venezuela and thousands arrested in over four months of unrest. The government in Caracas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's threat.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have long said U.S. officials were planning an invasion. A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said it had not received any orders on Venezuela from the White House. Trump, asked if U.S. forces would lead any operation in Venezuela, declined to provide details.\n\n\"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,\" Trump said.\n\nThe United States sanctioned Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan officials on July 31 after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It is the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America and a source of concern for U.S. officials amid the country's mounting turmoil.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the United States. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Washington was just trying to raise awareness of the situation and was not seeking any action by the 15-member Security Council.

Nearly 130 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\nThe protests have lost steam in the past week as security forces have stepped up repression and demonstrators have grown discouraged by the opposition's failure to bring about change.\n\nHowever, hackers have taken up the torch.

On Friday, US President #Donald Trump threatened that his country could intervene militarily in Venezuela, in an unexpected escalation of the United State's response to the political climate in Caracas.\n\nThe political crisis in Venezuela appears to grow more volatile. Forces opposed to the rule of Nicolas Maduro have even looted weapons from a military base. The protests were sparked by President Maduro's decision to institute a new legislative assembly, usurping the powers of the country's Congress, which is controlled by the opposition.\n\nSpeaking to Journalists during an impromptu question and answer press conference, President Trump said that the people of Venezuela are suffering, and some are dying. Trump added that Washington is considering several options to intervene in Venezuela, one of them being military action should its need arise. Trump's comments have sent shockwaves in Venezuela, with Vladimir Paduro, the country's Defense Minister terming them as an act of craziness.\n\n#the white house said that on Friday Nicolas Maduro requested to hold a phone conversation with President Trump. However, his request seems to have been ignored, with the White House stating that Trump would only consider talking to Maduro once democracy is restored in Venezuela.\n\nMaduro and his loyalists have long claimed that the United States is planning to invade the Socialist state.\n\nEarlier this years, a former Venezuelan military official told Reuters that anti-aircraft missiles had been installed along the country's coast, in preparation for the expected US invasion.\n\nThe Pentagon has said that #The United States military is prepared to support efforts to secure US citizens and other American interests in Venezuela. However, US military officials have denied accusations that they are planning an invasion.\n\nHowever, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska has criticized Trump's threat to Venezuela. Senator Sasse, a member of the US Senate Armed Services Committee, said that Congress does not plan to authorize a US-led war in Venezuela.\n\nSome experts say that Trump's aggressive comments could work in Maduro's favor, helping the leader to boost his standing as Venezuela's defender.\n\nPresident Trump's threats to Nicolas Maduro came in a week where the Republican has warned North Korea of decisive action should Kim Jong-un's government threaten Washington or its allies.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T23:10:00Z", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "source": {"uri": "gearsofbiz.com", "title": "gearsofbiz.com", "id": "19218"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:54:00", "url": "http://gearsofbiz.com/donald-trump-threatens-military-intervention-in-venezuela/7621", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8892903", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "23:10:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Venezuela's defense minister called Trump's talk of a military intervention an act of \"craziness\" and \"supreme extremism.\"\n\nGen. Vladimir Padrino, a close ally of Maduro, said, \"With this extremist elite that's in charge in the U.S., who knows what will happen to the world?\"\n\nThe White House later released a statement saying it had rejected a request from Maduro to speak by phone with Trump. The statement said, \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela - the third-largest supplier to the U.S. - would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nEyes on Pence\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly expanded Panama canal.\n\nPence had already been expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The vice president's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.\n\nUsed to violence\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader.

Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region later this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nInformation Minister Ernesto Villegas called Trump's remarks \"the most grave and insolent threat ever taken against the fatherland of Bolivar,\" referring to the nation's independence hero. He called on all \"good-minded\" Venezuelans to unite to reject foreign intervention.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n__\n\nGoodman reported from Caracas, Venezuela. Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Trump weighed in on the ongoing Venezuelan crisis Friday when he refused to \"rule out a military option.\" The Trump administration previously slapped sanctions on Venezuela after the country's July 30 vote allowed Maduro to stack the 545-member Constituent Assembly with his loyal supporters.\n\n\"Today, Nicolas Maduro requested a phone call with President Donald J. Trump,\" the office of the White House press secretary said in a statement Friday. \"Since the start of this Administration, President Trump has asked that Maduro respect Venezuela's constitution, hold free and fair elections, release political prisoners, cease all human rights violations, and stop oppressing Venezuela's great people.\"\n\n\"The Maduro regime has refused to heed this call, which has been echoed around the region and the world. Instead Maduro has chosen the path of dictatorship,\" the statement continued. \"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela in the face of their continued oppression by the Maduro regime. President Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nTrump made waves Friday when he told reporters that he was mulling over the idea of military intervention in Venezuela, as well as other options to pressure Maduro's regime.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela. And by the way, I am not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump had said, noting that Venezuela is \"our neighbor.\" \"You know, we are all over the world and we have troops all over the world in places that are very, very far away. Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering, and they are dying. We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary.\"\n\nMore than 120 people have died during the protests that wracked Venezuelan cities since April alone, and the United Nations' human rights office decried the regime's oppression and use of excessive force. Trump addressed the regime's violations earlier in August, saying in a statement that the U.S. \"condemns the actions of the Maduro dictatorship\" and the regime's decision to imprison political opponents illegally.\n\nBut Trump's suggestion of using force to oppose and contain Venezuela's oppressive regime and human rights violations was met with concern from his top advisers, including National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster, who downplayed the suggestion to MSNBC in early August.\n\n\"No. I don't think so,\" McMaster said of the possibility that the U.S. could intervene in Venezuela directly. \"What's really required is for everyone to have one voice about the need to protect the rights and the safety of the Venezuelan people.\"\n\nMaduro revamped his criticism of Trump as the leader of an \"imperial power\" Thursday during a speech before the Constituent Assembly.\n\n\"With Donald Trump, a dangerous class of lobbyists, multimillionaires and extreme right-wingers reached the presidency, capturing all of the positions of power in the government,\" Maduro said. \"Today, they are threatening world peace.\"\n\n\"If he is so interested in Venezuela, here I am,\" Maduro added. \"Mr. Donald Trump, here is my hand.\"\n\n(photo credit, homepage and article images: Andr\u00e9s E.

Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region later this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.\n\nGet news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up! I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site consitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nInformation Minister Ernesto Villegas called Trump's remarks \"the most grave and insolent threat ever taken against the fatherland of Bolivar,\" referring to the nation's independence hero. He called on all \"good-minded\" Venezuelans to unite to reject foreign intervention.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n-- --\n\nGoodman reported from Caracas, Venezuela. Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Venezuela has in turn accused America of \"imperialist aggression.\"\n\nBut Trump's latest comments were the first sign that he is mulling military intervention.\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters.\n\n\"We have troops all over the world in places that are very far away. Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and they're dying.\"\n\nTrump said Venezuela's political crisis was among the topics discussed at the talks he hosted at his golf club in New Jersey with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"Venezuela is a mess. It is very dangerous mess and a very sad situation,\" Trump said.\n\nBut if any US military contingency planning is under way, it must be in its early stages. A Pentagon spokesman, Eric Pahon, refused to elaborate on Trump's comments, adding: \"As of right now, the Pentagon has received no orders.\"\n\nPahon cautioned that \"the military conducts contingency planning for a variety of situations. If called upon, we are prepared to support whole-of-government efforts to protect our national interest and safeguard US citizens.\"\n\nThe White House said Trump would only agree to speak with Maduro \"as soon as democracy is restored in that country,\" after the Venezuelan leader requested a phone call with the American president.\n\nTrump's military warning came two days after his administration imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, targeting members of a loyalist assembly installed last week to bolster what Washington calls Maduro's \"dictatorship.\"\n\nGeneral Vladimir Padrino, Venezuela's defence minister, dismissed the threat as \"an act of craziness, an act of supreme extremism.\" \"There is an extremist elite governing the United States and honestly I don't know what's happening, what is going to happen in the world,\" Padrino said.\n\nThe Venezuelan government had previously responded to the sanctions -- which already targeted Maduro himself -- by saying the US was \"making a fool of itself in front of the world.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Maduro declared that Venezuela's new Constituent Assembly holds supreme power over all branches of government, even over his position, and that its work -- ostensibly to rewrite the constitution -- would return \"peace\" to the country.\n\nBut the United States and major Latin American nations allege that Maduro is using the body as a tool to quash dissent, by clamping down on the opposition and the legislature it controls.\n\nThe crisis has fueled the street demonstrations that have gripped Venezuela for the past four months. Nearly 130 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\nThe protests have lost steam in the past week as security forces have stepped up repression and demonstrators have grown discouraged by the opposition's failure to bring about change.\n\nBut hackers have taken up the torch. On Thursday, a group calling itself The Binary Guardians claimed responsibility for a massive cyberattack that cut mobile telephone service to seven million users.\n\nTwo renegade officers behind an attack on an army base in the northwestern city of Valencia to raid its armory last weekend have been captured, Padrino said.\n\n\"Whoever betrays the nation, whoever takes up arms against the FANB will receive exemplary punishment,\" he said, referring to Venezuela's armed forces.\n\nOpposition to Maduro among the oil-exporting country's 30 million citizens increased during a long economic crisis that brought food shortages and hyperinflation to what was once one of Latin America's wealthiest countries. -- AFP", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T04:32:00Z", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "source": {"uri": "omanobserver.om", "title": "Oman Observer", "id": "6225"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:32:00", "url": "http://omanobserver.om/trump-mulling-military-option-venezuela/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8872095", "image": "http://omanobserver.om/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1082478.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "04:32:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

We have many options for Venezuela including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nMore than 120 people have been killed in Venezuela and thousands arrested in over four months of unrest. The government in Caracas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's threat.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have long said U.S. officials were planning an invasion. A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said the U.S. military was ready to support efforts to protect U.S. citizens and America's national interests, but that insinuations by Caracas of a planned U.S. invasion were \"baseless.\"\n\nTrump's suggestion of possible military action came in a week when he has repeatedly threatened a military response if North Korea threatens the United States or its allies.\n\nAsked if U.S. forces would lead an operation in Venezuela, Trump declined to provide details. \"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,\" he said.\n\n\"MADURO MUST BE THRILLED\"\n\nThe president's comments conjured up memories of gunboat diplomacy in Latin America during the 20th century, when the United States regarded its \"backyard\" neighbors to the south as underlings who it could easily intimidate through conspicuous displays of military power.\n\nThe U.S. military has not directly intervened in the region since a 1994-1995 operation that aimed to remove from Haiti a military government installed after a 1991 coup.\n\nTrump's comments could be an asset to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by boosting his credibility as a national defender.\n\n\"Maduro must be thrilled right now,\" said Mark Feierstein, who was a senior aide on Venezuela matters to former U.S. president Barack Obama. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe United States sanctioned Maduro and other Venezuelan officials in July after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures. The assembly's election drew international condemnation and critics have said it removed any remaining checks on Maduro's power.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It has the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America, posing a concern for U.S. officials during the country's mounting turmoil.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the United States. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Washington was just trying to raise awareness of the situation and was not seeking any action by the 15-member Security Council.

Minister Jorge Arreaza said threats of a military operation against Venezuela are an attempt by US President Donald Trump to drag Latin America into a conflict and destabilize the continent.\n\n\"Venezuela rejects in the most categorical and convincing manner the unfriendly and hostile statements by US President Donald Trump... in which he threatens a military invasion against our homeland,\" Arreaza told broadcaster Venezuelana de Televisi\u00f3n.\n\nAccording to the minister, Trump's real aim is not Venezuela, but the whole Latin American continent, which he wants to see in turmoil.\n\n\"The reckless threats of President Donald Trump are designed to draw Latin America and the Caribbean into a conflict that will irrevocably violate stability, peace and security in our region,\" he added.\n\nSeveral Latin American nations came out strongly against US President 's threat of military intervention to solve the ongoing political crisis in Venezuela.\n\nSouth American trade bloc Mercosur rejects the use of force in Venezuela, a day after US President Donald Trump threatened military intervention.\n\nIn a statement, the South American trade bloc Mercosur rejected US President's suggestion that a \"military option\" was possible to solve the ongoing domestic political crisis in Venezuela, saying that, \"The only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialog and diplomacy.\"\n\nThe bloc, which consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, added that \"the repudiation of violence and any option that implies the use of force is inalienable and constitutes the fundamental basis for democratic coexistence.\"\n\nOther South American countries, such as Peru, Mexico, and Colombia, also joined the chorus of Latin American unity against the US with statements of their own, criticizing Washington's threat of military action against Caracas as a move against the United Nations' principles.\n\nThe US President has announced that Washington could take military action against Venezuela and President Nicolas Maduro's power grab.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary,\" Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf club on Friday.\n\nThe president did not answer a question about whether American troops would lead a potential operation, while he added that \"we don't talk about

The opposition saw the move as an overt attempt by President Maduro to accumulate power.\n\nThe Venezuelan government held an election on July 30 and the ruling socialist party won the vote. The political tensions there have seen a rise after Venezuelan people said 'Yes' in an election last week to the formation of a national assembly tasked with dissolving the opposition-led congress and rewrite the constitution, while the vote was boycotted by the opposition.\n\nProtests erupted on the streets, and clashes led to the death of at least 120 people from the two sides.\n\nThe day after election, the US slapped sanctions on Maduro and broadened the sanctions later this week by imposing bans against several members of the assembly. The United States imposed sanctions against 13 current and former Venezuelan officials after doing the same to the country's vice president in February. The US Treasury Department later froze Maduro's US assets and called him a \"dictator\" for pushing ahead with the election.\n\nTrump said in mid-July that Maduro \"dreams of becoming a dictator,\" noting that \"the United States will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles.\"\n\nMeantime, Maduro vowed to stand up to the US for its \"imperialistic\" behavior.\n\n\"We will never cede to foreign powers,\" he said in a speech at the assembly and added that Trump had to end his \"imperialist aggression\" toward Venezuela.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 4103, "textStart": 4096}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T08:01:00Z", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "source": {"uri": "en.farsnews.com", "title": "en.farsnews.com", "id": "36"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:01:00", "url": "http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13960522000773", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8887822", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "08:01:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

General Assembly next month.\n\nThe White House responded to that request by saying Trump would \"gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump bemoaned the South American nation's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table -- including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding that \"a military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nThe comment marked a serious escalation in rhetoric for the United States and threatened to undermine Washington's efforts to rally regional support to isolate Maduro.\n\nVice President Mike Pence kicks off a four-nation tour of Latin America on Sunday with a stop in Colombia, whose government -- the staunchest U.S. ally in South America -- was quick to distance itself from Trump's remarks even while reiterating its concerns about a breakdown of democracy in Venezuela.\n\nIn a statement, Colombia's Foreign Ministry condemned \"military measures and the use of force\" and said all efforts to resolve Venezuela's crisis should be peaceful and respect its sovereignty.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two-dozen current and former officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a pro-government assembly tasked with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nMeeting Saturday, delegates to the constitutional assembly exultantly denounced Trump and shouted anti-American slogans.

You have enough.\"\n\nAlmost from day one since taking office in 2013, the elder Maduro has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves. But most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as the diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader.\n\nNow those claims are likely to be validated in the eyes of many government supporters.\n\nThe threat of military intervention would also seem to contradict the advice of Trump's top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said recently that he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T19:39:00Z", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "source": {"uri": "heraldnet.com", "title": "HeraldNet.com", "id": "10395"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:39:00", "url": "http://www.heraldnet.com/news/venezuela-rejects-trump-talk-of-military-option/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8835995", "image": "http://www.heraldnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/8081216_web1_TSR-venezuela-EDH-170813.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "19:39:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region later this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser.

He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nInformation Minister Ernesto Villegas called Trump's remarks \"the most grave and insolent threat ever taken against the fatherland of Bolivar,\" referring to the nation's independence hero.

General Assembly next month.\n\nThe White House responded to that request by saying Trump would \"gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump bemoaned the South American nation's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table -- including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding that \"a military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nThe comment marked a serious escalation in rhetoric for the United States and threatened to undermine Washington's efforts to rally regional support to isolate Maduro.\n\nVice-President Mike Pence kicks off a four-nation tour of Latin America on Sunday with a stop in Colombia, whose government -- the staunchest U.S. ally in South America -- was quick to distance itself from Trump's remarks even while reiterating its concerns about a breakdown of democracy in Venezuela.\n\nIn a statement, Colombia's Foreign Ministry condemned \"military measures and the use of force\" and said all efforts to resolve Venezuela's crisis should be peaceful and respect its sovereignty.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two-dozen current and former officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a pro-government assembly tasked with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nMeeting Saturday, delegates to the constitutional assembly exultantly denounced Trump and shouted anti-American slogans. Loyalists warned of another Vietnam if Trump were to dare send Marines to Venezuela, as the United States last did in the late 19th century during an earlier period of political unrest.\n\n\"If the impossible scenario of tarnishing our fatherland were ever to occur, our guns would arrive to New York, Mr. Trump, and we would take the White House,\" said Nicolas Maduro, the president's son, to loud applause. \"Solve your own problems, Donald Trump. You have enough.\"\n\nAlmost from day one since taking office in 2013, the elder Maduro has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves. But most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as the diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader.\n\nNow those claims are likely to be validated in the eyes of many government supporters.\n\nThe threat of military intervention would also seem to contradict the advice of Trump's top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said recently that he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\n-- --\n\nFollow Joshua Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T18:03:00Z", "sim": 0.7098039388656616, "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "title": "National Post", "id": "973"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:02:00", "url": "http://nationalpost.com/pmn/news-pmn/us-diplomat-arrives-for-expected-rebuke-from-venezuela/wcm/555374d0-410b-4d0a-b14e-ede8183e36cb", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8832176", "image": "https://nationalpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/xfll101-ap4.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "18:03:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Venezuela has in turn accused America of \"imperialist aggression.\"\n\nBut Friday's latest comments were the first sign that Trump may be mulling military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters in New Jersey.\n\n\"We have troops all over the world in places that are very far away.

A spokesman for the Department of Defense, Eric Pahon, refused to elaborate on Trump's comments, adding: \"As of right now, the Pentagon has received no orders.\n\nTrump's warning came two days after his administration imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, targeting members of a loyalist assembly installed last week to bolster what Washington calls Maduro's \"dictatorship\".\n\nThe Venezuelan government responded to the sanctions -- which already targeted Maduro himself -- by saying the US was \"making a fool of itself in front of the world.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Maduro declared that Venezuela's new Constituent Assembly holds supreme power over all branches of government, even over his position, and that its work -- ostensibly to rewrite the constitution -- would return \"peace\" to the country.\n\nBut the United States and major Latin American nations allege that Maduro is using the body as a tool to quash dissent, by clamping down on the opposition and the legislature it controls.\n\nThe crisis has fuelled the street demonstrations that have gripped Venezuela for the past four months. Nearly 130 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\nThe protests have lost steam in the past week as security forces have stepped up repression and demonstrators have grown discouraged by the opposition's failure to bring about change.\n\nBut hackers have taken up the torch. On Thursday a group calling itself The Binary Guardians claimed responsibility for a massive cyberattack that cut mobile telephone service to seven million users.\n\nOpposition to Maduro among the oil-exporting country's 30 million citizens increased during a long economic crisis that brought food shortages and hyperinflation to what was once of Latin America's wealthiest countries.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:33:00Z", "sim": 0.7098039388656616, "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "title": "digitaljournal.com", "id": "556"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:33:00", "url": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/trump-says-mulling-military-option-on-venezuela/article/499805", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8719290", "image": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/1/0/4/8/0/9/3/i/3/5/2/p-large/89d3486c4458f74ecf891c467d7b4163e93d55a5.jpg", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:33:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

rule out military action against Venezuela in response to the country's descent into political chaos following President Nicolas Maduro's power grab.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, Trump bemoaned the country's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table _ including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,'' Trump volunteered, adding, \"A military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.''\n\nTrump's comment mark a serious escalation in rhetoric for the US, which has up until now stressed a regional approach that encourages Latin American allies to escalate pressure on the Maduro regime. Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region later this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by US oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela _ the third-largest supplier to the US _ would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on US-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,'' said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.''\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long US history of military interventions in the region, General HR McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees'' for the \"tragedy'' that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,'' McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the US and its neighbours to speak with a single voice in defence of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,'' he said.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of US military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option'' in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nInformation Minister Ernesto Villegas called Trump's remarks \"the most grave and insolent threat ever taken against the fatherland of Bolivar,'' referring to the nation's independence hero.

Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region later this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nInformation Minister Ernesto Villegas called Trump's remarks \"the most grave and insolent threat ever taken against the fatherland of Bolivar,\" referring to the nation's independence hero. He called on all \"good-minded\" Venezuelans to unite to reject foreign intervention.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela.

General Assembly next month.\n\nThe White House responded to that request by saying Trump would \"gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump bemoaned the South American nation's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table - including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding that \"a military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nThe comment marked a serious escalation in rhetoric for the United States and threatened to undermine Washington's efforts to rally regional support to isolate Maduro.\n\nVice President Mike Pence kicks off a four-nation tour of Latin America on Sunday with a stop in Colombia, whose government - the staunchest U.S. ally in South America - was quick to distance itself from Trump's remarks even while reiterating its concerns about a breakdown of democracy in Venezuela.\n\nIn a statement, Colombia's Foreign Ministry condemned \"military measures and the use of force\" and said all efforts to resolve Venezuela's crisis should be peaceful and respect its sovereignty.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two-dozen current and former officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a pro-government assembly tasked with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nMeeting Saturday, delegates to the constitutional assembly exultantly denounced Trump and shouted anti-American slogans. Loyalists warned of another Vietnam if Trump were to dare send Marines to Venezuela, as the United States last did in the late 19th century during an earlier period of political unrest.\n\n\"If the impossible scenario of tarnishing our fatherland were ever to occur, our guns would arrive to New York, Mr. Trump, and we would take the White House,\" said Nicolas Maduro, the president's son, to loud applause. \"Solve your own problems, Donald Trump. You have enough.\"\n\nAlmost from day one since taking office in 2013, the elder Maduro has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves. But most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as the diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader.\n\nNow those claims are likely to be validated in the eyes of many government supporters.\n\nThe threat of military intervention would also seem to contradict the advice of Trump's top national security adviser.

We're all over the world and we have troops all over the world that are very, very far away. Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering. And they're dying.\"\n\nThe provocative comments come as Washington has stepped up sanctions against Venezuelan officials in recent weeks and just a day after President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said he wanted to talk to Trump to overcome both nation's differences.\n\nTrump was surrounded by several members of his cabinet, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and National Security Council Advisor Gen. H.R. McMaster.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump said.\n\nThey were the strongest words delivered by Trump since the administration called him a dictator and froze his assets following the July 30 vote in Venezuela that will allow a new constituent assembly to change the Venezuelan constitution and strip current lawmakers of power.\n\nConditions in Venezuela have been gone from bad to worse in recent months as the country has plummeted into a deepening economic crisis amid rising inflation and alarming homicide rate. In recent months, anti-government demonstrations have broken out daily as desperate citizens taken to the streets to protest the lack of even the most basic goods.\n\nOn Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Central and South America where the Venezuela security situation is expected to be discussed.\n\nThe State Department referred questions about possible plans being considered to the White House. The Pentagon hasn't received any orders regarding Venezuela as of this point, a spokesman told McClatchy, referring all further questions to the White House.\n\nCritics quickly slammed Trump for needless escalating a situation that could isolate the United States in a region that has historically opposed heavy handed measures.\n\n\"This is the worst possible approach to take with an already volatile situation in Venezuela,\" said Ben Rhodes who was U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser under President Barack Obama. \"Maduro will grab on to threat from Trump.\"\n\nAmong Venezuela-watchers in Washington, the reaction ranged from laughter to disbelief on Friday evening.\n\n\"On the most benign level, it's not an actual threat, so let's not assume that the Marines are loading up the airplanes right now,\" said Eric Farnsworth, a former State Department official who is now vice president of the Washington-based Council of the Americas.\n\nSome Venezuelans may see hope in the comments, but Farnsworth said they will largely be counterproductive as it allows Maduro and his allies to promote the image of the United States as imperialist bullies.\n\n\"There's a whole cottage industry of anti-American leaders who will seize on anything to portray themselves as victims of the U.S., so this plays into the narrative and you have to be careful of that.\"\n\nOthers thought the president was showing strength in the face of a worsening crisis.\n\n\"The president is obviously growing impatient with a dangerous thug holding 30 million people hostage, with cowardly snipers murdering hungry democracy protesters,\" Roger Noriega, a former U.S. ambassador to the Organization of American States and assistant secretary of state for Western hemisphere affairs told McClatchy. \"I don't think any decent person would blame him for considering options for putting an end to the people's suffering by putting an end to Maduro. Period.\"\n\nMaduro often accuses the United States of plotting invasions and coup attempts. Until now, Washington has always denied it had any military intentions against Venezuela.\n\nWhen Trump was asked if the military options might include U.S. troops on the ground, he demurred.\n\n\"We don't talk about it,\" he said. \"But a military operation...is certainly something we could pursue.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 1320, "textStart": 1313}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:14:00Z", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline", "id": "231"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:14:00", "url": "http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/politics-government/article166835992.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8723268", "image": "http://pics.mcclatchyinteractive.com/news/politics-government/f3t6e3/picture166835987/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/TearGas", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:14:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

McMaster said recently that he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T19:41:00Z", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "title": "theStar.com", "id": "1354"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:41:00", "url": "https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2017/08/12/venezuela-pushes-back-against-trump-talk-of-military-option.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8836157", "image": "https://www.thestar.com/content/dam/thestar/news/world/2017/08/12/venezuela-pushes-back-against-trump-talk-of-military-option/trump-venezuelajpg.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "19:41:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

A Pentagon spokesman, Eric Pahon, refused to elaborate on Trump's comments, adding: \"As of right now, the Pentagon has received no orders.\"\n\nPahon cautioned that \"the military conducts contingency planning for a variety of situations. If called upon, we are prepared to support whole-of-government efforts to protect our national interest and safeguard US citizens.\"\n\nThe White House said Trump would only agree to speak with Maduro \"as soon as democracy is restored in that country,\" after the Venezuelan leader requested a phone call with the American president.\n\nTrump's military warning came two days after his administration imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, targeting members of a loyalist assembly installed last week to bolster what Washington calls Maduro's \"dictatorship.\"\n\nGeneral Vladimir Padrino, Venezuela's defense minister, dismissed the threat as \"an act of craziness, an act of supreme extremism.\"\n\n\"There is an extremist elite governing the United States and honestly I don't know what's happening, what is going to happen in the world,\" Padrino said.\n\nThe Venezuelan government had previously responded to the sanctions - which already targeted Maduro himself - by saying the US was \"making a fool of itself in front of the world.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Maduro declared that Venezuela's new Constituent Assembly holds supreme power over all branches of government, even over his position, and that its work - ostensibly to rewrite the constitution - would return \"peace\" to the country.\n\nBut the United States and major Latin American nations allege that Maduro is using the body as a tool to quash dissent, by clamping down on the opposition and the legislature it controls.\n\nThe crisis has fueled the street demonstrations that have gripped Venezuela for the past four months. Nearly 130 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\nThe protests have lost steam in the past week as security forces have stepped up repression and demonstrators have grown discouraged by the opposition's failure to bring about change.\n\nBut hackers have taken up the torch. On Thursday, a group calling itself The Binary Guardians claimed responsibility for a massive cyberattack that cut mobile telephone service to seven million users.\n\nTwo renegade officers behind an attack on an army base in the northwestern city of Valencia to raid its armory last weekend have been captured, Padrino said.\n\n\"Whoever betrays the nation, whoever takes up arms against the FANB will receive exemplary punishment,\" he said, referring to Venezuela's armed forces.\n\nOpposition to Maduro among the oil-exporting country's 30 million citizens increased during a long economic crisis that brought food shortages and hyperinflation to what was once one of Latin America's wealthiest countries.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T06:03:00Z", "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "title": "khaleejtimes.com", "id": "17167"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:03:00", "url": "http://www.khaleejtimes.com/international/americas/trump-mulling-military-option-on-venezuela", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8750195", "image": "http://www.khaleejtimes.com/storyimage/KT/20170812/ARTICLE/170819791/AR/0/AR-170819791.jpg&NCS_modified=  &imageversion=1by1&exif=.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "06:03:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday threatened military intervention in Venezuela, a surprise escalation in Washington's response to Venezuela's political crisis.\n\nVenezuela has appeared to slide toward a more volatile stage of unrest in recent days, with anti-government forces looting weapons from a military base after the installation of an all-powerful new legislative body.\n\n\"The people are suffering and they are dying. We have many options for Venezuela including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nMore than 120 people have been killed in Venezuela and thousands arrested in over four months of unrest. The government in Caracas did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump's threat.\n\nVenezuelan authorities have long said U.S. officials were planning an invasion. A former military general told Reuters earlier this year that some anti-aircraft missiles had been placed along the country's coast for precisely that eventuality.\n\nIn Washington, the Pentagon said it had not received any orders on Venezuela from the White House. Trump, asked if U.S. forces would lead any operation in Venezuela, declined to provide details.\n\n\"We don't talk about it but a military operation - a military option - is certainly something that we could pursue,\" Trump said.\n\nThe United States sanctioned Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and other Venezuelan officials on July 31 after Maduro established a constituent assembly run by his Socialist Party loyalists and cracked down on opposition figures.\n\nWashington has not placed sanctions on the OPEC member's oil industry, which supplies America with about 740,000 barrels per day of oil.\n\nVenezuela possesses a stockpile of 5,000 Russian-made MANPADS surface-to-air weapons, according to military documents reviewed by Reuters. It is the largest known cache of the weapons in Latin America and a source of concern for U.S. officials amid the country's mounting turmoil.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council was briefed behind closed doors on Venezuela in May at the request of the United States. At the time, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Washington was just trying to raise awareness of the situation and was not seeking any action by the 15-member Security Council.\n\n(Reporting by James Oliphant; Writing by Jason Lange in Washington; Editing by Toni Reinhold and Andrew Hay)", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-31", "textEnd": 1468, "textStart": 1461}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T22:00:00Z", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "title": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "id": "14519"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:52:00", "url": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-threatens-venezuela-military-option-223630700.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8922957", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DdifzKqRN4CWh6.Ci2sTWw--/aD0zMDA7dz00NTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/Reuters/2017-08-11T223732Z_2_LYNXMPED7A1LW_RTROPTP_2_NORTHKOREA-MISSILES-USA.JPG", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "22:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

against US President Donald Trump's threat of military intervention to solve the ongoing political crisis in Venezuela.\n\nSouth American trade bloc Mercosur rejects the use of force in Venezuela, a day after US President Donald Trump threatened military intervention.\n\nIn a statement, the South American trade bloc Mercosur rejected US President's suggestion that a \"military option\" was possible to solve the ongoing domestic political crisis in Venezuela, saying that, \"The only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialog and diplomacy.\"\n\nThe bloc, which consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, added that \"the repudiation of violence and any option that implies the use of force is inalienable and constitutes the fundamental basis for democratic coexistence.\"\n\nOther South American countries, such as Peru, Mexico, and Colombia, also joined the chorus of Latin American unity against the US with statements of their own, criticizing Washington's threat of military action against Caracas as a move against the United Nations' principles.\n\nThe US President has announced that Washington could take military action against Venezuela and President Nicolas Maduro's power grab.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary,\" Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf club on Friday.\n\nThe president did not answer a question about whether American troops would lead a potential operation, while he added that \"we don't talk about it. But a military operation, a military option, is certainly something we could pursue.\"\n\nVenezuela's Defense Minister denounced Trump's \"crazy\" threat of military action amid escalating bilateral tensions over what Caracas views as Washington's meddling in the Latin American country's political crisis.\n\n\"This is an act of craziness, an act of supreme extremism,\" General Vladimir Padrino said in an interview with the state television on Friday.\n\n\"As a soldier, together with the FANB (Venezuela's armed forces) and together with the people, I am certain that we will all be in the first ranks defending the interests and sovereignty of our beloved Venezuela,\" the defense chief added.\n\n\"There is an extremist elite governing the United States and honestly I don't know what's happening, what is going to happen in the world,\" Padrino stressed.\n\nVenezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza also rejected the threat as \"hostile,\" and called on Latin America to unite against Washington.\n\n\"The reckless threat by President Trump aims to drag Latin America and the Caribbean into a conflict that would permanently alter stability, peace, and security in our region,\" he stressed.\n\nVenezuela has been reeling from unrest for several months in a crisis caused by political disagreements -- including on the formation of the National Constituent Assembly -- and shortages of food and medicine and hyperinflation.\n\nPolitical tensions in Venezuela rose recently after Caracas announced plans to establish a Constituent Assembly to take over the opposition-controlled parliament and rewrite the constitution. The opposition saw the move as an overt attempt by President Maduro to accumulate power.\n\nThe Venezuelan government held an election on July 30 and the ruling socialist party won the vote. The political tensions there have seen a rise after Venezuelan people said 'Yes' in an election last week to the formation of a national assembly tasked with dissolving the opposition-led congress and rewrite the constitution, while the vote was boycotted by the opposition.\n\nProtests erupted on the streets, and clashes led to the death of at least 120 people from the two sides.\n\nThe day after election, the US slapped sanctions on Maduro and broadened the sanctions later this week by imposing bans against several members of the assembly.

Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region later this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.\n\nMaduro has accused Washington of conspiring with Venezuela's opposition to seek his ouster.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:08:00Z", "sim": 0.7019608020782471, "source": {"uri": "thestate.com", "title": "The State", "id": "272"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:08:00", "url": "http://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article166817712.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8722777", "image": "http://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/u5jy8s/picture166817702/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Trump_North_Korea_70417.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:08:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

He gave no specifics on what the US would do militarily or whether he would act unilaterally. Vice-President Mike Pence is heading to South America over the weekend, with stops including Colombia, Argentina and Chile.\n\nUS military action in Venezuela risks rekindling regional resentments stemming from past interventions. It also may have the unintended effect of giving Maduro a rallying point for his supporters as he tries to suppress opposition to his policies.\n\nBush knew of plot to depose Chavez, CIA papers show\n\nFor nearly two decades, US presidents have served as something of a rhetorical punchbag for Venezuela's ruling socialists. George W. Bush was dubbed \"Mr Danger\", ridiculed for what was perceived as his reckless foreign policy, and Barack Obama was constantly accused of waging an \"economic war\" that caused rampant food shortages and spiralling inflation.\n\nAfter the late Hugo Chavez rose to power, Yankee bashing became a standard practice when government officials wanted to whip up public support at home and abroad. Leaders point to US support for South American dictators, military interventions, even coups across the region and the Cuban embargo set up during the height of the cold war.\n\nAs the US has increased pressure on Venezuela, the Maduro government has taken some tentative steps to open a channel of communication. Maduro wants to establish a dialogue with Trump, Venezuela's foreign ministry said on Twitter.\n\nVenezuela's Maduro attacks 'devil' Barack Obama\n\nIn a subsequent post, the ministry said Maduro instructed Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza to seek a \"conversation\" between the two heads of state.\n\nMaduro had said on Thursday night that he would be willing to meet Trump at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York.\n\n\"If he's so interested in Venezuela, here I am, the head of his interest,\" Maduro said on state television. \"Here is my hand, here is my word.\"\n\nTrump will agree to speak to Venezuela's leader \"as soon as democracy is restored in that country\", the White House said on Friday night.\n\n\"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela in the face of their continued repression by the Maduro regime. President Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nA military move by Trump could hinder US efforts to build a coordinated international response to Maduro's perceived undermining of democracy in his country, including among Venezuela's neighbours.\n\n'Yesterday the devil was here': Chavez's memorable quotes\n\n\"Frankly, it is irresponsible on his part,\" Andrea Saldarriaga Jimenez, Assistant Director at the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Centre in Washington, said of Trump's statements in a phone interview. \"It undermines all of the diplomatic efforts that the countries have done this week.\"\n\nSaldarriaga Jimenez said Maduro now has \"a narrative to further push for the anti-imperialism message that he has out there\".\n\nLast week, Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said in an MSNBC interview that he didn't think there would be any outside military intervention in Venezuela.\n\nTrump delivered his warning to Venezuela on the same day he threatened to strike back militarily to provocations by North Korea.\n\nThe US has imposed a series of sanctions on people associated with Maduro, freezing their assets in the US and blocking anyone in the US from doing business with them. The deepening political crisis and the threat of additional sanctions has worsened Venezuela's economic turmoil. That has resulted in shortages of food and medicine.\n\nVenezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the world's largest proven oil reserves and is the third biggest source of crude for the US among the penalties still on the table is a ban on imports of Venezuelan oil, which would devastate its economy.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:07:00Z", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "title": "South China Morning Post", "id": "273"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:07:00", "url": "http://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/2106520/trump-warns-potential-us-military-option-venezuela", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8732441", "image": "https://cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/620x356/public/images/methode/2017/08/12/edc821e0-7ef8-11e7-83c9-6be3df13972a_image_hires_095941.jpg?itok=aKzs4RuR", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:07:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon refused to elaborate on Mr Trump's comments, adding: \"As of right now, the Pentagon has received no orders.\"\n\nHe cautioned that \"the military conducts contingency planning for a variety of situations\".\n\n\"If called upon, we are prepared to support whole-of-government efforts to protect our national interest and safeguard US citizens,\" he said.\n\nThe White House said Mr Trump would only agree to speak with Mr Maduro \"as soon as democracy is restored in that country\", after the Venezuelan leader requested a phone call with the US President.\n\nMr Trump's military warning came two days after his administration imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, targeting members of a loyalist assembly installed in a July 30 election to bolster what the US calls Mr Maduro's \"dictatorship\".\n\nGeneral Vladimir Padrino, Venezuela's Defence Minister, dismissed the threat as \"an act of craziness, an act of supreme extremism\".\n\nLast Thursday, Mr Maduro declared that Venezuela's new Constituent Assembly holds supreme power over all branches of government, even over his position, and that its work - ostensibly to rewrite the Constitution - would return \"peace\" to the country.\n\nBut the US and major Latin American nations allege that Mr Maduro is using the body as a tool to quash dissent, by clamping down on the opposition and the legislature it controls.\n\nThe crisis has fuelled protests that have gripped Venezuela for the past four months. Nearly 130 people have been killed in clashes between demonstrators and security forces.\n\nOpposition to Mr Maduro among the country's 30 million citizens increased during a long economic crisis that brought food shortages and hyperinflation to what was once one of Latin America's wealthiest countries.\n\nAGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 2061, "textStart": 2054}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T21:42:00Z", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "title": "The Straits Times", "id": "611"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "21:42:00", "url": "http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-mulls-over-military-option-for-venezuela-crisis", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8847005", "image": "http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2017/08/13/ST_20170813_XVENEZ13_3345277.jpg?itok=iLisy0iQ", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "21:42:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region later this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialise amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbours to speak with a single voice in defence of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.\n\nMaduro has accused Washington of conspiring with Venezuela's opposition to seek his ouster.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defence Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela.

Venezuela has in turn accused America of \"imperialist aggression.\"\n\nBut yesterday's latest comments were the first sign that Trump may be mulling military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters in New Jersey.\n\n\"We have troops all over the world in places that are very far away. Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and they're dying.\"\n\nTrump said Venezuela's political crisis was among the topics discussed at the talks he hosted in New Jersey yesterday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"Venezuela is a mess. It is very dangerous mess and a very sad situation,\" Trump said.\n\nBut if any US military contingency planning is under way, it must be in its early stages. A spokesman for the Department of Defence, Eric Pahon, refused to elaborate on Trump's comments, adding: \"As of right now, the Pentagon has received no orders.\"\n\nAnd the military command responsible for US operations in Latin America, Southern Command, said: \"The military conducts contingency planning for a variety of situations.\n\n\"If called upon, we are prepared to support whole-of-government efforts to protect our national interest and safeguard US citizens. US Southern Command has not received an order.\"\n\nQuash dissent\n\nTrump's warning came two days after his administration imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, targeting members of a loyalist assembly installed last week to bolster what Washington calls Maduro's \"dictatorship\".\n\nThe Venezuelan government responded to the sanctions -- which already targeted Maduro himself -- by saying the US was \"making a fool of itself in front of the world.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Maduro declared that Venezuela's new Constituent Assembly holds supreme power over all branches of government, even over his position, and that its work -- ostensibly to rewrite the constitution -- would return \"peace\" to the country.\n\nBut the United States and major Latin American nations allege that Maduro is using the body as a tool to quash dissent, by clamping down on the opposition and the legislature it controls.\n\nThe crisis has fuelled the street demonstrations that have gripped Venezuela for the past four months. Nearly 130 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\nThe protests have lost steam in the past week as security forces have stepped up repression and demonstrators have grown discouraged by the opposition's failure to bring about change.\n\nBut hackers have taken up the torch. On Thursday a group calling itself The Binary Guardians claimed responsibility for a massive cyberattack that cut mobile telephone service to seven million users.\n\nOpposition to Maduro among the oil-exporting country's 30 million citizens increased during a long economic crisis that brought food shortages and hyperinflation to what was once of Latin America's wealthiest countries. -- AFP", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 101, "textStart": 88}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-12", "textEnd": 161, "textStart": 155}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:48:00Z", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "source": {"uri": "themalaymailonline.com", "title": "themalaymailonline.com", "id": "661"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:48:00", "url": "http://www.themalaymailonline.com/world/article/trump-says-mulling-military-option-on-venezuela", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8726349", "image": "http://www.themalaymailonline.com/uploads/articles/2017/2017-08/170801VenezuelaMaduro.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:48:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

demurred when asked for specifics on any such plan.\n\nNot long after his statement, the Pentagon said the White House had not given it any orders regarding Venezuela but that it was \"prepared to

McMaster said he didn't think outside intervention in Venezuela was a possibility.\n\nThe unexpected remarks were met with dismay by many, both for the likely deleterious effects they would have on international efforts to resolve the crisis in Venezuela as well as for what they seemed to say about the way the Trump administration is approaching international affairs.\n\n(Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, President Donald Trump, and US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley at Trump's Bedminster resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, August 11, 2017.AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)\n\nLeon Panetta, who served as director of the CIA and secretary of defense under President Barack Obama, told Wolf Blitzer on Friday night that he had heard nothing indicating the US was considering military action in Venezuela and was critical of the idea.\n\n\"Considering the number of flash points we're dealing with in a very dangerous world, the last thing we need is another flash point where we may possibly use military force,\" Panetta said.\n\nThough Trump's ability to talk has brought him success in the past, Panetta added, \"when you're president of the United States, when you're the commander and chief, this is not reality TV. This is a situation where you can't just talk down to everybody in the world and expect them to do what you think is right. These are leaders in these countries. They worry about their countries. They worry about what's going to happen. And they take the president of the United States literally. Words count.\"\n\n\"I just think that the president needs to understand, and the people around the president need to make clear, that when we are facing the kind of crisis we are facing now, this is not a time for loose talk,\" Panetta said.\n\n(Fans shout slogans against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government during a ceremony for Venezuela's under-20 soccer team upon their arrival from the FIFA U-20 World Cup, in Caracas, June 13, 2017.Thomson Reuters)\n\nTrump's comments are a dramatic escalation from previous US statements, which have focused on a regional approach to the situation in Venezuela, and they were received negatively.\n\nThe embattled Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has faced months of protests by anti-government demonstrators. Those protests have left at least 120 people dead and led to thousands of arrests.\n\nMaduro has long insisted that his country is dealing with foreign interference, backed by the US, waging an \"economic war\" and seeking to undermine his government. Maduro has called Trump an \"emperor,\" and the US president has called Maduro a \"dictator.\"\n\nThe immediate response to Trump's remarks was that they would lend weight to Maduro's claims.\n\nRead More\n\n\"Open talk of military intervention lets Maduro say he was right all along & his followers fear enough to agree,\" Greg Weeks, a political-science professor at UNC Charlotte, said on Twitter.\n\nDavid Smilde, a professor at Tulane and specialist on Venezuela, said Trump's comments were \"made to order\" for the Venezuelan president and could lead to more repression of the opposition.\n\n(Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's wife and son are members of the new Constituent Assembly\u00a9 AFP/File Federico PARRA)\n\n\"Maduro is going to play this like a fiddle,\" Frank Mora, undersecretary of defense for the Western Hemisphere during the Obama administration, told The Wall Street Journal. \"For much less, he has accused the U.S. of imperialism.

Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region later this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nBut most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader. One website even emerged to keep track of the multiple conspiracy theories spread on state media and Maduro's frequent harangues against Washington.\n\nBut Trump's comments that he won't rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela may yet validate those claims in the eyes of some government supporters.\n\nInformation Minister Ernesto Villegas called Trump's remarks \"the most grave and insolent threat ever taken against the fatherland of Bolivar,\" referring to the nation's independence hero. He called on all \"good-minded\" Venezuelans to unite to reject foreign intervention.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n__\n\nGoodman reported from Caracas, Venezuela. Associated Press writer Lolita C.

Venezuela has in turn accused America of \"imperialist aggression.\"\n\nBut Trump's latest comments were the first sign that he is mulling military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters.\n\n\"We have troops all over the world in places that are very far away. Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and they're dying.\"\n\nTrump said Venezuela's political crisis was among the topics discussed at the talks he hosted at his golf club in New Jersey with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"Venezuela is a mess. It is very dangerous mess and a very sad situation,\" Trump said.\n\nBut if any US military contingency planning is under way, it must be in its early stages. A Pentagon spokesman, Eric Pahon, refused to elaborate on Trump's comments, adding: \"As of right now, the Pentagon has received no orders.\"\n\nPahon cautioned that \"the military conducts contingency planning for a variety of situations.

Venezuela has in turn accused America of \"imperialist aggression.\"\n\nBut Trump's latest comments were the first sign that he is mulling military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump told reporters.\n\n\"We have troops all over the world in places that are very far away. Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and they're dying.\"\n\nTrump said Venezuela's political crisis was among the topics discussed at the talks he hosted at his golf club in New Jersey with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley.\n\n\"Venezuela is a mess. It is very dangerous mess and a very sad situation,\" Trump said.\n\nBut if any US military contingency planning is under way, it must be in its early stages. A Pentagon spokesman, Eric Pahon, refused to elaborate on Trump's comments, adding: \"As of right now, the Pentagon has received no orders.\"\n\nPahon cautioned that \"the military conducts contingency planning for a variety of situations. If called upon, we are prepared to support whole-of-government efforts to protect our national interest and safeguard US citizens.\"\n\n- Quash dissent -\n\nThe White House said Trump would only agree to speak with Maduro \"as soon as democracy is restored in that country,\" after the Venezuelan leader requested a phone call with the American president.\n\nTrump's military warning came two days after his administration imposed new sanctions on Venezuela, targeting members of a loyalist assembly installed last week to bolster what Washington calls Maduro's \"dictatorship.\"\n\nGeneral Vladimir Padrino, Venezuela's defense minister, dismissed the threat as \"an act of craziness, an act of supreme extremism.\"\n\n\"There is an extremist elite governing the United States and honestly I don't know what's happening, what is going to happen in the world,\" Padrino said.\n\nThe Venezuelan government had previously responded to the sanctions -- which already targeted Maduro himself -- by saying the US was \"making a fool of itself in front of the world.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Maduro declared that Venezuela's new Constituent Assembly holds supreme power over all branches of government, even over his position, and that its work -- ostensibly to rewrite the constitution -- would return \"peace\" to the country.\n\nBut the United States and major Latin American nations allege that Maduro is using the body as a tool to quash dissent, by clamping down on the opposition and the legislature it controls.\n\n- Nearly 130 killed -\n\nThe crisis has fueled the street demonstrations that have gripped Venezuela for the past four months. Nearly 130 people have been killed in clashes between protesters and security forces.\n\nThe protests have lost steam in the past week as security forces have stepped up repression and demonstrators have grown discouraged by the opposition's failure to bring about change.\n\nBut hackers have taken up the torch. On Thursday, a group calling itself The Binary Guardians claimed responsibility for a massive cyberattack that cut mobile telephone service to seven million users.\n\nTwo renegade officers behind an attack on an army base in the northwestern city of Valencia to raid its armory last weekend have been captured, Padrino said.\n\n\"Whoever betrays the nation, whoever takes up arms against the FANB will receive exemplary punishment,\" he said, referring to Venezuela's armed forces.\n\nOpposition to Maduro among the oil-exporting country's 30 million citizens increased during a long economic crisis that brought food shortages and hyperinflation to what was once one of Latin America's wealthiest countries.\n\nburs-rmb-oh/mtp", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T03:38:00Z", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "title": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "id": "18491"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "15:26:00", "url": "https://sg.news.yahoo.com/trump-mulling-military-option-venezuela-044710841.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8809876", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/xpG6gdXu67ZplXOusXo_hA--/aD01NDg7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/09f342b7bcda8b3595745ec528c1fcf7efc3d948.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "03:38:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

General Assembly next month.\n\nThe White House responded to that request by saying Trump would \"gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump bemoaned the South American nation's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table -- including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding that \"a military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nThe comment marked a serious escalation in rhetoric for the United States and threatened to undermine Washington's efforts to rally regional support to isolate Maduro.\n\nVice President Mike Pence kicks off a four-nation tour of Latin America on Sunday with a stop in Colombia, whose government -- the staunchest U.S. ally in South America -- was quick to distance itself from Trump's remarks even while reiterating its concerns about a breakdown of democracy in Venezuela.\n\nIn a statement, Colombia's Foreign Ministry condemned \"military measures and the use of force\" and said all efforts to resolve Venezuela's crisis should be peaceful and respect its sovereignty.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two-dozen current and former officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a pro-government assembly tasked with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nMeeting Saturday, delegates to the constitutional assembly exultantly denounced Trump and shouted anti-American slogans. Loyalists warned of another Vietnam if Trump were to dare send Marines to Venezuela, as the United States last did in the late 19th century during an earlier period of political unrest.\n\n\"If the impossible scenario of tarnishing our fatherland were ever to occur, our guns would arrive to New York, Mr. Trump, and we would take the White House,\" said Nicolas Maduro, the president's son, to loud applause. \"Solve your own problems, Donald Trump. You have enough.\"\n\nAlmost from day one since taking office in 2013, the elder Maduro has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves. But most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as the diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader.\n\nNow those claims are likely to be validated in the eyes of many government supporters.\n\nThe threat of military intervention would also seem to contradict the advice of Trump's top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said recently that he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T18:08:00Z", "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "source": {"uri": "centredaily.com", "title": "centredaily", "id": "11117"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:08:00", "url": "http://www.centredaily.com/news/nation-world/article166893912.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8827016", "image": "http://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/y3ykmg/picture166817692/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Venezuela_Political_Crisis_24596.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "18:08:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

And, by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" said Trump. \"We have many options for Venezuela. This is our neighbor ... we're all over the world, and we have troops all over the world in places that are very, very far away.\n\n\"Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and they're dying,\" he continued. \"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary.\"\n\nMilitary engagement in the turmoil in the South American country would mark a vast escalation in U.S. participation, which has thus far been limited to rebukes from the White House and economic sanctions.\n\nLast week, national security adviser Gen. H.R. McMaster appeared at a White House press briefing to read a statement from Trump that noted the current Venezuelan \"regime\" \"refused to heed\" a call for \"free and fair\" elections.\n\n\"Maduro is not just a bad leader, he is now a dictator,\" said McMaster, who accused the Venezuelan president of seizing \"absolute power\" through a \"sham election.\"\n\n\"The United States stands with the people of Venezuela in the face of this oppression,\" McMaster added.\n\nDuring the same briefing, Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin announced sanctions to freeze \"all assets of Maduro subject to U.S. jurisdiction\" and restrict U.S. deals with the leader.\n\nWhen asked about military options following Trump's comments Friday, a U.S. official told ABC News that \"the State Department still has the lead.\"\n\nA Department of Defense spokesperson said, \"The Pentagon has received no orders as of yet. The military conducts contingency planning for a variety of situations. If called upon, we are prepared to support whole of government efforts to protect our national interest and safeguard U.S. citizens.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Maduro referenced Trump during an address to the Venezuelan constitutional assembly, inviting a dialogue with the American leader.\n\nFrom New Jersey Friday, Trump would not comment on the possibility of a \"regime change\" in the country when it was raised during a question that also asked about the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and North Korea.\n\n\"I don't want to comment because I think they're very different places so I don't want to comment,\" said Trump.\n\n\"I support peace. I support safety. And I support having to get very tough if we have to to protect the American people and also to protect our allies,\" he added.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:44:00Z", "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "source": {"uri": "wimsradio.com", "title": "wimsradio.com", "id": "11711"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "04:38:00", "url": "http://www.wimsradio.com/2017/08/11/trump-says-he-wont-rule-out-a-military-option-in-venezuela/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8743909", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:44:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Jorge Arreaza in a meeting with foreign diplomats, including Lee McClenny, the top diplomat at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas.\n\nCalling Trump the \"boss of the empire,\" Arreaza said Trump's latest comments fit a pattern of aggression against Venezuelan sovereignty and constitute a violation of international law and the U.N. charter.\n\nHe said they were particularly menacing given President Nicolas Maduro's renewed call this week for closer ties and request for a meeting with Trump at the U.N. General Assembly next month.\n\nThe White House responded to that request by saying Trump would \"gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump bemoaned the South American nation's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table -- including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding that \"a military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nThe comment marked a serious escalation in rhetoric for the United States and threatened to undermine Washington's efforts to rally regional support to isolate Maduro.\n\nVice President Mike Pence kicks off a four-nation tour of Latin America on Sunday with a stop in Colombia, whose government -- the staunchest U.S. ally in South America -- was quick to distance itself from Trump's remarks even while reiterating its concerns about a breakdown of democracy in Venezuela.\n\nIn a statement, Colombia's Foreign Ministry condemned \"military measures and the use of force\" and said all efforts to resolve Venezuela's crisis should be peaceful and respect its sovereignty.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two-dozen current and former officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a pro-government assembly tasked with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nMeeting Saturday, delegates to the constitutional assembly exultantly denounced Trump and shouted anti-American slogans. Loyalists warned of another Vietnam if Trump were to dare send Marines to Venezuela, as the United States last did in the late 19th century during an earlier period of political unrest.\n\n\"If the impossible scenario of tarnishing our fatherland were ever to occur, our guns would arrive to New York, Mr. Trump, and we would take the White House,\" said Nicolas Maduro, the president's son, to loud applause. \"Solve your own problems, Donald Trump. You have enough.\"\n\nAlmost from day one since taking office in 2013, the elder Maduro has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves. But most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as the diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader.\n\nNow those claims are likely to be validated in the eyes of many government supporters.\n\nThe threat of military intervention would also seem to contradict the advice of Trump's top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said recently that he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T03:40:00Z", "sim": 0.6901960968971252, "source": {"uri": "thegardenisland.com", "title": "Thegardenisland.com", "id": "11517"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:40:00", "url": "http://thegardenisland.com/news/world/venezuela-rejects-trump-talk-of-military-option/article_a49f8850-debf-5771-9e0b-8b65e0d0a1fb.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8868522", "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thegardenisland.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/ac/1ac2291f-55d2-5cd8-b807-5101be0e07cf/598fba762f6fc.image.jpg?resize=384%2C512", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "03:40:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

We're all over the world and we have troops all over the world that are very, very far away. Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering. And they're dying.\"\n\nThe provocative comments come as Washington has stepped up sanctions against Venezuelan officials in recent weeks and just a day after President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said he wanted to talk to Trump to overcome both nation's differences.\n\nTrump was surrounded by several members of his cabinet, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley and National Security Council Advisor Gen. H.R. McMaster.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary,\" Trump said.\n\nThey were the strongest words delivered by Trump since the administration called him a dictator and froze his assets following the July 30 vote in Venezuela that will allow a new constituent assembly to change the Venezuelan constitution and strip current lawmakers of power.\n\nConditions in Venezuela have been gone from bad to worse in recent months as the country has plummeted into a deepening economic crisis amid rising inflation and alarming homicide rate. In recent months, anti-government demonstrations have broken out daily as desperate citizens taken to the streets to protest the lack of even the most basic goods.\n\nOn Sunday, Vice President Mike Pence will travel to Central and South America where the Venezuela security situation is expected to be discussed.\n\nThe State Department referred questions about possible plans being considered to the White House. The Pentagon hasn't received any orders regarding Venezuela as of this point, a spokesman told McClatchy, referring all further questions to the White House.\n\nCritics quickly slammed Trump for needless escalating a situation that could isolate the United States in a region that has historically opposed heavy handed measures.\n\n\"This is the worst possible approach to take with an already volatile situation in Venezuela,\" said Ben Rhodes who was U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser under President Barack Obama. \"Maduro will grab on to threat from Trump.\"\n\nAmong Venezuela-watchers in Washington, the reaction ranged from laughter to disbelief on Friday evening.\n\n\"On the most benign level, it's not an actual threat, so let's not assume that the Marines are loading up the airplanes right now,\" said Eric Farnsworth, a former State Department official who is now vice president of the Washington-based Council of the Americas.\n\nSome Venezuelans may see hope in the comments, but Farnsworth said they will largely be counterproductive as it allows Maduro and his allies to promote the image of the United States as imperialist bullies.\n\n\"There's a whole cottage industry of anti-American leaders who will seize on anything to portray themselves as victims of the U.S., so this plays into the narrative and you have to be careful of that.\"\n\nMaduro often accuses the United States of plotting invasions and coup attempts. Until now, Washington has always denied it had any military intentions against Venezuela.\n\nWhen Trump was asked if the military options might include U.S. troops on the ground, he demurred.\n\n\"We don't talk about it,\" he said. \"But a military operation...is certainly something we could pursue.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 1320, "textStart": 1313}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:52:00Z", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "title": "The Kansas City Star", "id": "577"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:52:00", "url": "http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article166835992.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8721330", "image": "http://pics.mcclatchyinteractive.com/news/politics-government/gkphzd/picture166835987/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/TearGas", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:52:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

He gave no specifics on what the U.S. would do militarily or whether he would act unilaterally. Vice President Mike Pence is heading to South America over the weekend, with stops including Colombia, Argentina and Chile.\n\nU.S. military action in Venezuela risks rekindling regional resentments stemming from past interventions. It also may have the unintended effect of giving Maduro a rallying point for his supporters as he tries to suppress opposition to his policies.\n\nFor nearly two decades, U.S. presidents have served as something of a rhetorical punching bag for Venezuela's ruling socialists. George W. Bush was dubbed \"Mr. Danger,\" ridiculed for what was perceived as his reckless foreign policy, and Barack Obama was constantly accused of waging an \"economic war\" that caused rampant food shortages and spiraling inflation.\n\nAfter the late Hugo Chavez rose to power, Yankee bashing became a standard practice when government officials wanted to whip up public support at home and abroad. Leaders point to U.S. support of South American dictators, military interventions, even coups across the region and the Cuban embargo set up during the height of the Cold War.\n\nAs U.S. has increased pressure on Venezuela, the Maduro government has taken some tentative steps to open a channel of communication. Maduro wants to establish a dialog with Trump, Venezuela's Foreign Relations ministry said on Twitter. In a subsequent post, the ministry said Maduro instructed Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza to seek a \"conversation\" between the two heads of state.\n\nMaduro had said on Thursday night that he would be willing to meet with Trump at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York.\n\n\"If he's so interested in Venezuela, here I am, the head of his interest,\" Maduro said on state television. \"Here is my hand, here is my word.\"\n\nThe White House said in a statement that Trump \"will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\" Maduro ignored U.S. calls to restore democracy and instead \"has chosen the path of dictatorship,\" it added.\n\nVenezuela Information Minister Ernesto Villegas, writing on Twitter, called Trump's statement the most \"serious and insolent threat ever made\" against the country. Villegas, speaking on state television afterward, called it \"unprecedented.\" Venezuela's diplomatic corps will meet Saturday, when the Foreign Ministry will issue a statement in response to Trump, Villegas wrote on Twitter.\n\nA military move by Trump could hinder U.S. efforts to build a coordinated international response to Maduro's undermining of democracy in his country, including among Venezuela's neighbors.\n\n\"Frankly, it is irresponsible on his part,\" Andrea Saldarriaga Jim\u00e9nez, Assistant Director at the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center in Washington, said of Trump's statements in a phone interview. \"It undermines all of the diplomatic efforts that the countries have done this week.\"\n\nSaldarriaga Jim\u00e9nez said Maduro now has \"a narrative to further push for the anti-imperialism message that he has out there.\"\n\nLast week, Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said in an MSNBC interview that he didn't think there would be any outside military intervention in Venezuela.\n\nTrump delivered his warning to Venezuela on the same day he threatened to strike back militarily to provocations by North Korea.\n\nThe U.S. has imposed a series of sanctions on people associated with Maduro, freezing their assets in the U.S. and blocking anyone in the U.S. from doing business with them. The deepening political crisis and the threat of additional sanctions has worsened Venezuela's economic turmoil. That has resulted in shortages of food and medicine.\n\nVenezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the world's largest proven oil reserves and is the third-biggest source of crude for the U.S. Among the penalties still on the table is a ban on imports of Venezuelan oil, which would devastate its economy.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T08:23:00Z", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "source": {"uri": "bloomberg.com", "title": "Bloomberg Business", "id": "1749"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:23:00", "url": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-08-12/trump-warns-of-potential-u-s-military-option-in-venezuela", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8764313", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ih1LMrFl_RuQ/v0/1200x800.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "08:23:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

And by the way, I am not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump said. \"We have many options for Venezuela.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is our neighbor. You know, we are all over the world and we have troops all over the world in places that are very, very far away. Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering, and they are dying. We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary.\"\n\nThe Trump administration slapped sanctions on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro after a July 30 vote that allowed the President to replace the opposition-held National Assembly with a new 545-member Constituent Assembly filled with his supporters.\n\nProtests have rocked the streets of Caracas and other Venezuelan cities in response to Maduro's move. The United Nation's' human rights office said earlier this month that Venezuelan security forces have used excessive force and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.\n\n\"The United States condemns the actions of the Maduro dictatorship. Mr. Lopez and Mr. Ledezma are political prisoners being held illegally by the regime,\" Trump said in a statement earlier this month, referencing Leopoldo Lopez and Antonio Ledezma, two of Maduro's top political opponents.\n\nWhile Trump raised the specter of military intervention, his top national security aides have downplayed that possibility.\n\nH.R. McMaster, Trump's National Security Adviser, flatly told MSNBC earlier this month that military intervention from any outside source was not a possibility.\n\n\"No. I don't think so,\" McMaster said. \"What's really required is for everyone to have one voice about the need to protect the rights and the safety of the Venezuelan people.\"\n\nLater Friday, Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon said the Defense Department has not been ordered to make any military movements related to Venezuela -- but is prepared for that if need be.\n\n\"I refer you to the White House to characterize the President's statement. The Pentagon has not received any orders with regards to Venezuela,\" Pahon said. \"The military conducts contingency planning for a variety of situations. If called upon, we are prepared to support ... government efforts to protect our national interests and safeguard US citizens. Any insinuations by the Maduro regime that we are planning an invasion are baseless and are designed to distract from his continued efforts to undermine the democratic process and institutions in Venezuela.\"\n\nTrump's comments came after a meeting at his New Jersey golf club with US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. During the remarks, Trump also announced that he will speak by phone with Chinese President Xi Jinping Friday night about North Korea.\n\nSaber-rattling from the rogue nation has dominated Trump's 17-day working vacation in New Jersey. When asked about the ratcheted-up rhetoric in recent weeks between the US and North Korea, Trump said there are good options on the table for dealing with the tensions, but that a bad option was a possibility.\n\n\"Lots of good things could happen and we also could have a bad solution,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked if that bad solution meant war, Trump declined to say. \"I think you know that answer to that,\" he said.\n\n\"You know what I can say, hopefully it will all work out,\" Trump said. \"Nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump, that I can tell you.\"\n\nTrump has looked to blame the volley of threats between the United States and North Korea on past administrations, arguing that tension with North Korea was thrust upon him.\n\n\"This has been going on for many years, would have been a lot easier to solve this years ago before they were in the position they are in. But we will see what happens,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump told reporters on Friday that the US is considering additional sanctions against North Korea \"at a very, very high level.\"\n\n\"Very strong ones.

McMaster said he didn't think outside intervention in Venezuela was a possibility.\n\nThe unexpected remarks were met with dismay by many, both for the likely deleterious effects they would have on international efforts to resolve the crisis in Venezuela as well as for what they seemed to say about the way the Trump administration is approaching international affairs.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson, President Donald Trump, and US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley at Trump's Bedminster resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, August 11, 2017. AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais\n\nLeon Panetta, who served as director of the CIA and secretary of defense under President Barack Obama, told Wolf Blitzer on Friday night that he had heard nothing indicating the US was considering military action in Venezuela and was critical of the idea.\n\n\"Considering the number of flash points we're dealing with in a very dangerous world, the last thing we need is another flash point where we may possibly use military force,\" Panetta said.\n\nThough Trump's ability to talk has brought him success in the past, Panetta added, \"when you're president of the United States, when you're the commander and chief, this is not reality TV. This is a situation where you can't just talk down to everybody in the world and expect them to do what you think is right. These are leaders in these countries. They worry about their countries. They worry about what's going to happen. And they take the president of the United States literally. Words count.\"\n\n\"I just think that the president needs to understand, and the people around the president need to make clear, that when we are facing the kind of crisis we are facing now, this is not a time for loose talk,\" Panetta said.\n\nFans shout slogans against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government during a ceremony for Venezuela's under-20 soccer team upon their arrival from the FIFA U-20 World Cup, in Caracas, June 13, 2017. Thomson Reuters\n\nTrump's comments are a dramatic escalation from previous US statements, which have focused on a regional approach to the situation in Venezuela, and they were received negatively.\n\nThe embattled Venezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has faced months of protests by anti-government demonstrators. Those protests have left at least 120 people dead and led to thousands of arrests.\n\nMaduro has long insisted that his country is dealing with foreign interference, backed by the US, waging an \"economic war\" and seeking to undermine his government. Maduro has called Trump an \"emperor,\" and the US president has called Maduro a \"dictator.\"\n\nThe immediate response to Trump's remarks was that they would lend weight to Maduro's claims.\n\n\"Open talk of military intervention lets Maduro say he was right all along & his followers fear enough to agree,\" Greg Weeks, a political-science professor at UNC Charlotte, said on Twitter.\n\nDavid Smilde, a professor at Tulane and specialist on Venezuela, said Trump's comments were \"made to order\" for the Venezuelan president and could lead to more repression of the opposition.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's wife and son are members of the new Constituent Assembly \u00a9 AFP/File Federico PARRA\n\n\"Maduro is going to play this like a fiddle,\" Frank Mora, undersecretary of defense for the Western Hemisphere during the Obama administration, told The Wall Street Journal. \"For much less, he has accused the U.S. of imperialism.

I mean, this just plays right in to [his] whole narrative.\"\n\nVenezuela defense minister called Trump's remarks \"a crazy act,\" and the country's information minister said they were \"the most grave and insolent threat ever taken against the fatherland of Bolivar,\" referring to Venezuela's independence hero.\n\nThis week, 17 countries from the region condemned the \"breakdown of democratic order\" in Venezuela, but Trump's comments appear likely to send a chill through a region that had started to move toward action against the Venezuelan government and to isolate Maduro.\n\nMark Feierstein, who was senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs and special assistant to Obama, said Trump's comments would set back the work of his National Security Council by \"undercutting Venezuelan opposition and alienating the region.\"\n\nA government supporter holds a poster with images of Venezuela's late President Hugo Chavez and President Nicolas Maduro during a simulation of the government's official July 30 vote for a new assembly, in Caracas, July 16, 2017. REUTERS/Christian Veron\n\n\"Maduro's absurd claims that he's protecting Venezuela against U.S. threat have now been validated,\" Feierstein said on Twitter. \"He must be thrilled with Trump statement.\"\n\nThe US has hit Venezuelan officials with several rounds of sanctions over the past few weeks.\n\nThirteen were sanctioned during the last week of July, days ahead of a widely rejected constituent-assembly vote that critics have said was aimed at consolidating the Maduro government's power.\n\nFollowing the vote, Maduro himself was hit with sanctions, and this week the US government sanctioned eight more officials.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is heading to Latin America next week to offer support for the Colombian peace process and address the increase of coca cultivation in that country, as well as start work on possible bilateral trade deals. Pence's trip was also meant to reinforce regional opposition to Maduro's government.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-04", "textEnd": 109, "textStart": 95}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 1319, "textStart": 1304}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-06-13", "textEnd": 2732, "textStart": 2719}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 5291, "textStart": 5284}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-16", "textEnd": 5342, "textStart": 5329}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T06:37:00Z", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "source": {"uri": "uk.businessinsider.com", "title": "Business Insider", "id": "4816"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:28:00", "url": "http://uk.businessinsider.com/trump-military-action-on-venezuela-could-be-counterproductive-2017-8", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8867305", "image": "http://static5.uk.businessinsider.com/image/598e57450dafe8106f1d83fc-1190-625/this-is-not-a-time-for-loose-talk-trumps-latest-threats-against-venezuela-could-haunt-him.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "06:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region later this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela - the third-largest supplier to the U.S. - would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.\n\nMaduro has accused Washington of conspiring with Venezuela's opposition to seek his ouster.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela.

The United Nation's' human rights office said earlier this month that Venezuelan security forces have used excessive force and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.\" The United States condemns the actions of the Maduro dictatorship.\n\nVenezuelan security forces have wielded excessive force to suppress protests, killing dozens, and have arbitrarily detained 5,000 people since April, including 1,000 still in custody. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said in a statement: \"These violations have occurred amid the breakdown of the rule of law in Venezuela, with constant attacks by the Government against the National Assembly and the Attorney-General's Office.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 1091, "textStart": 1084}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:40:00Z", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "title": "freepressjournal.in", "id": "12557"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:40:00", "url": "http://www.freepressjournal.in/world/military-option-for-venezuela-on-the-table-donald-trump/1119914", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8734681", "image": "http://www.freepressjournal.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Donald-Trump.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:40:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

General Assembly next month.\n\nThe White House responded to that request by saying Trump would \"gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters Friday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump bemoaned the South American nation's growing humanitarian crisis and declared that all options remain on the table - including a potential military intervention.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela and by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option,\" Trump volunteered, adding that \"a military operation and military option is certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nThe comment marked a serious escalation in rhetoric for the United States and threatened to undermine Washington's efforts to rally regional support to isolate Maduro.\n\nVice President Mike Pence kicks off a four-nation tour of Latin America on Sunday with a stop in Colombia, whose government - the staunchest U.S. ally in South America - was quick to distance itself from Trump's remarks even while reiterating its concerns about a breakdown of democracy in Venezuela.\n\nIn a statement, Colombia's Foreign Ministry condemned \"military measures and the use of force\" and said all efforts to resolve Venezuela's crisis should be peaceful and respect its sovereignty.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two-dozen current and former officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a pro-government assembly tasked with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nMeeting Saturday, delegates to the constitutional assembly exultantly denounced Trump and shouted anti-American slogans. Loyalists warned of another Vietnam if Trump were to dare send Marines to Venezuela, as the United States last did in the late 19th century during an earlier period of political unrest.\n\n\"If the impossible scenario of tarnishing our fatherland were ever to occur, our guns would arrive to New York, Mr. Trump, and we would take the White House,\" said Nicolas Maduro, the president's son, to loud applause. \"Solve your own problems, Donald Trump. You have enough.\"\n\nAlmost from day one since taking office in 2013, the elder Maduro has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves. But most Venezuelans tended to shrug the accusations off as the diversionary tactics of an unpopular leader.\n\nNow those claims are likely to be validated in the eyes of many government supporters.\n\nThe threat of military intervention would also seem to contradict the advice of Trump's top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said recently that he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\n___\n\nFollow Joshua Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T19:09:00Z", "sim": 0.6666666865348816, "source": {"uri": "actionnewsjax.com", "title": "WJAX", "id": "1040"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:09:00", "url": "http://www.actionnewsjax.com/news/us-diplomat-arrives-for-expected-rebuke-from-venezuela/589532020", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8832918", "image": "https://cmgfeeds.cmgdigital.com/photo/2017/08/12/Venezuela_Political_Crisis_24596_8839654_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "19:09:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

He gave no specifics on what the US would do militarily or whether he would act unilaterally. Vice president Mike Pence is heading to South America over the weekend, with stops including Colombia, Argentina and Chile.\n\nUS military action in Venezuela risks rekindling regional resentments stemming from past interventions. It also may have the unintended effect of giving Maduro a rallying point for his supporters as he tries to suppress opposition to his policies.\n\nFor nearly two decades, US presidents have served as something of a rhetorical punching bag for Venezuela's ruling socialists. George W. Bush was dubbed \"Mr. Danger,\" ridiculed for what was perceived as his reckless foreign policy, and Barack Obama was constantly accused of waging an \"economic war\" that caused rampant food shortages and spiraling inflation.\n\nAfter the late Hugo Chavez rose to power, Yankee bashing became a standard practice when government officials wanted to whip up public support at home and abroad. Leaders point to US support of South American dictators, military interventions, even coups across the region and the Cuban embargo set up during the height of the Cold War.\n\nOpen dialogue\n\nAs US has increased pressure on Venezuela, the Maduro government has taken some tentative steps to open a channel of communication. Maduro wants to establish a dialogue with Trump, Venezuela's foreign relations ministry said on Twitter. In a subsequent post, the ministry said Maduro instructed foreign minister Jorge Arreaza to seek a \"conversation\" between the two heads of state.\n\nMaduro had said on Thursday night that he would be willing to meet with Trump at the upcoming United Nations general assembly meeting in New York.\n\n\"If he's so interested in Venezuela, here I am, the head of his interest,\" Maduro said on state television. \"Here is my hand, here is my word.\"\n\nHinder diplomacy\n\nA military move by Trump could hinder US efforts to build a coordinated international response to Maduro's undermining of democracy in his country, including among Venezuela's neighbours.\n\n\"Frankly, it is irresponsible on his part,\" Andrea Saldarriaga Jim\u00e9nez, assistant director at the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Centre in Washington, said of Trump's statements in a phone interview. \"It undermines all of the diplomatic efforts that the countries have done this week.\"\n\nSaldarriaga Jim\u00e9nez said Maduro now has \"a narrative to further push for the anti-imperialism message that he has out there.\"\n\nLast week, Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said in an MSNBC interview that he didn't think there would be any outside military intervention in Venezuela.\n\nTrump delivered his warning to Venezuela on the same day he threatened to strike back militarily to provocations by North Korea.\n\nThe US has imposed a series of sanctions on people associated with Maduro, freezing their assets in the US and blocking anyone in the US from doing business with them. The deepening political crisis and the threat of additional sanctions has worsened Venezuela's economic turmoil. That has resulted in shortages of food and medicine.\n\nVenezuela, a founding member of Opec, has the world's largest proven oil reserves and is the third biggest source of crude for the US. Among the penalties still on the table is a ban on imports of Venezuelan oil, which would devastate its economy.

Trump's statement suggested the U.S. may get more deeply involved in Venezuela, which has been subject to increasing sanctions since President Nicolas Maduro convened a national assembly designed to rewrite the country's constitution and consolidate his power.\n\n\"Venezuela is not very far away, and the people are suffering, and they're dying.\" Trump said during a brief news conference Friday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. \"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary.\"\n\nThe president declined to say whether the U.S. would seek to overthrow Maduro. He gave no specifics on what the U.S. would do militarily or whether he would act unilaterally. Vice President Mike Pence is heading to South America over the weekend, with stops including Colombia, Argentina and Chile. U.S. military action in Venezuela risks rekindling regional resentments stemming from past interventions. It also may have the unintended effect of giving Maduro a rallying point for his supporters as he tries to suppress opposition to his policies.\n\nWatch video here:\n\nFor nearly two decades, U.S. presidents have served as something of a rhetorical punching bag for Venezuela's ruling socialists. George W. Bush was dubbed \"Mr. Danger,\" ridiculed for what was perceived as his reckless foreign policy, and Barack Obama was constantly accused of waging an \"economic war\" that caused rampant food shortages and spiraling inflation.\n\nAfter the late Hugo Chavez rose to power, Yankee bashing became a standard practice when government officials wanted to whip up public support at home and abroad. Leaders point to U.S. support of South American dictators, military interventions, even coups across the region and the Cuban embargo set up during the height of the Cold War.\n\nOpen Dialog\n\nAs U.S. has increased pressure on Venezuela, the Maduro government has taken some tentative steps to open a channel of communication. Maduro wants to establish a dialog with Trump, Venezuela's Foreign Relations ministry said on Twitter. In a subsequent post, the ministry said Maduro instructed Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza to seek a \"conversation\" between the two heads of state.\n\nMaduro had said on Thursday night that he would be willing to meet with Trump at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York. \"If he's so interested in Venezuela, here I am, the head of his interest,\" Maduro said on state television. \"Here is my hand, here is my word.\"\n\nHinder Diplomacy\n\nA military move by Trump could hinder U.S. efforts to build a coordinated international response to Maduro's undermining of democracy in his country, including among Venezuela's neighbors. \"Frankly, it is irresponsible on his part,\" Andrea Saldarriaga Jim\u00e9nez, Assistant Director at the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center in Washington, said of Trump's statements in a phone interview. \"It undermines all of the diplomatic efforts that the countries have done this week.\"\n\nSaldarriaga Jim\u00e9nez said Maduro now has \"a narrative to further push for the anti-imperialism message that he has out there.\" Last week, Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said in an MSNBC interview that he didn't think there would be any outside military intervention in Venezuela.\n\nTrump delivered his warning to Venezuela on the same day he threatened to strike back militarily to provocations by North Korea. The U.S. has imposed a series of sanctions on people associated with Maduro, freezing their assets in the U.S. and blocking anyone in the U.S. from doing business with them. The deepening political crisis and the threat of additional sanctions has worsened Venezuela's economic turmoil. That has resulted in shortages of food and medicine.\n\nVenezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the world's largest proven oil reserves and is the third biggest source of crude for the U.S. Among the penalties still on the table is a ban on imports of Venezuelan oil, which would devastate its economy.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T08:40:00Z", "sim": 0.6627451181411743, "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "title": "The Financial Express", "id": "4684"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:40:00", "url": "http://www.financialexpress.com/world-news/us-intervention-in-venezuela-could-spread-turmoil-in-latin-america/805439/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8766160", "image": "http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/08/TRUMP-AP.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "08:40:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region later this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\nThe trip was already sure to be dominated by discussion of Venezuela, with Pence expected to call on the leaders to continue to pressure the Maduro government and encourage others in the region to do the same.\n\nBut Trump's comments are likely to upend the conversations, with leaders potentially pressing Pence for reassurance that Trump won't go through with his military threat.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.\n\nMaduro has accused Washington of conspiring with Venezuela's opposition to seek his ouster.\n\nAt the Pentagon, spokesman Mark Wright said the Defense Department continuously conducts contingency planning for possible military actions all around the world. \"Our job is to be prepared and be able to offer those options to the president,\" he said.\n\nStill, a senior U.S. official said the Pentagon is unaware of any coming military action in Venezuela.

Meanwhile, one reporter circled back to North Korea during Trump's appearance, asking, \"Is the US going to go to war?\" after Trump mentioned a possible \"bad solution\" to the Korea problem, per CBS News. \"I think you know the answer to that,\" the president replied.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:39:00Z", "sim": 0.6470588445663452, "source": {"uri": "newser.com", "title": "Newser", "id": "851"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:39:00", "url": "http://www.newser.com/story/247106/trump-us-could-take-possible-military-option-on-venezuela.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8725452", "image": "http://img1-azcdn.newser.com/image/1136976-12-20170811191512.jpeg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:39:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Hours before Trump's comments, a senior administration official speaking on condition of anonymity stressed that approach while briefing reporters on Vice President Mike Pence's upcoming trip to the region later this week.\n\nThe Trump administration has slapped a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials in response to a crackdown on opposition leaders and the recent election of a constitutional assembly charged with rewriting the country's constitution.\n\nBut even as the list of targeted individuals has grown longer, promised economic sanctions have yet to materialize amid an outcry by U.S. oil companies over the likelihood that a potential ban on petroleum imports from Venezuela -- the third-largest supplier to the U.S. -- would hurt U.S. jobs and drive up gas costs.\n\nTrump's comments are sure to focus new attention on Pence's upcoming six-day tour of the region, which will include stops in Cartagena, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. Pence is set to arrive in Colombia on Sunday and is expected to meet with each of the countries' leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations and tour the newly-expanded Panama canal.\n\n\"The Vice President's trip will highlight the divide between the past and present of Latin America,\" said Jarrod Agen, a Pence spokesman, in a statement sent before Trump's comments. \"Venezuela represents the past, with the failed path of tyranny and oppression, but Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama represent the future of freedom, opportunity and prosperity.\"\n\nTrump's threat of military intervention in Venezuela also seems to contradict the advice of his top national security adviser. Citing the resentment stirred in Latin America by the long U.S. history of military interventions in the region, General H.R. McMaster said he didn't want to give Maduro any ammunition to blame the \"Yankees\" for the \"tragedy\" that has befallen the oil-rich nation.\n\n\"You've seen Maduro have some lame attempts to try to do that already,\" McMaster said in an interview that aired last Saturday on MSNBC.\n\nRather than send in the Marines, McMaster said it was important for the U.S. and its neighbors to speak with a single voice in defense of Venezuela's democracy.\n\n\"It's important for us to place responsibility for this catastrophe on Maduro's shoulders. He is the one who has caused it, and he's the one who's perpetuating it,\" he said.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T22:39:00Z", "sim": 0.6431372761726379, "source": {"uri": "tulsaworld.com", "title": "Tulsa World", "id": "3086"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "15:08:00", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/homepagelatest/trump-says-he-won-t-rule-out-military-response-to/article_bcb0227b-9b2b-57e5-9520-039447edc62f.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8808155", "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/8c/58c9738d-fa90-5db9-a021-85a944a01211/598e408f688d9.image.jpg?resize=512%2C331", "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "22:39:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

He gave no specifics on what the U.S. would do militarily or whether he would act unilaterally. Vice President Mike Pence is heading to South America over the weekend, with stops including Colombia, Argentina and Chile.\n\nU.S. military action in Venezuela risks rekindling regional resentments stemming from past interventions. It also may have the unintended effect of giving Maduro a rallying point for his supporters as he tries to suppress opposition to his policies.\n\nFor nearly two decades, U.S. presidents have served as something of a rhetorical punching bag for Venezuela's ruling socialists. George W. Bush was dubbed \"Mr. Danger,\" ridiculed for what was perceived as his reckless foreign policy, and Barack Obama was constantly accused of waging an \"economic war\" that caused rampant food shortages and spiraling inflation.\n\nAfter the late Hugo Chavez rose to power, Yankee bashing became a standard practice when government officials wanted to whip up public support at home and abroad. Leaders point to U.S. support of South American dictators, military interventions, even coups across the region and the Cuban embargo set up during the height of the Cold War.\n\nAs U.S. has increased pressure on Venezuela, the Maduro government has taken some tentative steps to open a channel of communication. Maduro wants to establish a dialog with Trump, Venezuela's Foreign Relations ministry said on Twitter. In a subsequent post, the ministry said Maduro instructed Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza to seek a \"conversation\" between the two heads of state.\n\nA military move by Trump also could hinder U.S. efforts to build a coordinated international response to Maduro's undermining of democracy in his country, including among Venezuela's neighbors.\n\n\"Frankly, it is irresponsible on his part,\" Andrea Saldarriaga Jim\u00e9nez, Assistant Director at the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center in Washington, said of Trump's statements in a phone interview. \"It undermines all of the diplomatic efforts that the countries have done this week.\"\n\nSaldarriaga Jim\u00e9nez said Maduro now has \"a narrative to further push for the anti-imperialism message that he has out there.\"\n\nLast week, Trump's national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, said in an MSNBC interview that he didn't think there would be any outside military intervention in Venezuela.\n\nTrump delivered his warning to Venezuela on the same day he threatened to strike back militarily to provocations by North Korea.\n\nThe U.S. has imposed a series of sanctions on people associated with Maduro, freezing their assets in the U.S. and blocking anyone in the U.S. from doing business with them.

We have many options, including a possible military option if necessary.\"\n\nAsked whether he was talking about a U.S.-led operation, Trump said: \"We don't talk about it. But the military option is certainly something we could pursue.\" He did not elaborate.\n\nIt has been years - including Haiti in 2004 and Panama in 1989 and 1994 - since the last direct U.S. military interventions in Latin America. Such action would probably cause uproar in the region and would be questionable under international law.\n\nVice President Pence leaves next week on a trip to South America, where he will visit Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama.\n\nThe upheaval in Venezuela has not posed a discernible threat to U.S. security, although some regional experts have warned of an exodus of Venezuelans to this country if the situation worsens. Until now, the United States has advocated a regional response, through the Organization of American States.\n\nAsked last week whether he anticipated outside military intervention in Venezuela, national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who also attended the New Jersey meeting with Trump and Tillerson, said, \"No, I don't. I don't think so. I think what's really required is for everyone to have one voice about the need to protect the rights and the safety of the Venezuelan people.\"\n\nLate last month, despite nationwide strikes and demonstrations, Maduro pushed through a vote on a new constituent assembly that replaced the opposition-majority parliament and increased his power. In response, the Trump administration imposed a new round of sanctions.\n\nMaduro followed by jailing top opposition leaders. The administration has warned of new economic measures against the government, including a possible embargo on oil shipments from Venezuela, the United States' third largest foreign supplier of oil.\n\nWhile an embargo would cripple Venezuela's oil industry - whose near-collapse is part of an economic disaster that has left food, medicine and other necessities in short supply there - it would also probably increase the price of energy in the United States.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 43, "textStart": 36}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T02:53:00Z", "sim": 0.6352941393852234, "source": {"uri": "nola.com", "title": "NOLA.com", "id": "2072"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:02:00", "url": "http://www.nola.com/national_politics/2017/08/trump_military_option_a_possib.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8736088", "image": "http://image.nola.com/home/nola-media/width620/img/national_politics/photo/23221195-standard.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "02:53:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

But it's unclear why he's weighing the same option for Venezuela.\n\nThe Trump administration, along with many other countries, has been critical of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his creation of a new constituent assembly. It can override the established legislature and rewrite the nation's constitution.\n\nThe European Union and a dozen countries in the Americas condemned the assembly as a power grab by Maduro. And the Trump administration has sanctioned Maduro, calling him a dictator. The elections for the assembly were boycotted by Maduro's opposition. The company that provided the voting machines said over 1 million fraudulent votes were added.\n\nSEE MORE: Venezuela's Controversial Constituent Assembly Opens\n\nDespite the heavy rhetoric, Trump declined to say if he wanted a regime change in either country.\n\n\"I think they're very different places, so I don't want to comment.

reluctance to work with the Republican leader and had adopted a common, confrontational approach aimed at isolating President Nicolas Maduro's embattled government.\n\nWell before Maduro himself responded, governments in Latin America with a long memory of U.S. interventions were quick to express alarm over what sounded to them like saber-rattling. Even Colombia -- Washington's staunchest ally in the region -- condemned any \"military measures and the use of force\" that encroach on Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nMaduro has long accused Washington of having military designs on Venezuela and specifically its vast oil reserves, the world's largest. But those claims were dismissed by many as an attempt to distract from his government's failures to curb problems such as widespread shortages, spiraling inflation and one of the world's worst homicide rates.\n\n\"For years he's been saying the U.S. is preparing an invasion, and everyone laughed. But now the claim has been validated,\" said Mark Feierstein, who served as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe timing of Trump's remarks could not be worse, coming on the eve of a four-nation Latin America trip by Vice President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbor's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word -- dictatorship -- to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba -- a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum -- or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup. Only this time he can point to Trump's words as evidence.\n\nPence arrives in Colombia on Sunday to begin his Latin America tour, during which discussions on how to deal with Venezuela were expected to feature prominently. Instead he may now be forced to do damage control, said Christopher Sabatini, executive director of Global Americans, a website focused on U.S. policy in the region.\n\n\"He's about to get an earful,\" Sabatini said. \"The eagerness of Trump and some people around him to mouth off without any idea of context is really damaging not only to U.S. policy but also regional stability.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T23:30:00Z", "sim": 0.6196078658103943, "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "title": "The Denver Post", "id": "138"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:47:00", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2017/08/12/donald-trump-military-option-venezuela-latin-america/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8876692", "image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ap17224647320704.jpg?w=640", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "23:30:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

of a war with North Korea isn't enough, US President Trump, said on Friday that he is not discarding the \"military option\" against the regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, reported dpa news.\n\n\"I will not rule out the military option,\" he told reporters in New Jersey, where he is spending his long summer vacation.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela. It's our neighbor. We have troops all over the world, in places that are very far away. Venezuela is not far away and people are suffering and dying.\n\nWe have many options, including a possible military option if necessary,\" he insisted. However, he did not mention other options.\n\nIn his remarks to the press Trump was accompanied by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and US Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, with whom he held a meeting.\n\nTrump's words come amid his rhetorical tit-for-tat with North Korea, which has taken on the threat of armed conflict, and a few hours after his Vice President, Mike Pence, begins his first tour of Latin America, which will take him to Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama.\n\nVenezuela was already emerging as the great regional theme of the vice president on his trip and now he will see how the leaders of those four countries react to Trump's declarations, 28 years after the last US military invasion of Latin America. It was the so-called Operation Just Cause, in 1989, with which the Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega was expelled.\n\nInitial reaction from Chile and Colombia and numerous other countries has been negative on the threat of a US attack on Caracas.\n\nThe US administration has been increasing pressure on Maduro in recent weeks, but especially since the election of the Constituent Assembly, imposing more individual sanctions on government officials, who have included the Venezuelan president himself.\n\nHowever the effect of those sanctions, including the freezing of bank accounts in the US, may have no effect if the officials do not have properties and funds in the US.\n\nBut to this day no representative of the administration had publicly spoken of a military option; the threats had always been confined to political and economic options.\n\nThe red line for the United States has been the election of the Constituent Assembly, last July 30.\n\nThe installation of this plenipotentiary body also generated the reaction of 17 countries of the Americas, which on Tuesday issued a strong condemnation in Lima of the crisis in Venezuela and said they will ignore the actions emanating from the Constituent Assembly.\n\nAccording to the White House, Trump today rejected a phone call from Maduro. \"President Trump will speak with pleasure to the Venezuelan leader as soon as democracy is restored in that country,\" a statement said.\n\nIn addition, the statement stressed that since assuming his mandate, Trump has asked his Venezuelan counterpart to respect the Constitution, hold free and fair elections, release \"political prisoners\" and stop committing human rights violations.\n\n\"The Maduro regime refused to comply with this request, which resonated in the region and the world. Instead, Maduro chose the path of dictatorship,\" Trump added.\n\nFollowing the imposition of Treasury Department sanctions this week on eight people related to the Constituent Assembly, including the eldest brother of the late President Hugo Chavez, the big question remained whether the United States was going to impose an oil embargo on Venezuela or any other types of sanctions related to crude oil.\n\n\"All options are on the table today,\" Treasury Secretary Steven T.

She is now president of the new all-powerful and pro-government Constituent Assembly created by a controversial vote last month that has been decried by opponents and foreign governments as fraudulent.\n\nOn national television, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez said: \"This is an act of craziness; it's an act of supreme extremism. There's an extremist elite governing the United States.\"\n\nTrump told journalists Friday: \"We are all over the world, and we have troops all over the world in places that are very far away. Venezuela is not very far away, and the people are suffering and they're dying. We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary.\"\n\nWith all branches of Venezuela's government and the armed forces now under his control, Maduro's biggest weakness appears to be the nation's crumbling economy and growing international isolation.\n\nYet Trump's threats about a \"military option\" appeared to be dividing U.S. allies in the region, risking the unity of Latin American nations that are seeking to pressure Venezuela's authoritarian government into changing course. Last week, 12 Latin American countries signed a resolution in Peru, condemning the Venezuelan government and backing its suspension from the region's Mercosur trading bloc.\n\n\"The government of Chile rejects the threat of a military intervention in Venezuela,\" tweeted Chile's foreign minister, Heraldo Mu\u00f1oz. He said that chancellors from many Latin American countries had agreed to reject any military steps.\n\nBolivian President Evo Morales, a Maduro ally, was quick to pounce on Trump's words. \"Now the world knows that those who were against Maduro were only looking for a military intervention from the empire,\" he tweeted.\n\nVicente Fox, a leading Trump critic and former president of Mexico, said on Twitter: \"Donald, get it together! Your mouth is quicker than your mind: Venezuela needs a way out, but NOT through violence. Take a dive into history, you're wrecking the U.S. don't wreck the world, just because you tweet faster than Maduro or Kim.\"\n\nAfter Trump's remarks, Reuters quoted a Defense Department spokesman as saying, \"the Pentagon has received no orders\" on Venezuela. So far, U.S. steps have involved freezing assets and issuing travel bans on a growing number of senior Venezuela officials, including Maduro. Trump administration officials are also still considering other severe actions, including targeting Venezuela's vital oil industry.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T02:23:00Z", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "source": {"uri": "tampabay.com", "title": "Tampa Bay Times", "id": "2249"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "02:23:00", "url": "http://www.tampabay.com/news/venezuela-uses-trump-threat-to-unite-region/2333577", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8863274", "image": "http://www.tampabay.com/resources/images/dti/rendered/2017/08/A4S_venezuela081317_19801995_8col.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "02:23:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

the Republican leader and had adopted a common, confrontational approach aimed at isolating President Nicolas Maduro's embattled government.\n\nWell before Maduro himself responded, governments in Latin America with a long memory of U.S. interventions were quick to express alarm over what sounded to them like saber-rattling. Even Colombia -- Washington's staunchest ally in the region -- condemned any \"military measures and the use of force\" that encroach on Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nMaduro has long accused Washington of having military designs on Venezuela and specifically its vast oil reserves, the world's largest. But those claims were dismissed by many as an attempt to distract from his government's failures to curb problems such as widespread shortages, spiraling inflation and one of the world's worst homicide rates.\n\n\"For years he's been saying the U.S. is preparing an invasion, and everyone laughed. But now the claim has been validated,\" said Mark Feierstein, who served as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe timing of Trump's remarks could not be worse, coming on the eve of a four-nation Latin America trip by Vice President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbor's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word -- dictatorship -- to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba -- a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum -- or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup. Only this time he can point to Trump's words as evidence.\n\nPence arrives in Colombia on Sunday to begin his Latin America tour, during which discussions on how to deal with Venezuela were expected to feature prominently. Instead he may now be forced to do damage control, said Christopher Sabatini, executive director of Global Americans, a website focused on U.S. policy in the region.\n\n\"He's about to get an earful,\" Sabatini said. \"The eagerness of Trump and some people around him to mouth off without any idea of context is really damaging not only to U.S. policy but also regional stability.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T06:49:00Z", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "source": {"uri": "japantimes.co.jp", "title": "The Japan Times", "id": "836"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:49:00", "url": "http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/08/13/world/politics-diplomacy-world/analysis-trumps-talk-military-intervention-venezuela-unnerves-latin-americans/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8881379", "image": "http://www.japantimes.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/f-venana-a-20170814.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "06:49:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Even Colombia  Washington's staunchest ally in the region  condemned any \"military measures and the use of force\" that encroach on Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nMaduro has long accused Washington of having military designs on Venezuela and specifically its vast oil reserves, the world's largest. But those claims were dismissed by many as an attempt to distract from his government's failures to curb problems such as widespread shortages, spiraling inflation and one of the world's worst homicide rates.\n\n\"For years he's been saying the U.S. is preparing an invasion, and everyone laughed. But now the claim has been validated,\" said Mark Feierstein, who served as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe timing of Trump's remarks could not be worse, coming on the eve of a four-nation Latin America trip by Vice President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbor's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word  dictatorship  to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba  a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum  or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup.

"id": "532783", "type": "person"}], "body": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Donald Trump's talk of a \"military option\" in Venezuela risks alienating Latin American nations that overcame their reluctance to work with the Republican leader and had adopted a common, confrontational approach aimed at isolating President Nicolas Maduro's embattled government.\n\nWell before Maduro himself responded, governments in Latin America with a long memory of U.S. interventions were quick to express alarm over what sounded to them like saber-rattling. Even Colombia -- Washington's staunchest ally in the region -- condemned any \"military measures and the use of force\" that encroach on Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nMaduro has long accused Washington of having military designs on Venezuela and specifically its vast oil reserves, the world's largest. But those claims were dismissed by many as an attempt to distract from his government's failures to curb problems such as widespread shortages, spiraling inflation and one of the world's worst homicide rates.\n\n\"For years he's been saying the U.S. is preparing an invasion, and everyone laughed. But now the claim has been validated,\" said Mark Feierstein, who served as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe timing of Trump's remarks could not be worse, coming on the eve of a four-nation Latin America trip by Vice President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbor's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word -- dictatorship -- to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba -- a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum -- or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup.

She is now president of the new all-powerful and pro-government Constituent Assembly created by a controversial vote last month that has been decried by opponents and foreign governments as fraudulent.\n\n\"Trump's is the gravest and most insolent threat ever voiced against the homeland of Bol\u00edvar,\" tweeted Communications Minister Ernesto Villegas.\n\nOn national television, Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez said: \"This is an act of craziness; it's an act of supreme extremism. There's an extremist elite governing the United States.\"\n\nTrump told journalists Friday: \"We are all over the world, and we have troops all over the world in places that are very far away. Venezuela is not very far away, and the people are suffering and they're dying. We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary.\"\n\nWith all branches of Venezuela's government and the armed forces now under his control, Maduro's biggest weakness appears to be the nation's crumbling economy and growing international isolation.\n\nYet Trump's threats about a \"military option\" appeared to be dividing U.S. allies in the region, risking the unity of Latin American nations that are seeking to pressure Venezuela's authoritarian government into changing course. Last week, 12 Latin American countries signed a resolution in Peru, condemning the Venezuelan government and backing its suspension from the region's Mercosur trading bloc.\n\n\"The government of Chile rejects the threat of a military intervention in Venezuela,\" tweeted Chile's foreign minister, Heraldo Mu\u00f1oz. He said that chancellors from many Latin American countries had agreed to reject any military steps.\n\nBolivian President Evo Morales, a Maduro ally, was quick to pounce on Trump's words.\n\n\"Now the world knows that those who were against Maduro were only looking for a military intervention from the empire,\" Morales tweeted.\n\nVicente Fox, the former president of Mexico, tweeted: \"Donald, get it together! Your mouth is quicker than your mind: Venezuela needs a way out, but NOT through violence. Take a dive into history, you're wrecking the U.S. don't wreck the world, just because you tweet faster than Maduro or Kim.\"\n\nSo far, U.S. steps have involved freezing assets and issuing travel bans on a growing number of senior Venezuela officials, including Maduro. The White House also is considering targeting Venezuela's vital oil industry.\n\nYet rather than applying pressure, observers said, claims such as Trump's largely serve to aid Maduro, allowing him to blame so-called American imperialism for Venezuela's economic spiral.\n\nFour months of anti-government street protests in Venezuela have left more than 100 people dead and thousands detained.\n\nMost leading opposition leaders have yet to respond to Trump's warning, which appears to put them in a bind. Should they refuse to back a foreign military option, they could lose the support of a small minority within the opposition that favors it. If they back Trump's threat, however, they risk being painted as traitors.\n\nAs recently as Thursday, Maduro - the anointed successor of leftist firebrand Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013 - said he wanted to have \"respectful\" relations with the United States. \"Mr. Trump, here's my hand,\" he said in a meeting with members of the new constituent assembly.\n\nAfter Trump's remarks on Friday, the White House's press secretary released a statement saying the president had rejected a request from Maduro for a phone call. \"Trump will gladly speak with the leader of Venezuela as soon as democracy is restored in that country,\" the statement read.\n\nShare\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nWant the news vital to Maine?

No! Here there is a Constituent People that has said that we want and we have a homeland and no one nor any empire will take that away from us. We are a people that is in political power in Venezuela, not one man!\"\n\nMaduro also made reference to the long history of the United States stained with violent intervention and violation of International Law and lack of respect for the sovereignty and self-determination of the world's nations and indicated that Trump's retrograde approach will no be tolerated.\n\n\"the 21st century is not a century of colonialism.

a Latin America tour Sunday that has taken on new significance following President Donald Trump's threat of a possible \"military option\" against Venezuela.\n\nThe weeklong trip, aimed at coordinating a regional diplomatic action to the political crisis in Caracas, begins in Colombia, a strong US ally that takes hundreds of millions of dollars a year in funding from Washington and which has little liking for leftist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe other stops were Argentina, Chile and Panama.\n\nThe tour would be dominated by the crisis in Venezuela and how US \"partners and friends\" were looking to the \"future\" regarding that country, while others were stuck in the \"past,\" a senior US administration official said.\n\n\"We've been firm in both word and deed against the Maduro regime, and it's important to get others in the region. And these four countries have, but we want to continue to put the pressure on the Maduro regime,\" he told reporters on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We'll talk to economic options, diplomatic options -- every tool that's available. It's not only the United States putting forth pressure on Maduro, but that he's getting it from all sides of the region as well.\"\n\nBut, thanks to Trump's warning on Friday that he was considering various measures to tackle Venezuela \"including a possible military option if necessary,\" Latin American nations -- including those who are scolding Caracas for \"breaking democratic rule\" -- are united against the use of American force.\n\nBrazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru all issued messages rejecting such a step.\n\n- Bitter memories -\n\nFor many Latin American countries, bitter memories of past US military adventures in the region have resurfaced as a result -- including the 1989 invasion of Panama to topple and capture its leader, Manuel Noriega -- as well as CIA involvement in bloody guerrilla and counter-guerrilla campaigns, and Washington's propping up of military dictators.\n\nThe United States has slapped sanctions on Maduro -- an extremely rare punishment against a head of state -- as well as two dozen of his officials.\n\nThe measures were for the establishment of a new assembly of Maduro loyalists that bypasses the legislature controlled by opposition. The body, which started work this month, has set about clamping down on dissent and opposition politicians.\n\nWith Trump's threat of possible military action, Maduro's regime has intensified arguments that the United States is plotting with the opposition to oust the president and grab Venezuela's oil reserves, the largest in the world.\n\nIt also said the threat was not just against it, but against all of Latin America.\n\n\"The reckless threat by President Donald Trump aims to drag Latin America and the Caribbean into a conflict that would permanently alter stability, peace and security in our region,\" Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told a news conference on Saturday.\n\nThe defense minister, General Vladimir Padrino, called Trump's talk \"craziness.\"\n\n- Force rejected -\n\nLeftist allies Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador and Nicaragua have backed Venezuela in a confrontation against its \"imperialist\" foe.\n\nOther Latin American nations strongly opposed to Venezuela's political move have also condemned the prospect of the US military being deployed to impose Washington's will.\n\n\"The repudiation of violence and whatever option involving the use of force is resolute and constitutes a fundamental basis of democratic cohabitation, both in domestic contexts as well as in international relations,\" Brazil's foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"The crisis in Venezuela can't be resolved through military actions, internally or externally,\" Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray wrote on Twitter.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T07:15:00Z", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "source": {"uri": "newindianexpress.com", "title": "The New Indian Express", "id": "934"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "07:15:00", "url": "http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/aug/13/mike-pence-latin-america-tour-clouded-by-donald-trump-threat-against-venezuela-1642635.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8883667", "image": "http://images.newindianexpress.com/uploads/user/imagelibrary/2017/8/13/w600X390/trump_and_pence.JPG", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "07:15:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Caracas said today, after its military vowed to stand up to the US leader's \"craziness.\"\n\nThe warning from Trump yesterday that his administration was mulling many options, \"including a possible military option if necessary,\" struck the government of Venezuela's beleaguered leftist president, Nicolas Maduro, like a thunderbolt.\n\nThe leadership of the crisis-wracked nation -- Latin America's biggest oil producer and an ally to Russia and Cuba -- suddenly found itself going from battling dissent, protests and growing international isolation to contemplating US military action last seen in the region in 1989, when American troops invaded Panama to topple its president, Manuel Noriega.\n\n\"The reckless threat by President Donald Trump aims to drag Latin America and the Caribbean into a conflict that would permanently alter stability, peace and security in our region,\" Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told a news conference, reading a statement in Maduro's name.\n\nThe menace, however, also gave Maduro's regime an unexpected opportunity to substantiate its daily refrain that it is a victim of a Washington plot to grab control of its oil reserves, the biggest in the world.\n\nThe military, current and retired members of which control a third of the government, leapt on the threat to say it was the nation's only bulwark against the \"imperialist aggression.\"\n\nGeneral Vladimir Padrino, Venezuela's defense minister and commander of its armed forces, yesterday called Trump's threat \"an act of craziness.\"\n\n\"I am certain that we will all be in the first ranks defending the interests and sovereignty of our beloved Venezuela,\" he said.\n\nTrump had said the military option was among a range of scenarios he was considering to fix the \"very dangerous mess\" in Venezuela.\n\nHe has already had his government impose sanctions on Maduro -- an extremely rare step against a head of state -- and two dozen of his officials.\n\nThey were for perceived moves towards a \"dictatorship\" in Venezuela, especially through Maduro's establishment this month of a new, all-powerful assembly filled with loyalists that has powers to override the country's legislature, controlled by the opposition.\n\nThe head of that new Constituent Assembly, Delcy Rodriguez, said on Twitter: \"We reject the cowardly, insolent and vile threats against the sacred sovereignty of Venezuela.\" The assembly was elected two weeks ago in a vote marred by allegations of fraud, an opposition boycott and violent protests and repression by security forces that brought the death toll in four months of unrest to more than 125.\n\nSince starting work, the assembly -- ostensibly tasked with rewriting the constitution -- has fired Venezuela's attorney general who had become a major critic of Maduro, and stepped up measures to quash opposition politicians.\n\nThe supreme court, which has also shown itself consistently loyal to Maduro, stripped two opposition mayors of the right to public office and ordered them to jail, bringing to 23 the number targeted by legal action.\n\nThe developments have prompted major Latin American nations Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru to slam Maduro's government for \"breaking democratic rule.\" Peru yesterday ordered Venezuela's ambassador to leave, with Caracas reacting by ordering out Lima's envoy.\n\nBut not all of Latin America is ranged against Maduro.\n\nVenezuela can still count on support from leftist allies Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua, as well as a handful of Caribbean nations that depend on it for cheap or free oil.\n\nThe prospect of US military action in a region that has very bitter memories of multiple such interventions last century has stirred unease even among countries opposed to Venezuela.\n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence will tomorrow begin a Latin American visit -- a trip seen as coordinating action between Washington and regional powers against Venezuela.\n\nBrazil yesterday said it and the other members of the South American trading bloc Mercosur -- from which Venezuela was suspended indefinitely days ago -- rejected the threat of force.\n\n\"The repudiation of violence and whatever option involving the use of force is resolute and constitutes a fundamental basis of democratic cohabitation, both in domestic contexts as well as in international relations,\" Brazil's foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)",

against Venezuela.\n\nThe weeklong trip, aimed at coordinating a regional diplomatic action to the political crisis in Caracas, begins in Colombia, a strong US ally that takes hundreds of millions of dollars a year in funding from Washington and which has little liking for leftist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe other stops were Argentina, Chile and Panama.\n\nThe tour would be dominated by the crisis in Venezuela and how US \"partners and friends\" were looking to the \"future\" regarding that country, while others were stuck in the \"past,\" a senior US administration official said.\n\n\"We've been firm in both word and deed against the Maduro regime, and it's important to get others in the region. And these four countries have, but we want to continue to put the pressure on the Maduro regime,\" he told reporters on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We'll talk to economic options, diplomatic options -- every tool that's available. It's not only the United States putting forth pressure on Maduro, but that he's getting it from all sides of the region as well.\"\n\nBut, thanks to Trump's warning on Friday that he was considering various measures to tackle Venezuela \"including a possible military option if necessary,\" Latin American nations -- including those who are scolding Caracas for \"breaking democratic rule\" -- are united against the use of American force.\n\nBrazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru all issued messages rejecting such a step.\n\n- Bitter memories -\n\nFor many Latin American countries, bitter memories of past US military adventures in the region have resurfaced as a result -- including the 1989 invasion of Panama to topple and capture its leader, Manuel Noriega -- as well as CIA involvement in bloody guerrilla and counter-guerrilla campaigns, and Washington's propping up of military dictators.\n\nThe United States has slapped sanctions on Maduro -- an extremely rare punishment against a head of state -- as well as two dozen of his officials.\n\nThe measures were for the establishment of a new assembly of Maduro loyalists that bypasses the legislature controlled by opposition. The body, which started work this month, has set about clamping down on dissent and opposition politicians.\n\nWith Trump's threat of possible military action, Maduro's regime has intensified arguments that the United States is plotting with the opposition to oust the president and grab Venezuela's oil reserves, the largest in the world.\n\nIt also said the threat was not just against it, but against all of Latin America.\n\n\"The reckless threat by President Donald Trump aims to drag Latin America and the Caribbean into a conflict that would permanently alter stability, peace and security in our region,\" Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told a news conference on Saturday.\n\nThe defense minister, General Vladimir Padrino, called Trump's talk \"craziness.\"\n\n- Force rejected -\n\nLeftist allies Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador and Nicaragua have backed Venezuela in a confrontation against its \"imperialist\" foe.\n\nOther Latin American nations strongly opposed to Venezuela's political move have also condemned the prospect of the US military being deployed to impose Washington's will.\n\n\"The repudiation of violence and whatever option involving the use of force is resolute and constitutes a fundamental basis of democratic cohabitation, both in domestic contexts as well as in international relations,\" Brazil's foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"The crisis in Venezuela can't be resolved through military actions, internally or externally,\" Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray wrote on Twitter.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T06:40:00Z", "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "title": "digitaljournal.com", "id": "556"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:40:00", "url": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/world/pence-latam-tour-clouded-by-trump-threat-against-venezuela/article/499878", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8880607", "image": "http://www.digitaljournal.com/img/1/0/4/8/0/9/3/i/3/5/2/p-large/0d9963e33641d93e4b7f2b6ca25594744305c13c.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "06:40:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

(Source: AP Photo) Pence to begin Latin America tour as global crises growDonald Trump to order investigation into Chinese trade practicesCharlottesville violence tests Donald Trump's presidential mettle\n\nUS President Donald Trump's talk of possible military action in Venezuela could be a political life-line for the country's unpopular leader, who has long used the threat of U.S. aggression to justify policies that have shredded the economy. President Nicolas Maduro has continued the free-spending socialist \"revolution\" started by his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, almost 20 years ago. Key to the populist rhetoric used by both is a constant drumbeat of warnings that the US \"empire\" is planning an invasion to steal Venezuela's oil.\n\nThat threat was laughed off by the opposition and until Friday night, when Trump said a military option was not out of the question for dealing with the Venezuelan government's crackdown on the opposition and deepening social crisis. \"He's doing Maduro a favor by reinforcing the nationalist position that the Gringos want to come and attack Venezuela. This has always been part of Maduro's rhetoric, and Chavez before him. And it has served them both well,\" said lawyer Luis Alberto Rodriguez while sitting at a cafe, smoking a Cuban cigar, in one of Caracas' wealthier neighborhoods.\n\n\"It's not going to have any impact other than the government using it to further unify its people and attack the opposition,\" the 44-year-old added.\n\nMaduro loyalists, who regularly insult opposition leaders as Washington's lackeys, wasted no time in pouncing.\n\n\"Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr. Trump!\" thundered Maduro's son, also named Nicolas, at the country's new constituent assembly, which was elected last month to re-write the constitution. The opposition fears the assembly will remove any checks that remain on the president's powers and critics globally have condemned it as an affront to democracy. \"If Venezuela were attacked,\" the younger Maduro said, \"The rifles would arrive in New York, Mr. Trump. We would take the White House.\" Marches against Maduro were held in Caracas on Saturday, with few confrontations with state security forces and no deaths. More than 120 have been killed in unrest since April, as the economy collapses deeper into a recession compounded by triple-digit inflation as well as food and medicine shortages.\n\nOpposition leaders who have counted on the US government to apply sustained moral and economic pressure on Maduro have so far been silent about Trump's remarks and marchers seemed confounded by his military threat. \"I don't know what to tell you,\" one woman marcher said, declining to give her name. \"It's very complicated.\"\n\n'NO GREATER GIFT'\n\nThe opposition, which controls a congress that has been neutered by Maduro's loyalist Supreme Court, boycotted last month's election of the new legislative superbody. Opposition leaders called instead for an early presidential election, which Maduro would likely lose as his popularity gets pummeled by the country's economic woes. \"Maduro could not have asked for a greater gift from Trump. He provided substance for Maduro's heretofore implausible conspiracy theories,\" said David Smilde, senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin American, a human rights think-tank.\n\nSmilde said Trump's threat of military force put the Venezuelan opposition \"on its heels\" after a group of Latin American governments joined last week in reprimanding Maduro for sponsoring the July 30 election of the constituent assembly.\n\n\"It has threatened to deflate the emerging regional consensus regarding Venezuela. Today the countries that on Tuesday signed on to a strong statement criticizing Maduro's authoritarian direction are spending their time criticizing Trump's statements,\" Smilde said.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: donald trump Venezuela", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-13", "textEnd": 49, "textStart": 34}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 3664, "textStart": 3657}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T11:51:00Z", "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "title": "The Indian Express", "id": "1155"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "11:51:00", "url": "http://indianexpress.com/article/world/donald-trumps-threat-of-military-action-in-venezuela-could-bolster-nicolas-maduro-4795053/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8910325", "image": "http://images.indianexpress.com/2017/08/pence1.jpg?w=759", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "11:51:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

tour Sunday (Aug 13) that has taken on new significance following President Donald Trump's threat of a possible \"military option\" against Venezuela.\n\nThe weeklong trip, aimed at coordinating a regional diplomatic action to the political crisis in Caracas, begins in Colombia, a strong US ally that takes hundreds of millions of dollars a year in funding from Washington and which has little liking for leftist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThe other stops were Argentina, Chile and Panama.\n\nThe tour would be dominated by the crisis in Venezuela and how US \"partners and friends\" were looking to the \"future\" regarding that country, while others were stuck in the \"past\", a senior US administration official said.\n\nGet The Straits Times\n\nnewsletters in your

And these four countries have, but we want to continue to put the pressure on the Maduro regime,\" he told reporters on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"We'll talk to economic options, diplomatic options - every tool that's available. It's not only the United States putting forth pressure on Maduro, but that he's getting it from all sides of the region as well.\"\n\nBut, thanks to Trump's warning on Friday that he was considering various measures to tackle Venezuela \"including a possible military option if necessary\", Latin American nations - including those who are scolding Caracas for \"breaking democratic rule\" - are united against the use of American force.\n\nBrazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru all issued messages rejecting such a step.\n\nBITTER MEMORIES\n\nFor many Latin American countries, bitter memories of past US military adventures in the region have resurfaced as a result - including the 1989 invasion of Panama to topple and capture its leader, Manuel Noriega - as well as CIA involvement in bloody guerrilla and counter-guerrilla campaigns, and Washington's propping up of military dictators.\n\nThe United States has slapped sanctions on Maduro - an extremely rare punishment against a head of state - as well as two dozen of his officials.\n\nThe measures were for the establishment of a new assembly of Maduro loyalists that bypasses the legislature controlled by opposition. The body, which started work this month, has set about clamping down on dissent and opposition politicians.\n\nWith Trump's threat of possible military action, Maduro's regime has intensified arguments that the United States is plotting with the opposition to oust the president and grab Venezuela's oil reserves, the largest in the world.\n\nIt also said the threat was not just against it, but against all of Latin America.\n\n\"The reckless threat by President Donald Trump aims to drag Latin America and the Caribbean into a conflict that would permanently alter stability, peace and security in our region,\" Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told a news conference on Saturday.\n\nThe defense minister, General Vladimir Padrino, called Trump's talk \"craziness\".\n\nFORCE REJECTED\n\nLeftist allies Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador and Nicaragua have backed Venezuela in a confrontation against its \"imperialist\" foe.\n\nOther Latin American nations strongly opposed to Venezuela's political move have also condemned the prospect of the US military being deployed to impose Washington's will.\n\n\"The repudiation of violence and whatever option involving the use of force is resolute and constitutes a fundamental basis of democratic cohabitation, both in domestic contexts as well as in international relations,\" Brazil's foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"The crisis in Venezuela can't be resolved through military actions, internally or externally,\" Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray wrote on Twitter.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-13", "textEnd": 99, "textStart": 93}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T07:54:00Z", "sim": 0.5960784554481506, "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "title": "The Straits Times", "id": "611"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "07:54:00", "url": "http://www.straitstimes.com/world/americas/pences-latin-america-tour-clouded-by-trump-threat-against-venezuela", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8887017", "image": "http://www.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/x_large/public/articles/2017/08/13/fa-pence-13081.jpg?itok=Ag6X0eGB", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "07:54:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

The U.S. accuses Maduro's regime of violating human rights and subverting democratic processes. Most recently, on Wednesday the US sanctioned the brother of deceased former leader Hugo Chavez - Adan, who was appointed secretary of Venezuela's new \"all powerful\" constituent assembly.\n\nSeparately, Trump also said he would will speak with China's Xi Jinping tonight, adding that \"we're considering additional sanctions at a very, very high level\" on North Korea. The president also said that \"nobody loves a peaceful solution\" more than he does, but warned that \"bad things could come.\"\n\nAsked by reporters to clarify what bad things and if he meant war, Trump says \"I think you know the answer to that.\"\n\nSo, instead of just one offensive war, Trump appears set to launch two, which is probably not surprising: back in early April when Trump unleashed the military strike against Assad, it didn't achieve anything but at least it pushed the Russian collusion narrative away from the front pages for a few weeks. With the president increasingly concerned about Mueller's sniffing around, Trump may as well double down.\n\nAnd with markets now having not one but two potential warzones to keep an eye on, Sunday afternoon futures activity could get interesting, while the reaction esponse in the price of oil to a threat of war in the country with the largest petroleum reserves in the world would seem obvious: up.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 900, "textStart": 885}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-11T23:34:00Z", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "source": {"uri": "fromthetrenchesworldreport.com", "title": "From the Trenches World Report", "id": "17200"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "23:34:00", "url": "http://fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/trump-military-option-venezuela/204974", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8719303", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "time": "23:34:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-11"}

reluctance to work with the Republican leader and had adopted a common, confrontational approach aimed at isolating President Nicolas Maduro's embattled government.\n\nWell before Maduro himself responded, governments in Latin America with a long memory of U.S. interventions were quick to express alarm over what sounded to them like saber-rattling. Even Colombia - Washington's staunchest ally in the region - condemned any \"military measures and the use of force\" that encroach on Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nMaduro has long accused Washington of having military designs on Venezuela and specifically its vast oil reserves, the world's largest. But those claims were dismissed by many as an attempt to distract from his government's failures to curb problems such as widespread shortages, spiraling inflation and one of the world's worst homicide rates.\n\n\"For years he's been saying the U.S. is preparing an invasion, and everyone laughed. But now the claim has been validated,\" said Mark Feierstein, who served as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe timing of Trump's remarks could not be worse, coming on the eve of a four-nation Latin America trip by Vice President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbor's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word - dictatorship - to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba - a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum - or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup. Only this time he can point to Trump's words as evidence.\n\nPence arrives in Colombia on Sunday to begin his Latin America tour, during which discussions on how to deal with Venezuela were expected to feature prominently.

President Donald Trump's talk of a \"military option\" in Venezuela risks alienating Latin American nations that overcame their reluctance to work with the Republican leader and had adopted a common, confrontational approach aimed at isolating President Nicolas Maduro's embattled government.\n\nWell before Maduro himself responded, governments in Latin America with a long memory of U.S. interventions were quick to express alarm over what sounded to them like saber-rattling. Even Colombia -- Washington's staunchest ally in the region -- condemned any \"military measures and the use of force\" that encroach on Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nMaduro has long accused Washington of having military designs on Venezuela and specifically its vast oil reserves, the world's largest. But those claims were dismissed by many as an attempt to distract from his government's failures to curb problems such as widespread shortages, spiraling inflation and one of the world's worst homicide rates.\n\n\"For years he's been saying the U.S. is preparing an invasion, and everyone laughed. But now the claim has been validated,\" said Mark Feierstein, who served as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe timing of Trump's remarks could not be worse, coming on the eve of a four-nation Latin America trip by Vice-President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbour's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word -- dictatorship -- to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba -- a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum -- or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup. Only this time he can point to Trump's words as evidence.\n\nPence arrives in Colombia on Sunday to begin his Latin America tour, during which discussions on how to deal with Venezuela were expected to feature prominently. Instead he may now be forced to do damage control, said Christopher Sabatini, executive director of Global Americans, a website focused on U.S. policy in the region.\n\n\"He's about to get an earful,\" Sabatini said. \"The eagerness of Trump and some people around him to mouth off without any idea of context is really damaging not only to U.S. policy but also regional stability.\n\n___\n\nFollow Joshua Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T20:33:00Z", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "source": {"uri": "mymcmurray.com", "title": "MyMcMurray", "id": "1171"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:33:00", "url": "http://www.mymcmurray.com/2017/08/12/analysis-trump-military-talk-on-venezuela-unnerves-latam/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8840876", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "20:33:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Friday he was considering various measures to tackle Venezuela \"including a possible military option if necessary\".\n\nVenezuela's defence minister Vladimir Padrino said Mr Trump's comments were \"an act of craziness\".\n\nThe country has been ravaged by protests against President Nicolas Maduro and his new constituent assembly, which can rewrite the constitution and override parliament.\n\nDemonstrations have been taking place since April and have turned increasingly violent with more than 120 people killed.\n\nMexico, Colombia, Peru and Brazil have condemned the president's comments and Mr Maduro's son has also weighed in as a newly elected assembly member said rifles would \"arrive and take the White House\" if military action was launched in Venezuela.\n\nNicolas Maduro Guerra said Mr Trump needed to concentrate on his own country's problems and vowed that if the US attacked Venezuela, the Vietnam War \"would seem small in comparison\".\n\nRicardo Luna, foreign minister of Peru, which has been a fierce critic of Mr Maduro, said: \"All foreign or domestic threats to resort to force undermine the goal of reinstating democratic governance in Venezuela, as well as the principles enshrined in the UN charter.\"\n\nIn a statement, Brazil's foreign ministry said: \"The repudiation of violence and whatever option involving the use of force is resolute and constitutes a fundamental basis of democratic cohabitation, both in domestic contexts as well as in international relations.\"\n\nMexico foreign minister Luis Videgaray wrote on Twitter. \"The crisis in Venezuela can't be resolved through military actions, internally or externally.\"\n\nMany Latin countries have bitter memories of past military interventions in the region, including the 1989 invasion of Panama to topple leader Manuel Noriega.\n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence is currently touring Latin America with the aim of co-ordinating regional diplomatic action to end the crisis in Caracas\n\nA senior US administration official said the tour would involve discussions on how US \"partners and friends\" were looking to the \"future\" regarding that country, while others were stuck in the \"past\".\n\nHe added: \"We'll talk to economic options, diplomatic options - every tool that's available.

reluctance to work with the Republican leader and had adopted a common, confrontational approach aimed at isolating President Nicolas Maduro's embattled government.\n\nWell before Maduro himself responded, governments in Latin America with a long memory of U.S. interventions were quick to express alarm over what sounded to them like saber-rattling. Even Colombia -- Washington's staunchest ally in the region -- condemned any \"military measures and the use of force\" that encroach on Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nMaduro has long accused Washington of having military designs on Venezuela and specifically its vast oil reserves, the world's largest. But those claims were dismissed by many as an attempt to distract from his government's failures to curb problems such as widespread shortages, spiraling inflation and one of the world's worst homicide rates.\n\n\"For years he's been saying the U.S. is preparing an invasion, and everyone laughed. But now the claim has been validated,\" said Mark Feierstein, who served as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe timing of Trump's remarks could not be worse, coming on the eve of a four-nation Latin America trip by Vice President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbor's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word -- dictatorship -- to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba -- a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum -- or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup. Only this time he can point to Trump's words as evidence.\n\nPence arrives in Colombia on Sunday to begin his Latin America tour, during which discussions on how to deal with Venezuela were expected to feature prominently. Instead he may now be forced to do damage control, said Christopher Sabatini, executive director of Global Americans, a website focused on U.S. policy in the region.\n\n\"He's about to get an earful,\" Sabatini said. \"The eagerness of Trump and some people around him to mouth off without any idea of context is really damaging not only to U.S. policy but also regional stability.\n\n___\n\nFollow Joshua Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

McMaster. \"And by the way, I'm not going to rule out a military option.\"\n\nIt was unclear how seriously to take the threat, given Trump's propensity to speak off the cuff and the casual nature of the statement. He often says he does not like to take any options of the table because he believes it keeps adversaries off balance.\n\nBut his declaration nonetheless raised concerns of further insecurity at a moment when many around the globe, including allies, are questioning America's ability to continue providing a stable source of world leadership.\n\nThe suggestion that Trump would initiate a military operation in Venezuela -- something that no one in the intelligence or diplomatic communities have suggested -- awakened old ghosts of U.S. intervention in Latin America, and will do little to preserve the hemispheric unity that Washington had until now mustered in opposition to the abuses of the government of President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nQuestions over how seriously to take the threat underscore the unusual nature of the Trump presidency. Normally, such a declaration by a United States president would spark extended debate and command the world's full attention.\n\n\"This is not reality TV,\" Leon Panetta, formerly both secretary of defense and director of the Central Intelligence Agency, told CNN.\n\nThe Trump administration has already imposed new economic sanctions this month against Venezuela, and Maduro, following an election that solidified the authoritarian leader's grip on the South American country's government.\n\nTrump was elected to office as a fierce opponent of international intervention, frequently criticizing the Iraq war. But this week alone, he has threatened two regimes with military action, Venezuela and Iraq.\n\nLatest updates Copyright \u00a9 2017, Los Angeles Times", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-11", "textEnd": 77, "textStart": 64, "freq": 2}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T00:01:00Z", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "title": "Los Angeles Times", "id": "971"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "00:01:00", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-trump-not-going-to-rule-out-military-1502493650-htmlstory.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8721863", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-598e4414/turbine/la-na-essential-washington-updates-trump-not-going-to-rule-out-military-1502493650", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "00:01:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Trump added that Washington is considering several options to intervene in Venezuela, one of them being military action should its need arise.\n\nDelcy Rodr\u00edguez, rejected threats of the United States to attack Venezuela militarily and reasserted the support of Venezuelan people to President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nHis remarks are the first by a high-level Venezuelan official and come ahead of an expected statement by Maduro's government.\n\nLate Friday, the White House announced that Maduro had requested a phone call with Trump that day and that Trump had turned him down, saying that he will not speak to the leader until \"democracy is restored in that country\".\n\nIt's unclear if Trump would even have the constitutional authority to send troops to the South American country without congressional approval.\n\nOn July 31 the United States imposed legal and financial sanctions against the Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, describing as a \"dictator\".\n\nThe political crisis in Venezuela appears to grow more volatile. Maduro and former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez have long argued that the US has been trying to undermine them and want to force a coup in the country.\n\nTrump said Friday that he had not ruled out possible military action in Venezuela in response to growing political and social turmoil in the country.\n\nSome experts say that Trump's aggressive comments could work in Maduro's favor, helping the leader to boost his standing as Venezuela's defender.\n\nBen Sasse, a senator from Nebraska and a member of the Senate Armed Service Committee, criticized the new position of the President on the Venezuelan crisis.\n\nThe power struggle between the government and the opposition has led to months of violent confrontations that have left more than 100 people dead, including protesters, government supporters and security forces.\n\nVenezuela is in a state of turmoil as Maduro's party moves to strengthen its grip on power. \"Here I am\", he reportedly said during a speech at the constituent assembly, a new body that was elected amid worldwide condemnation and allegations of electoral fraud late last month.\n\nRelated News: 13 August 2017 Watch Out for Fake Eclipse Glasses 13 August 2017 Detroit Tigers vs. Minnesota Twins 13 August 2017 Trump warns North Korea against making 'overt' threats 13 August 2017 Tillerson asks Barzani to postpone KRG independence referendum 13 August 2017 FBI 'Most Wanted' fugitive arrested in Woodbridge after public tips Philip Morris International Inc (PM) Stake Reduced by Grimes & Company Inc STARWOOD PROPERTY TRUST, INC.

"id": "532783", "type": "person"}], "body": "CARACAS, Venezuela -- President Donald Trump's talk of a \"military option\" in Venezuela risks alienating Latin American nations that overcame their reluctance to work with the Republican leader and had adopted a common, confrontational approach aimed at isolating President Nicolas Maduro's embattled government.\n\nWell before Maduro himself responded, governments in Latin America with a long memory of U.S. interventions were quick to express alarm over what sounded to them like saber-rattling. Even Colombia -- Washington's staunchest ally in the region -- condemned any \"military measures and the use of force\" that encroach on Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nMaduro has long accused Washington of having military designs on Venezuela and specifically its vast oil reserves, the world's largest. But those claims were dismissed by many as an attempt to distract from his government's failures to curb problems such as widespread shortages, spiraling inflation and one of the world's worst homicide rates.\n\n\"For years he's been saying the U.S. is preparing an invasion, and everyone laughed. But now the claim has been validated,\" said Mark Feierstein, who served as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe timing of Trump's remarks could not be worse, coming on the eve of a four-nation Latin America trip by Vice President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbor's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word -- dictatorship -- to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba -- a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum -- or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup. Only this time he can point to Trump's words as evidence.\n\nPence arrives in Colombia on Sunday to begin his Latin America tour, during which discussions on how to deal with Venezuela were expected to feature prominently. Instead he may now be forced to do damage control, said Christopher Sabatini, executive director of Global Americans, a website focused on U.S. policy in the region.\n\n\"He's about to get an earful,\" Sabatini said. \"The eagerness of Trump and some people around him to mouth off without any idea of context is really damaging not only to U.S. policy but also regional stability.\n\n___\n\nFollow Joshua Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T20:06:00Z", "sim": 0.5803921818733215, "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "title": "WRAL.com", "id": "18458"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:06:00", "url": "http://www.wral.com/analysis-trump-military-talk-on-venezuela-unnerves-latam/16876113/", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8838330", "image": "https://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/news/political/2017/08/12/16876113/media_ca1ea4a9b1954a3aaf22e8002d180a41-DMID1-5bqp3kczt-540x360.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "20:06:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

interventions were quick to express alarm over what sounded to them like saber-rattling. Even Colombia -- Washington's staunchest ally in the region -- condemned any \"military measures and the use of force\" that encroach on Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nMaduro has long accused Washington of having military designs on Venezuela and specifically its vast oil reserves, the world's largest. But those claims were dismissed by many as an attempt to distract from his government's failures to curb problems such as widespread shortages, spiraling inflation and one of the world's worst homicide rates.\n\n\"For years he's been saying the U.S. is preparing an invasion, and everyone laughed. But now the claim has been validated,\" said Mark Feierstein, who served as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe timing of Trump's remarks could not be worse, coming on the eve of a four-nation Latin America trip by Vice President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbor's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word -- dictatorship -- to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba -- a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum -- or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup. Only this time he can point to Trump's words as evidence.\n\nPence arrives in Colombia on Sunday to begin his Latin America tour, during which discussions on how to deal with Venezuela were expected to feature prominently. Instead he may now be forced to do damage control, said Christopher Sabatini, executive director of Global Americans, a website focused on U.S. policy in the region.\n\n\"He's about to get an earful,\" Sabatini said. \"The eagerness of Trump and some people around him to mouth off without any idea of context is really damaging not only to U.S. policy but also regional stability.\n\n___\n\nFollow Joshua Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T18:41:00Z", "sim": 0.5764706134796143, "source": {"uri": "sfchronicle.com", "title": "San Francisco Chronicle", "id": "2142"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:06:00", "url": "http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/politics/article/Analysis-Trump-military-talk-on-Venezuela-11795135.php", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8877785", "image": "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/64/26/52/13724347/3/rawImage.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "18:41:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

the U.S. could take military action against Venezuela and President Nicolas Maduro's power grab.\n\nSpeaking at his New Jersey golf course Friday, Trump said he would not \"rule out\" a military option . . . it's certainly something that we could pursue.\"\n\nTrump has been blasting Maduro's moves to consolidate power, describing him as a \"dictator.\" Maduro and former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez have long argued that the U.S. has been trying to undermine them and want to force a coup in the country.\n\nThe Trump administration has issued a series of sanctions against Maduro and more than two dozen current and former Venezuelan officials.\n\nBut a military intervention would be an extraordinary escalation in response.\n\nReuters reported Friday that the Pentagon said the White House hadn't given it any orders on Venezuela.\n\nTrump's threats followed a move by Maduro to solidify his power by holding a disputed election on July 30 to create a new national assembly that sidesteps the opposition-controlled Congress.\n\nThe vote was widely condemned by the United States and other countries as a fraudulent effort to thwart the will of most Venezuelans and transform the country from a democracy to a socialist dictatorship like Cuba.\n\nAlthough Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves, its economy is collapsing because of mismanagement by Maduro's government that has caused shortages of basic consumer products and sent inflation soaring.\n\nDozens of people have been killed by Venezuelan troops during months of political protests against the government.\n\nMaduro has tried to rally public support by accusing the United States of trying to organize a coup to oust him, an allegation he likely will reassert in the wake of Trump's comments.\n\nTrump's comments on Venezuela come amid rising tensions over U.S. relations with North Korea, which has threatened a missile launch toward the U.S. territory of Guam over what it perceives as Trump's aggressive posturing.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\n5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2wQLjnW", "extractedDates": [{"amb":

the Republican leader and had adopted a common, confrontational approach aimed at isolating President Nicolas Maduro's embattled government.\n\nWell before Maduro himself responded, governments in Latin America with a long memory of U.S. interventions were quick to express alarm over what sounded to them like saber-rattling. Even Colombia -- Washington's staunchest ally in the region -- condemned any \"military measures and the use of force\" that encroach on Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nMaduro has long accused Washington of having military designs on Venezuela and specifically its vast oil reserves, the world's largest. But those claims were dismissed by many as an attempt to distract from his government's failures to curb problems such as widespread shortages, spiraling inflation and one of the world's worst homicide rates.\n\n\"For years he's been saying the U.S. is preparing an invasion, and everyone laughed. But now the claim has been validated,\" said Mark Feierstein, who served as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nThe timing of Trump's remarks could not be worse, coming on the eve of a four-nation Latin America trip by Vice President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbor's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word -- dictatorship -- to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nHouse minibus sets stage for fight over sequestration, civilian-defense parity\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba -- a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum -- or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup.

interventions were quick to express alarm over what sounded to them like saber-rattling. Even Colombia -- Washington's staunchest ally in the region -- condemned any \"military measures and the use of force\" that encroach on Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nMaduro has long accused Washington of having military designs on Venezuela and specifically its vast oil reserves, the world's largest. But those claims were dismissed by many as an attempt to distract from his government's failures to curb problems such as widespread shortages, spiraling inflation and one of the world's worst homicide rates.\n\n\"For years he's been saying the U.S. is preparing an invasion, and everyone laughed. But now the claim has been validated,\" said Mark Feierstein, who served as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe timing of Trump's remarks could not be worse, coming on the eve of a four-nation Latin America trip by Vice President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbor's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word -- dictatorship -- to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba -- a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum -- or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup. Only this time he can point to Trump's words as evidence.\n\nPence arrives in Colombia on Sunday to begin his Latin America tour, during which discussions on how to deal with Venezuela were expected to feature prominently.

reluctance to work with the Republican leader and had adopted a common, confrontational approach aimed at isolating President Nicolas Maduro's embattled government.\n\nWell before Maduro himself responded, governments in Latin America with a long memory of U.S. interventions were quick to express alarm over what sounded to them like saber-rattling. Even Colombia - Washington's staunchest ally in the region - condemned any \"military measures and the use of force\" that encroach on Venezuela's sovereignty.\n\nMaduro has long accused Washington of having military designs on Venezuela and specifically its vast oil reserves, the world's largest. But those claims were dismissed by many as an attempt to distract from his government's failures to curb problems such as widespread shortages, spiraling inflation and one of the world's worst homicide rates.\n\n\"For years he's been saying the U.S. is preparing an invasion, and everyone laughed. But now the claim has been validated,\" said Mark Feierstein, who served as President Barack Obama's top national security adviser on Latin America. \"It's hard to imagine a more damaging thing for Trump to say.\"\n\nThe timing of Trump's remarks could not be worse, coming on the eve of a four-nation Latin America trip by Vice President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbor's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word - dictatorship - to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba - a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum - or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup. Only this time he can point to Trump's words as evidence.\n\nPence arrives in Colombia on Sunday to begin his Latin America tour, during which discussions on how to deal with Venezuela were expected to feature prominently. Instead he may now be forced to do damage control, said Christopher Sabatini, executive director of Global Americans, a website focused on U.S. policy in the region.\n\n\"He's about to get an earful,\" Sabatini said. \"The eagerness of Trump and some people around him to mouth off without any idea of context is really damaging not only to U.S. policy but also regional stability.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T19:40:00Z", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "title": "Associated Press", "id": "963"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "19:46:00", "url": "http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/L/LT_VENEZUELA_TRUMP_ANALYSIS?SITE=CAANR&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8836395", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "19:40:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

being the region's whipping boy, Venezuela on Saturday saw some of its most ardent foes (reluctantly) coming to its defense -- pushing back against Trump's threat to use military force to deal with the socialist administration in Caracas.\n\nColombia, Peru and the Mercosur bloc of nations -- three of Venezuela's biggest and perhaps most effective detractors in the region -- were just some of those who issued statements denouncing Trump's bellicose rhetoric.\n\nRead More: Trump was making friends in Latin America, until...\n\nColombia's Foreign Ministry on Saturday issued a statement saying it rejected the use of \"military measures and the use of force\" when dealing with Venezuela.\n\n\"Despite the current difficulties of reaching a peaceful and negotiated solution, we still believe that is the right path to find long-term solutions for the people of Venezuela,\" the ministry said.\n\nThe rebuke, albeit mild, from Washington's most loyal ally in the region came the day before Vice President Mike Pence will be kicking off a Central and South American tour here.\n\nAlso Saturday, Peru said \"any attempted use of force, whether it's external or internal, undermines the objective of restoring democracy ... to Venezuela.\"\n\nJust a few days earlier, Peru had hosted officials from 17 Latin American nations who condemned Venezuela's abuse of power and loss of democracy.\n\nAnd a week ago, the Mercosur bloc of nations -- led by Argentina, Brazil and Chile -- indefinitely suspended Venezuela from the group, urging the country to release political prisoners and return to democracy.\n\nBut on Saturday the bloc was condemning Washington's saber rattling.\n\nRead More: Venezuela's opposition stressed by election decision\n\nThe reactions come after Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf club on Friday that \"we have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary.\"\n\nTrump's comments have been downplayed by the State Department and Pentagon, but have drawn the ire of a region that has always been sensitive to Washington meddling and CIA-backed coups.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine a worse time for Trump to make this threat,\" David Smilde, a senior fellow with the Washington Office on Latin America, said in a statement. \"Venezuela's government has routinely used the specter of U.S. aggression as a justification for actions that violate democratic principles, and this remark will only reinforce their ant-imperialist rhetoric.\"\n\nJose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director for Human Rights Watch, wrote on Twitter that \"no one has helped Maduro as much as Trump [with] this nonsense he said [Friday].\"\n\nMaduro's socialist administration has been under siege at home and abroad as more than four months of anti-government protests have left more than 120 dead. And the regime's use of excessive force and mass detentions had repulsed all but its staunchest allies in the region.\n\nRead More: Why are Venezuelans scared of the dark?\n\nOn Saturday, Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza called on the nation and the region to rally to the country's defense, and said Trump's statements were \"the most aggressive imperial act of the United States\" in more than a century.\n\n\"The terrible threats of President Donald Trump are trying to drag Latin America and the Caribbean into a conflict that could permanently alter the stability, peace and security in our region,\" he said.\n\nOn Aug. 4, Venezuela raised alarms in the region when it installed a National Constituent Assembly, a body with all-encompassing powers that will rewrite the constitution.\n\nOn Saturday, demonstrators took to the streets once again to protest the new entity, which they see as a power grab, and the arrest of several opposition mayors.\n\nTensions are running high in Venezuela. On Friday, the government announced that it had captured former National Guard Capt. Juan Carlos Caguaripano, who is accused of leading an Aug. 6 raid on a military base. Also this week, ruling party hard-liner Diosdado Cabello announced that a Venezuelan employee of the U.S. Embassy in Caracas had been detained for asking questions about Cabello's whereabouts.\n\nThe U.S. State Department would not confirm that, el Nuevo Herald reported.\n\nMaduro seemed to be enjoying his twist of fate, retweeting messages from longtime critics, including former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who routinely calls Maduro a dictator and tyrant.\n\n\"Only an imbecile would wage war on his neighbor,\" Fox told Trump in a tweet. \"Violence [is] not the answer.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-04", "textEnd": 3479, "textStart": 3473}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-06", "textEnd": 3991, "textStart": 3985}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T18:37:00Z", "sim": 0.5607843399047852, "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "title": "Miami Herald", "id": "283"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:28:00", "url": "http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article166913722.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8867155", "image": "http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/pp2lrn/picture166913712/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Venezuela%20Political%20Crisis", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "18:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

(Reuters/File) Venezuela assembly denounces 'vile threats' from Donald TrumpLiberal activists look to ballot box rather than impeachmentVenezuela defense chief Vladimir Padrino calls Donald Trump's intervention threat 'crazy'\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's talk of possible military action in Venezuela could be a political life-line for the country's unpopular leader, who has long used the threat of U.S. aggression to justify policies that have shredded the economy. President Nicolas Maduro has continued the free-spending socialist \"revolution\" started by his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, almost 20 years ago.\n\nKey to the populist rhetoric used by both is a constant drumbeat of warnings that the U.S. \"empire\" is planning an invasion to steal Venezuela's oil. That threat was laughed off by the opposition and until Friday night, when Trump said a military option was not out of the question for dealing with the Venezuelan government's crackdown on the opposition and deepening social crisis.\n\n\"He's doing Maduro a favor by reinforcing the nationalist position that the Gringos want to come and attack Venezuela. This has always been part of Maduro's rhetoric, and Chavez before him. And it has served them both well,\" said lawyer Luis Alberto Rodriguez while sitting at a cafe, smoking a Cuban cigar, in one of Caracas' wealthier neighborhoods.\n\n\"It's not going to have any impact other than the government using it to further unify its people and attack the opposition,\" the 44-year-old added. Maduro loyalists, who regularly insult opposition leaders as Washington's lackeys, wasted no time in pouncing. \"Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr. Trump!\" thundered Maduro's son, also named Nicolas, at the country's new constituent assembly, which was elected last month to re-write the constitution.\n\nThe opposition fears the assembly will remove any checks that remain on the president's powers and critics globally have condemned it as an affront to democracy. \"If Venezuela were attacked,\" the younger Maduro said, \"The rifles would arrive in New York, Mr. Trump. We would take the White House.\" Marches against Maduro were held in Caracas on Saturday, with few confrontations with state security forces and no deaths.\n\nMore than 120 have been killed in unrest since April, as the economy collapses deeper into a recession compounded by triple-digit inflation as well as food and medicine shortages. Opposition leaders who have counted on the U.S. government to apply sustained moral and economic pressure on Maduro have so far been silent about Trump's remarks and marchers seemed confounded by his military threat.\n\n\"I don't know what to tell you,\" one woman marcher said, declining to give her name. \"It's very complicated.\"\n\n'NO GREATER GIFT'\n\nThe opposition, which controls a congress that has been neutered by Maduro's loyalist Supreme Court, boycotted last month's election of the new legislative superbody. Opposition leaders called instead for an early presidential election, which Maduro would likely lose as his popularity gets pummeled by the country's economic woes. \"Maduro could not have asked for a greater gift from Trump. He provided substance for Maduro's heretofore implausible conspiracy theories,\" said David Smilde, senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin American, a human rights think-tank.\n\nSmilde said Trump's threat of military force put the Venezuelan opposition \"on its heels\" after a group of Latin American governments joined last week in reprimanding Maduro for sponsoring the July 30 election of the constituent assembly. \"It has threatened to deflate the emerging regional consensus regarding Venezuela.

And it has served them both well,' said lawyer Luis Alberto Rodriguez while sitting at a cafe, smoking a Cuban cigar, in one of Caracas' wealthier neighbourhoods.\n\n'It's not going to have any impact other than the government using it to further unify its people and attack the opposition,' the 44-year-old added.\n\nMaduro loyalists, who regularly insult opposition leaders as Washington's lackeys, wasted no time in pouncing.\n\n'Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr. Trump!' thundered Maduro's son, also named Nicolas, at the country's new constituent assembly, which was elected last month to re-write the constitution.\n\nThe opposition fears the assembly will remove any checks that remain on the president's powers and critics globally have condemned it as an affront to democracy.\n\n'If Venezuela were attacked,' the younger Maduro said, 'The rifles would arrive in New York, Mr. Trump. We would take the White House.'\n\nMarches against Maduro were held in Caracas on Saturday, with few confrontations with state security forces and no deaths. More than 120 have been killed in unrest since April, as the economy collapses deeper into a recession compounded by triple-digit inflation as well as food and medicine shortages.\n\nOpposition leaders who have counted on the US government to apply sustained moral and economic pressure on Maduro have so far been silent about Trump's remarks and marchers seemed confounded by his military threat.\n\n'I don't know what to tell you,' one woman marcher said, declining to give her name. 'It's very complicated.'\n\nThe opposition, which controls a congress that has been neutered by Maduro's loyalist Supreme Court, boycotted last month's election of the new legislative superbody.\n\nOpposition leaders called instead for an early presidential election, which Maduro would likely lose as his popularity gets pummelled by the country's economic woes.\n\n'Maduro could not have asked for a greater gift from Trump. He provided substance for Maduro's heretofore implausible conspiracy theories,' said David Smilde, senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin American, a human rights think-tank.\n\nSmilde said Trump's threat of military force put the Venezuelan opposition 'on its heels' after a group of Latin American governments joined last week in reprimanding Maduro for sponsoring the July 30 election of the constituent assembly.\n\n'It has threatened to deflate the emerging regional consensus regarding Venezuela. Today the countries that on Tuesday signed on to a strong statement criticizing Maduro's authoritarian direction are spending their time criticizing Trump's statements,' Smilde said.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 3317, "textStart": 3310}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T09:53:00Z", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "source": {"uri": "christiantoday.com", "title": "christiantoday.com", "id": "1083"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:53:00", "url": "https://www.christiantoday.com/article/venezuela.crisis.how.donald.trump.is.making.a.bad.situation.worse/111819.htm", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8898367", "image": "https://ctd-thechristianpost.netdna-ssl.com/en/full/63418/maduro.png", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "09:53:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

But before turning to threats of military force, the Trump administration should target one of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's greatest economic vulnerabilities: Venezuela's debts.\n\nOver the last few weeks, the Trump administration has imposed targeted financial sanctions on Maduro and several of his key allies. These sanctions, however, have likely imposed few real-world costs on Maduro, who probably liquidated any assets he owned in the U.S. well before the sanctions hit.\n\nInstead, the Trump administration should target the more than $100 billion that Venezuela and its state-owned oil company, PDVSA, owe in outstanding public debt, much of it issued under U.S. law. Venezuela has continued to sell debt to U.S. investors even as the political situation has deteriorated in recent months.\n\nFor example, in May of this year Goldman Sachs purchased $2.8 billion in Venezuelan debt. Venezuela has also borrowed heavily from China and Russia in recent years. Just this month, Rosneft, the Russian state owned oil company, disclosed that it had loaned Venezuela a total of $6 billion against future oil deliveries.\n\nThese debts present a massive vulnerability for the Maduro regime. Although Venezuela has made regular payments on its debts in recent years despite hyperinflation and a collapsing domestic economy, Venezuela's debt payments are rapidly becoming unsustainable absent a debt restructuring or new borrowing to \"roll over\" existing debts.\n\nLast year, Venezuela had to ship more than $1 billion of gold reserves from Caracas to Switzerland just to meet its obligations. Today, Venezuela has just $10 billion left in its total national reserves, and billions are due to repay international investors over the next five months alone. This looming fiscal crisis has already prompted market rumors that Maduro will approach creditors in a bid restructure Venezuela's debts.\n\nMaduro is likely to seek relief from near-term payment obligations in exchange for offering higher payments down the road. New U.S. sanctions could prohibit Maduro from restructuring these loans or otherwise borrowing on international markets. Unable to borrow, Maduro would see his finances crippled and be unable to continue paying off the cronies he relies on to prop up his regime in Caracas.\n\nThe U.S. has successfully used debt sanctions in the past. In 2014, U.S. sanctions prohibiting lending to big Russian state owned banks and energy companies helped put pressure on Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea and invasion of Eastern Ukraine. Frozen out of global capital markets and unable to issue new bonds to refinance old bonds as they came due, the sanctioned Russian companies required billions of dollars from the Russian government to stay solvent. A ban on lending to Venezuela would have even greater relative impact since Venezuela's financial reserves are today too small to bail the country out.\n\nWhile U.S. officials can and should replicate the debt sanctions the U.S. imposed on Russia in 2014 and impose them on Venezuela, an announcement this week by the foreign ministers of Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru and six other countries in the Western Hemisphere offers an additional and even broader tool to use Venezuela's debts to cripple Maduro's regime.\n\nThe 12 countries announced that they would henceforth not recognize any new debts or contracts issued by the Maduro government that, under Venezuela's constitution, require approval by Venezuela's democratically-elected National Assembly that Maduro replaced through a rigged July 30 national referendum. This includes most major debt issuances, as well as major new oil concessions.\n\nIn issuing this declaration, the foreign ministers sent a powerful message that not only should citizens of their countries not lend to Maduro, but that other countries, like Russia and China, should expect to have a hard time collecting on any money that they loan Maduro going forward. This is likely to deter lending by sharply increasing the odds that even Chinese or Russian creditors will be unable to collect when their loans come due. The declaration also makes clear that the governments do not view the Venezuelan people as responsible for debts that Maduro incurs going forward.\n\nHowever, while the sanctions on Venezuelan borrowing imposed by a dozen of the U.S.'s hemispheric partners represent a valuable start, the reality is that similar sanctions imposed by the U.S. -- the world's largest economy and one of Venezuela's largest creditors -- would have far more economic bite. Rather than threatening military force, the Trump administration can simply act to close off lending to Venezuela to pressure Maduro before he further entrenches his dictatorship.\n\nPeter Harrell is an adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.

Key to the populist rhetoric used by both is a constant drumbeat of warnings that the U.S. \"empire\" is planning an invasion to steal Venezuela's oil.\n\nThat threat was laughed off by the opposition and until Friday night, when Trump said a military option was not out of the question for dealing with the Venezuelan government's crackdown on the opposition and deepening social crisis.\n\n\"He's doing Maduro a favor by reinforcing the nationalist position that the Gringos want to come and attack Venezuela.

We would take the White House.\"\n\nMarches against Maduro were held in Caracas on Saturday, with few confrontations with state security forces and no deaths. More than 120 have been killed in unrest since April, as the economy collapses deeper into a recession compounded by triple-digit inflation as well as food and medicine shortages.\n\nOpposition leaders who have counted on the U.S. government to apply sustained moral and economic pressure on Maduro have so far been silent about Trump's remarks and marchers seemed confounded by his military threat.\n\n\"I don't know what to tell you,\" one woman marcher said, declining to give her name. \"It's very complicated.\"\n\n'NO GREATER GIFT'\n\nThe opposition, which controls a congress that has been neutered by Maduro's loyalist Supreme Court, boycotted last month's election of the new legislative superbody.\n\nOpposition leaders called instead for an early presidential election, which Maduro would likely lose as his popularity gets pummeled by the country's economic woes.\n\n\"Maduro could not have asked for a greater gift from Trump. He provided substance for Maduro's heretofore implausible conspiracy theories,\" said David Smilde, senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin American, a human rights think-tank.\n\nSmilde said Trump's threat of military force put the Venezuelan opposition \"on its heels\" after a group of Latin American governments joined last week in reprimanding Maduro for sponsoring the July 30 election of the constituent assembly.\n\n\"It has threatened to deflate the emerging regional consensus regarding Venezuela.

And Maduro has found an eager buyer in the form of Russia's biggest state owned oil company, Roseft.\n\nTo be sure, Venezuela's oil reserves are not worth all that much now, the price of fossil fuels being what they are. However, Vladimir Putin can profit by keeping those reserves on the ground which might jack up the worldwide market price of oil, benefiting Russia. If and when oil enjoys a price hike, Putin can turn on the spigot.\n\nOf course, the takeover of the Venezuelan oil industry is just the beginning. One should not be too surprised if Russia and Venezuela conclude some kind of military alliance, with a naval and air base for Putin's military that could directly threaten the United States.\n\nIn that context, no wonder Trump has started to issue threats.\n\nVery likely an invasion of Venezuela by American armed forces is not in the cards. However, the United States can work with South American allies, say Columbia and Brazil, to bring military pressure to bear. The CIA can contact Venezuelan dissident groups, some of whom are arming themselves, and friendly military commanders who might be persuaded to take down Maduro and restore democracy.\n\nBesides the geopolitical aspect of the country's sliding either into anarchy or a Cuban-style dictatorship, the humanitarian dimension of the crisis cannot be discounted. The Venezuelan people are dying from lack of food, medicine, and other essential goods. Maduro seems to be clueless on how to change that situation. His only solution appears to be to keep shooting and locking up people until things get better. The problem is, they will not get better so long as Maduro is in charge. #Vladimir Putin", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T09:37:00Z", "sim": 0.529411792755127, "source": {"uri": "us.blastingnews.com", "title": "Blasting News", "id": "6890"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "20:24:00", "url": "http://us.blastingnews.com/news/2017/08/why-did-trump-threaten-venezuela-with-military-intervention-001925469.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8839922", "image": "http://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/11/660x290/b_1433x630/nicolas-maduro-hugoshi-wikimedia-commons_1504635.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "09:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Key to the populist rhetoric used by both is a constant drumbeat of warnings that the US\"empire\" is planning an invasion to steal Venezuela's oil.\n\nThat threat was laughed off by the opposition and until Friday (Aug 11) night, when Trump said a military option was not out of the question for dealing with the Venezuelan government's crackdown on the opposition and deepening social crisis.\n\n\"He's doing Maduro a favour by reinforcing the nationalist position that the Gringos want to come and attack Venezuela. This has always been part of Maduro's rhetoric, and Chavez before him.

We would take the White House.\"\n\nMarches against Maduro were held in Caracas on Saturday, with few confrontations with state security forces and no deaths. More than 120 have been killed in unrest since April, as the economy collapses deeper into a recession compounded by triple-digit inflation as well as food and medicine shortages.\n\nOpposition leaders who have counted on the US government to apply sustained moral and economic pressure on Maduro have so far been silent about Trump's remarks and marchers seemed confounded by his military threat.\n\n\"I don't know what to tell you,\" one woman marcher said, declining to give her name. \"It's very complicated.\"\n\n'NO GREATER GIFT'\n\nThe opposition, which controls a congress that has been neutered by Maduro's loyalist Supreme Court, boycotted last month's election of the new legislative superbody.\n\nOpposition leaders called instead for an early presidential election, which Maduro would likely lose as his popularity gets pummeled by the country's economic woes.\n\n\"Maduro could not have asked for a greater gift from Trump. He provided substance for Maduro's heretofore implausible conspiracy theories,\" said David Smilde, senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin American, a human rights think-tank.\n\nSmilde said Trump's threat of military force put the Venezuelan opposition \"on its heels\" after a group of Latin American governments joined last week in reprimanding Maduro for sponsoring the July 30 election of the constituent assembly.\n\n\"It has threatened to deflate the emerging regional consensus regarding Venezuela.

against Venezuela amid controversy over Venezuela's creation of a National Constituent Assembly has drawn immediate condemnation among experts across Latin America.\n\nTrump said on Friday he would not rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela, a claim seemingly contradictory to the view of his top national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nArgentinean international law expert Paola de Simons told Xinhua that Trump was sending out \"a warning, (as a) foreign threat, which belongs to what were decades ago.\"\n\nDe Simone believed that these declarations \"show U.S. interference in the region, which will create a larger anti-imperialist sentiment among its peoples. Regional bodies should speak out to condemn this threat.\"\n\nTrump's threat came amid escalating tensions between Washington and Caracas over Venezuela's creation of the National Constituent Assembly (ANC) which was formed after an election on July 30.\n\nThe 545-member assembly, which has the rights to amend the constitution and reorganize the government, \"aims to repair the malfunction\" plaguing the country's governing system, according to Delcy Rodriguez, the recently elected president of the new legislative body.\n\nThe ANC has supreme power over all government branches, including the National Assembly, or Congress, which was under the opposition's control.\n\nFor Andres Villadiego, a Chilean political analyst, Trump's words are part of a \"tradition\" in the United States to ramp up the rhetoric towards disliked governments.\n\n\"In North American diplomacy, they never rule out the use of force, the military option. When governments are not aligned with their interests, the military option will be present,\" he explained.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury currently has sanctions in place against 21 Venezuelan officials, including Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Vice President Tareck El Aissami, Prosecutor-General Tarek William Saab, the Minister of Justice Nestor Reverol and Adan Chavez, brother to late President Hugo Chavez.\n\n\"This is another addition to the amount of pressure that the Maduro government is receiving internationally. However, I think there is only a remote possibility that this becomes a military aggression against Venezuela,\" said Villadiego, a professor at the University of Carabobo.\n\nIn Cuba, the threat was seen as a threat to peace in all of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nCuban analyst Luis Suarez said that Trump was violating the declaration signed in 2014 by the heads of state of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, declaring the region as a \"zone of peace.\"\n\n\"Part of the essential content of this declaration is the rejection, not only of military aggression, but of threatened use of forces as part of relations between nations of this hemisphere,\" said Suarez.\n\nCalling Trump's words a \"direct aggression\" against peace and independence of Latin America and the Caribbean, Suarez warned that a U.S. military attack against Venezuela could be hidden under the pretext of a \"humanitarian intervention.\"\n\n\"Trump is, in some way, validating all the options the United States has against Venezuela, since former President Barack Obama declared the country an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. national security in 2015,\" he explained.\n\nFor Yadira Galvez, an international relations professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), a U.S. strike against Venezuela would \"cause more problems\" in the entire region.\n\nGalvez noted \"no Latin American country\" would support a military strike.\n\nThe professor felt that Trump's choice of words was influenced by his tendency to \"intimidate and show he is a military world leader.\"\n\nRescuers continue search in quake-hit Jiuzhaigou", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-13", "textEnd": 20, "textStart": 13}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 992, "textStart": 985}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T09:21:00Z", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "source": {"uri": "english.sina.com", "title": "english.sina.com", "id": "2369"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:21:00", "url": "http://english.sina.com/news/2017-08-13/detail-ifyixipt1444205.shtml", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8895369", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "09:21:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

against Venezuela amid controversy over Venezuela's creation of a National Constituent Assembly has drawn immediate condemnation among experts across Latin America.\n\nTrump said on Friday he would not rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela, a claim seemingly contradictory to the view of his top national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nArgentinean international law expert Paola de Simons told Xinhua that Trump was sending out \"a warning, (as a) foreign threat, which belongs to what were decades ago.\"\n\nDe Simone believed that these declarations \"show U.S. interference in the region, which will create a larger anti-imperialist sentiment among its peoples. Regional bodies should speak out to condemn this threat.\"\n\nTrump's threat came amid escalating tensions between Washington and Caracas over Venezuela's creation of the National Constituent Assembly (ANC) which was formed after an election on July 30.\n\nThe 545-member assembly, which has the rights to amend the constitution and reorganize the government, \"aims to repair the malfunction\" plaguing the country's governing system, according to Delcy Rodriguez, the recently elected president of the new legislative body.\n\nThe ANC has supreme power over all government branches, including the National Assembly, or Congress, which was under the opposition's control.\n\nFor Andres Villadiego, a Chilean political analyst, Trump's words are part of a \"tradition\" in the United States to ramp up the rhetoric towards disliked governments.\n\n\"In North American diplomacy, they never rule out the use of force, the military option. When governments are not aligned with their interests, the military option will be present,\" he explained.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury currently has sanctions in place against 21 Venezuelan officials, including Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Vice President Tareck El Aissami, Prosecutor-General Tarek William Saab, the Minister of Justice Nestor Reverol and Adan Chavez, brother to late President Hugo Chavez.\n\n\"This is another addition to the amount of pressure that the Maduro government is receiving internationally. However, I think there is only a remote possibility that this becomes a military aggression against Venezuela,\" said Villadiego, a professor at the University of Carabobo.\n\nIn Cuba, the threat was seen as a threat to peace in all of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nCuban analyst Luis Suarez said that Trump was violating the declaration signed in 2014 by the heads of state of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, declaring the region as a \"zone of peace.\"\n\n\"Part of the essential content of this declaration is the rejection, not only of military aggression, but of threatened use of forces as part of relations between nations of this hemisphere,\" said Suarez.\n\nCalling Trump's words a \"direct aggression\" against peace and independence of Latin America and the Caribbean, Suarez warned that a U.S. military attack against Venezuela could be hidden under the pretext of a \"humanitarian intervention.\"\n\n\"Trump is, in some way, validating all the options the United States has against Venezuela, since former President Barack Obama declared the country an unusual and extraordinary threat to U.S. national security in 2015,\" he explained.\n\nFor Yadira Galvez, an international relations professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), a U.S. strike against Venezuela would \"cause more problems\" in the entire region.\n\nGalvez noted \"no Latin American country\" would support a military strike.\n\nThe professor felt that Trump's choice of words was influenced by his tendency to \"intimidate and show he is a military world leader.\"", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-13", "textEnd": 20, "textStart": 13}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 992, "textStart": 985}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T09:00:00Z", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "source": {"uri": "news.xinhuanet.com", "title": "Xinhuanet.com", "id": "942"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "09:00:00", "url": "http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-08/13/c_136522532.htm", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8893273", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "09:00:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

With a crisis about to boil over into war in Korea, could the United States afford to pick a fight in South America, even against a country whose government is locked in pitched street battles with its people? It turns out that Trump has every reason to worry about the beleaguered Latin American country becoming a strategic headache for the United States. Also, methods exist for applying military pressure that does not involve landing the United States Marines.\n\nBecause Venezuela is in the end stage of socialism, that being economic collapse.\n\nNicolas Maduro is desperate to raise enough cash and credit to keep his regime above water, at least for a few more months. He has turned to selling off the one asset that Venezuela has left, according to Hot Air, that being its #Oil Reserves. And Maduro has found an eager buyer in the form of Russia's biggest state owned oil company, Roseft.\n\nTo be sure, Venezuela's oil reserves are not worth all that much now, the price of fossil fuels being what they are. However, Vladimir Putin can profit by keeping those reserves on the ground which might jack up the worldwide market price of oil, benefiting Russia. If and when oil enjoys a price hike, Putin can turn on the spigot.\n\nOf course, the takeover of the Venezuelan oil industry is just the beginning. One should not be too surprised if Russia and Venezuela conclude some kind of military alliance, with a naval and air base for Putin's military that could directly threaten the United States.\n\nIn that context, no wonder Trump has started to issue threats.\n\nVery likely an invasion of Venezuela by American armed forces is not in the cards. However, the United States can work with South American allies, say Columbia and Brazil, to bring military pressure to bear. The CIA can contact Venezuelan dissident groups, some of whom are arming themselves, and friendly military commanders who might be persuaded to take down Maduro and restore democracy.\n\nBesides the geopolitical aspect of the country's sliding either into anarchy or a Cuban-style dictatorship, the humanitarian dimension of the crisis cannot be discounted. The Venezuelan people are dying from lack of food, medicine, and other essential goods. Maduro seems to be clueless on how to change that situation. His only solution appears to be to keep shooting and locking up people until things get better. The problem is, they will not get better so long as Maduro is in charge. #Vladimir Putin", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T20:44:00Z", "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "source": {"uri": "gearsofbiz.com", "title": "gearsofbiz.com", "id": "19218"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:29:00", "url": "http://gearsofbiz.com/why-did-trump-threaten-venezuela-with-military-intervention/7307", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8867224", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "20:44:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

President Nicolas Maduro has continued the free-spending socialist \"revolution\" started by his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez, almost 20 years ago. The key to the populist rhetoric used by both is a constant drumbeat of warnings that the U.S. \"empire\" is planning an invasion to steal Venezuela's oil.That threat was laughed off by the opposition and until Friday night when Trump said a military option was not out of the question for dealing with the Venezuelan government's crackdown on the opposition and deepening social crisis. \"He's doing Maduro a favor by reinforcing the nationalist position that the Gringos want to come and attack Venezuela. This has always been part of Maduro's rhetoric, and Chavez before him. And it has served them both well,\" said lawyer Luis Alberto Rodriguez while sitting at a cafe, smoking a Cuban cigar, in one of Caracas' wealthier neighborhoods. \"It's not going to have any impact other than the government using it to further unify its people and attack the opposition,\" the 44-year-old added. Maduro loyalists, who regularly insult opposition leaders as Washington's lackeys, wasted no time in pouncing.\n\n\"Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr. Trump!\" thundered Maduro's son, also named Nicolas, at the country's new constituent assembly, which was elected last month to rewrite the constitution.The opposition fears the assembly will remove any checks that remain on the president's powers and critics globally have condemned it as an affront to democracy.\"If Venezuela were attacked,\" the younger Maduro said, \"The rifles would arrive in New York, Mr. Trump. We would take the White House.\"Marches against Maduro were held in Caracas on Saturday, with few confrontations with state security forces and no deaths. More than 120 have been killed in unrest since April, as the economy collapses deeper into a recession compounded by triple-digit inflation as well as food and medicine shortages. Opposition leaders who have counted on the U.S. government to apply sustained moral and economic pressure on Maduro have so far been silent about Trump's remarks and marchers seemed confounded by his military threat.\"I don't know what to tell you,\" one woman marcher said, declining to give her name. \"It's very complicated.\"\n\n'NO GREATER GIFT'\n\nThe opposition, which controls a congress that has been neutered by Maduro's loyalist Supreme Court, boycotted last month's election of the new legislative super body.Opposition leaders called instead for an early presidential election, which Maduro would likely lose as his popularity gets pummeled by the country's economic woes.\"Maduro could not have asked for a greater gift from Trump.

This time it's Trump's sudden declaration that he would not rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela, where President Nicolas Maduro has been consolidating power, plunging the country into chaos.\n\nThe dramatic escalation in rhetoric seemed to upend carefully crafted U.S. policy that has stressed working with regional partners to increase pressure on Maduro. It also contradicted high-level administration officials, including Trump's own national security adviser, who had warned that any perception of U.S. intervention would stir decades' old resentments and play into Maduro's hands.\n\nIn this Aug. 10, 2017, photo, President Donald Trump, accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, speaks to reporters before a security briefing at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. Pence departs Sunday for Latin America, a trip that comes on the heels of yet another provocative statement fromTrump that Pence is sure to have to answer for: this time Trump's sudden declaration that he would not rule out a \"military option\" in Venezuela, where president Nicolas Maduro has been consolidating power, plunging the country into chaos. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nExperts on the region said the president's comments Friday would undoubtedly make Pence's task more difficult when he arrives Sunday in Cartagena, Colombia, on Venezuela's doorstep.\n\n\"Once again, Latin Americans will be looking for Pence to reassure them, to put a lot of daylight between his more traditional, moderate Republican views and those of his meandering president,\" said Richard Feinberg, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has extensive experience in the region.\n\nThe president's comments will also complicate the calculus of Latin American leaders, many of whom had been speaking out against Maduro's actions.\n\n\"It pulls the rug out from Latin American leaders who had braved internal political criticism to stand against the dictatorial trend in Venezuela and the human rights violations of the Maduro regime,\" said Mark L. Schneider, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\nHe said Trump's \"off the cuff comment\" on military options amounted to throwing Maduro \"a beautiful life preserver at a time when the growing Latin American consensus was causing fracturing within his own supporters and probably the military.\"\n\n\"Now they will have little option other than to unite at least rhetorically against the Trump threat to 'send in the Marines,'\" Schneider said.\n\nAlmost since Maduro took office in 2013, he has been warning of U.S. military designs on Venezuela, home to the world's largest oil reserves. Maduro has also directed his barbs at Trump, describing him as a crass imperial magnate and accusing him of backing a failed attack on a military base.\n\nJust last week, the foreign ministers of 17 Western Hemisphere nations met in Peru, where they issued a rare joint statement condemning Venezuela's new constitutional assembly and declaring that their governments would refuse to recognize the body.\n\nHarold Trinkunas, of Stanford University's Center for International Security and Cooperation, said it was the strongest condemnation of any fellow government that he has seen in a generation.\n\n\"In general, Latin American countries are very reluctant to criticize each other,\" he said.\n\nTrump's comment, Trinkunas said, will make it harder for Pence \"to convince Latin American leaders to publicly coordinate measures with the United States to increase pressure on the Maduro regime. Latin American states will not want to be seen as endorsing U.S. military intervention.\"\n\nIt was a concern raised by Trump's own national security adviser, H. R. McMaster, in a recent interview.\n\n\"Well, you know, there's a long history in the region of American intervention and that's caused problems in the past,\" he said. \"And so, I think we're very cognizant of the fact that we don't want to give this regime or others the opportunity to say, well, you know, this isn't the problem with the Maduro. This is the Yankees doing this.\"\n\nBut a spokesman for Pence insisted there was no daylight between him and the president.\n\n\"The president is sending the vice president to South and Central America to deliver a very clear message both to our partners in the region and to the Maduro regime. The president and the vice president have discussed the trip in depth and are totally aligned on the president's message to Venezuela and Latin America overall,\" said the spokesman, Jarrod Agen.\n\nPence's trip comes as the situation in Venezuela has grown increasingly desperate. The U.S. has accused Maduro of a sweeping power grab following the creation of a new constitutional assembly, which has been granted the power to rewrite Venezuela's constitution, declared itself superior to all other government institutions, and ousted Venezuela's outspoken chief prosecutor. The moves have sparked violent protests.\n\nPence's trip had been aimed both at rallying opposition to Maduro in his own backyard, as well as bolstering trade and economic and security cooperation with four key U.S. allies in the region. His schedule includes stops in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; and Panama City. The vice president is expected to meet with each of the country's leaders, deliver a major speech on U.S.-Latin American relations, and tour the Panama Canal.\n\nThe trip is the latest indication that Pence has emerged as the U.S.'s top voice on the region - a distinction that was also held by his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n\"Once again the U.S. is sending the vice president to deal with Latin America,\" said Vanda Felbab-Brown, a senior fellow at The Brookings Institution. While some might view that as \"downgrading,\" she said, many leaders in the region may prefer dealing with Pence.\n\n\"I think they consider Pence more predictable and measured,\" she said.\n\n__\n\nFollow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-10", "textEnd": 846, "textStart": 833}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T18:40:00Z", "sim": 0.5215686559677124, "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "title": "Mail Online", "id": "214"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "18:40:00", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/~/article-4785116/index.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8829676", "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2017/08/12/19/wire-1123955-1502562686-312_636x382.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "18:40:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Key to the populist rhetoric used by both is a constant drumbeat of warnings that the U.S. \"empire\" is planning an invasion to steal Venezuela's oil.\n\nThat threat was laughed off by the opposition and until Friday night, when Trump said a military option was not out of the question for dealing with the Venezuelan government's crackdown on the opposition and deepening social crisis.\n\n\"He's doing Maduro a favour by reinforcing the nationalist position that the Gringos want to come and attack Venezuela. This has always been part of Maduro's rhetoric, and Chavez before him. And it has served them both well,\" said lawyer Luis Alberto Rodriguez while sitting at a cafe, smoking a Cuban cigar, in one of Caracas' wealthier neighbourhoods.\n\n\"It's not going to have any impact other than the government using it to further unify its people and attack the opposition,\" the 44-year-old added.\n\nMaduro loyalists, who regularly insult opposition leaders as Washington's lackeys, wasted no time in pouncing.\n\n\"Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr. Trump!\" thundered Maduro's son, also named Nicolas, at the country's new constituent assembly, which was elected last month to re-write the constitution.\n\nThe opposition fears the assembly will remove any checks that remain on the president's powers and critics globally have condemned it as an affront to democracy.\n\n\"If Venezuela were attacked,\" the younger Maduro said, \"The rifles would arrive in New York, Mr. Trump. We would take the White House.\"\n\nMarches against Maduro were held in Caracas on Saturday, with few confrontations with state security forces and no deaths.

Key to the populist rhetoric used by both is a constant drumbeat of warnings that the U.S. \"empire\" is planning an invasion to steal Venezuela's oil.\n\nThat threat was laughed off by the opposition and until Friday night, when Trump said a military option was not out of the question for dealing with the Venezuelan government's crackdown on the opposition and deepening social crisis.\n\n\"He's doing Maduro a favor by reinforcing the nationalist position that the Gringos want to come and attack Venezuela.

But though he declared that the armed forces were \"locked and loaded,\" there were no indications of imminent action in either part of the world.\n\nFor all the bellicose language emerging from the president's golf club in Bedminster, the U.S. military was taking no visible steps to prepare for a strike against North Korea or Venezuela. The Pentagon reported no new ships being sent toward the Korean Peninsula or forces being mobilized, nor were there moves to begin evacuating any of the tens of thousands of Americans living in South Korea.\n\nThe juxtaposition between the heated words and the lack of apparent preparations suggested that Trump may still be counting on a resolution to the standoff with North Korea as it works to develop a nuclear arsenal capable of reaching the United States. After escalating his rhetoric against North Korea twice on Friday, Trump emerged from a late-afternoon meeting with his national security team offering a somewhat more restrained message, vowing to give diplomacy a chance.\n\n\"Hopefully it'll all work out,\" Trump told reporters, noting that he would call President Xi Jinping of China on Friday evening to coordinate strategy. \"Nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump, that I can tell you. Hopefully it'll all work out, but this has been going on for many years.\"\n\nSecretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, who traveled to New Jersey on Friday to brief Trump after returning from Asia, said the president's tough language was part of an overall strategy intended to bring North Korea to the negotiating table.\n\n\"It takes a combined message there if we're going to get effective movement out of the regime in North Korea. I think the president's made it clear he prefers a diplomatic solution,\" Tillerson said, standing next to Trump. \"What the president's doing is trying to support our efforts by ensuring North Korea understands what the stakes are.\"\n\nStill, even as Trump seemed to be slightly lowering the temperature with North Korea, he opened a new front by volunteering that he was contemplating the use of force in Venezuela. The government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of Venezuela has moved to shut down the opposition-controlled parliament after a fraud-plagued referendum amid a spiraling economic crisis.\n\n\"Venezuela is not very far away and the people are suffering and they're dying,\" Trump said. \"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary.\"\n\nJust a day earlier, Maduro told delegates in Caracas he wanted to meet with Trump, possibly at the annual U.N.

Venezuela\n\nLatin American countries often critical of Venezuela have rejected the United States' threat to use force against the conflict-hit country.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the South American trade bloc Mercosur rejected US President Donald Trump's suggestion that a \"military option\" was possible to solve the ongoing domestic political crisis in Venezuela, saying that, \"The only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialog and diplomacy.\"\n\nThe bloc, which consists of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, added, \"The repudiation of violence and any option that implies the use of force is inalienable and constitutes the fundamental basis for democratic coexistence.\"\n\nOther South American countries, such as Peru, Mexico, and Colombia, also joined the chorus of Latin American unity against the US with statements of their own, criticizing Washington's threat of military action against Caracas as a move against the United Nations' principles.\n\nSenior Venezuelan officials have also responded to Trump's threat. Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino denounced the threat as \"an act of craziness,\" and Communications Minister Ernesto Villegas described it as \"an unprecedented threat to national sovereignty.\"\n\nVenezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza also has rejected the threat as \"hostile,\" and called on Latin America to unite against Washington.\n\n\"The reckless threat by President Trump aims to drag Latin America and the Caribbean into a conflict that would permanently alter stability, peace, and security in our region,\" he said.\n\nTrump's threat came as the oil-rich but impoverished country has been convulsed by months of deadly protests against the government in Caracas.\n\nWhile some of the Latin American countries that rejected the use of force against Venezuela have been critical of Caracas, Trump's threat seemed to have been an escalation that warranted a rare moment of unity with the Venezuelan government. They did not, however, offer any explicit support for Caracas beyond rejecting the American threat of force.\n\nPolitical tensions in Venezuela rose recently after Caracas announced plans to establish a Constituent Assembly to take over the opposition-controlled parliament and rewrite the constitution. The opposition saw the move as an overt attempt by President Nicolas Maduro to accumulate power.\n\nProtests erupted on the streets, and clashes led to the death of at least 120 people from the two sides.\n\nThe elections were held for the 545-member Constituent Assembly according to plan on July 30, and the government said more than eight million people participated.\n\nMaduro, who as president is the head of the Venezuelan state, later \"subordinated\" himself to the Assembly.\n\nSiding with the opposition, the US has blamed Maduro for the violence and has urged regional and international governments to take strong action against his government. The US imposed sanctions against current and former Venezuelan officials over the crisis, and the US Treasury Department later froze \"dictator\" Maduro's US assets for going ahead with the elections.\n\nThe 54-year-old socialist leader says the US and its allies in the region are inciting the violence to bring down his government.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 2595, "textStart": 2588}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T06:13:00Z", "sim": 0.5098039507865906, "source": {"uri": "presstv.ir", "title": "presstv.ir", "id": "9258"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:13:00", "url": "http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2017/08/13/531569/Latin-America-Venezuela-support-US-military-threat", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8878393", "image": "http://media.presstv.com/photo/20170813/e1cbcbc9-2ff2-4768-b611-a0de2af9ef9e.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "06:13:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

America trip by Vice President Mike Pence intended to showcase how Washington and regional partners can work together to promote democracy in the hemisphere.\n\nThis week in Peru, foreign ministers from 12 Western Hemisphere nations condemned the breakdown of democracy in Venezuela and refused to recognize a new, pro-government assembly created by Maduro that is charged with rewriting the constitution but is seen by many as an illegitimate power grab.\n\nThe United States did not take part in the meeting, a show of deference to countries historically mistrustful of heavy-handed policies out of Washington. Suspicion and resentment linger in many corners of the region, a reflection of years past when U.S. troops did in fact invade parts of Latin America to oust leftist leaders or collect unpaid debts.\n\nYet a number of leaders, amid prodding from the Trump administration, have lately been overcoming their reluctance to intervene in a neighbor's internal political affairs after looking the other ways for years on Venezuela.\n\nFor the first time, leaders have started using the D-word -- dictatorship -- to describe Venezuela's government and have recalled their ambassadors from Caracas in protest. Peru on Friday went so far as to expel Venezuela's ambassador, and last week the South American trade bloc Mercosur suspended Venezuela for violating the group's democratic norms.\n\nEven more surprising, with the exception of close ideological allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, no country spoke out against Trump's decision to slap sanctions on more than 30 Venezuelan officials, including Maduro himself, despite past criticism of similar unilateral actions.\n\nNot even the frustration over Trump's decision to partially roll back Obama's opening to Cuba -- a diplomatic thaw that was applauded across the region's political spectrum -- or his constant talk of building a border wall to keep out immigrants got in the way of presenting a united front toward Maduro.\n\nBut the swift reaction to Trump's \"military\" remarks shows there is no appetite in the region for U.S. troops to get involved.\n\nOn Saturday the nations of Mercosur, which includes Brazil and Argentina, issued a statement saying \"the only acceptable means of promoting democracy are dialogue and diplomacy\" and repudiating \"violence and any option that implies the use of force.\"\n\nU.S. engagement with other countries has not been constant and may have benefited more from the deteriorating situation in Venezuela than any concerted diplomatic outreach. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson skipped a key meeting of the Organization of American States in June, depriving some Caribbean countries that depend on Venezuelan oil shipments of the political cover they were looking for to abandon their support for Maduro.\n\nUnder the advice of Pence and Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, Trump appears to have taken a personal interest in Venezuela and even met at the White House with the wife of a prominent jailed opposition leader. That in turn has emboldened Maduro opponents who have been protesting for four months demanding he give up power.\n\nTheir efforts could be undermined if Maduro expands his crackdown on dissent, arguing as he has in the past that their tactics are a prelude to a U.S.-backed coup. Only this time he can point to Trump's words as evidence.\n\nPence arrives in Colombia on Sunday to begin his Latin America tour, during which discussions on how to deal with Venezuela were expected to feature prominently. Instead he may now be forced to do damage control, said Christopher Sabatini, executive director of Global Americans, a website focused on U.S. policy in the region.\n\n\"He's about to get an earful,\" Sabatini said. \"The eagerness of Trump and some people around him to mouth off without any idea of context is really damaging not only to U.S. policy but also regional stability.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T21:39:00Z", "sim": 0.5098039507865906, "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "title": "The New York Times", "id": "91"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "21:39:00", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2017/08/12/world/americas/ap-lt-venezuela-trump-analysis.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8846583", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "21:39:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-12"}

Key to the populist rhetoric used by both is a constant drumbeat of warnings that the U.S. \"empire\" is planning an invasion to steal Venezuela's oil.\n\nThat threat was laughed off by the opposition and until Friday night, when Trump said a military option was not out of the question for dealing with the Venezuelan government's crackdown on the opposition and deepening social crisis.\n\n\"He's doing Maduro a favor by reinforcing the nationalist position that the Gringos want to come and attack Venezuela. This has always been part of Maduro's rhetoric, and Chavez before him. And it has served them both well,\" said lawyer Luis Alberto Rodriguez while sitting at a cafe, smoking a Cuban cigar, in one of Caracas' wealthier neighborhoods.\n\n\"It's not going to have any impact other than the government using it to further unify its people and attack the opposition,\" the 44-year-old added.\n\nMaduro loyalists, who regularly insult opposition leaders as Washington's lackeys, wasted no time in pouncing.\n\n\"Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr. Trump!\" thundered Maduro's son, also named Nicolas, at the country's new constituent assembly, which was elected last month to re-write the constitution.\n\nThe opposition fears the assembly will remove any checks that remain on the president's powers and critics globally have condemned it as an affront to democracy.\n\n\"If Venezuela were attacked,\" the younger Maduro said, \"The rifles would arrive in New York, Mr. Trump. We would take the White House.\"\n\nMarches against Maduro were held in Caracas on Saturday, with few confrontations with state security forces and no deaths. More than 120 have been killed in unrest since April, as the economy collapses deeper into a recession compounded by triple-digit inflation as well as food and medicine shortages.\n\nOpposition leaders who have counted on the U.S. government to apply sustained moral and economic pressure on Maduro have so far been silent about Trump's remarks and marchers seemed confounded by his military threat.\n\n\"I don't know what to tell you,\" one woman marcher said, declining to give her name. \"It's very complicated.\"\n\n'NO GREATER GIFT'\n\nThe opposition, which controls a congress that has been neutered by Maduro's loyalist Supreme Court, boycotted last month's election of the new legislative superbody.\n\nOpposition leaders called instead for an early presidential election, which Maduro would likely lose as his popularity gets pummeled by the country's economic woes.\n\n\"Maduro could not have asked for a greater gift from Trump. He provided substance for Maduro's heretofore implausible conspiracy theories,\" said David Smilde, senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin American, a human rights think-tank.\n\nSmilde said Trump's threat of military force put the Venezuelan opposition \"on its heels\" after a group of Latin American governments joined last week in reprimanding Maduro for sponsoring the July 30 election of the constituent assembly.\n\n\"It has threatened to deflate the emerging regional consensus regarding Venezuela.

If you did, that's also certainly understandable, as that seems to occupy the lion's share of foreign affairs coverage in the U.S. media today. However, you'd be wrong. There's a simmering crisis involving a major American trading partner in the Western Hemisphere that the media isn't covering nearly as thoroughly as it should: the imminent collapse of Venezuela.\n\nMasked anti-government demonstrators stand next to a burning barricade during a protest against the installation of a constitutional assembly in Caracas, Venezuela. Associated Press/Ariana Cubillos Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nThe crisis in Venezuela really began under the previous president, Hugo Chavez, who imposed his vision of socialism on the country. He took the profits from the country's oil exports and invested them towards his goal of reformulating Venezuelan society, which helped lead to an economic crisis of massive proportions. This led to massive protests, especially under his equally corrupt but far less charismatic successor, Nicolas Maduro. Thanks to Maduro's incompetence, the opposition took control of parliament several years ago. Rather than listen to the will of the people, however, Maduro ignored the election results. Currently, a constitutional assembly packed with his supporters through a rigged election is working to end democracy in the country. They removed the country's chief prosecutor, a top critic of the president, from power and declared themselves the top governmental body in the country. Maduro, meanwhile, is working feverishly to stifle dissent, arresting and killing opposition leaders.\n\nNow, to be sure, Venezuela has had its share of political crises before. Economic instability has led to coup attempts in the past, and Nicolas Maduro is not the first dictator in the country's history. However, for 40 years before the rise of Hugo Chavez, the country had enjoyed democracy and -- for the most part -- economic stability, thanks to their oil exports. Even after Chavez pushed through a new constitution in 1999, he allowed some semblance of democracy to persist; Venezuelans actually rejected his attempt to expand his powers in 2007. Maduro seems intent on stripping all of those semblances aside and assigning himself absolute power.\n\nThe United States is, rightly, condemning Maduro's actions, and is imposing sanctions against individual members of his regime. We have clear moral reasons to act against a regime that is violating the human rights of its citizens, but there are strategic reasons to act as well. Venezuela is a major power in the region, and instability there could undermine regional stability, returning the continent to the days of coups, dictatorships, and revolutions. While it may be too late to prevent an all-out civil war in Venezuela, it may not be too late to prevent it from spreading.\n\nFortunately, the United States has a lot of potential sway here. We are their major trading partner by far, accounting for almost a quarter of both their imports and exports. In other words, trade with the United States is the backbone of the Venezuelan economy, but that's hardly the case in reverse. The U.S. mainly imports oil from Venezuela, and -- thanks in no small part to the growth of domestic production of late -- that accounts for only about 6 percent of our supply. So, we could completely cut off trade with Venezuela without doing crippling damage to our own economy.\n\nHowever, the U.S. should tread cautiously there: In the past, sanctions have propped up enemy regimes by giving them the perfect foil. Maduro already paints the U.S. as an enemy, so he could benefit from sanctions. Sanctions spectacularly failed to lead to regime change in countries like Iraq, North Korea and Cuba; there's no reason to think that they would be successful here, either. Once you impose sweeping trade sanctions, you've used your biggest threat short of military intervention. That's why the administration has thus far wisely imposed limited sanctions instead, targeting individual members of the Maduro regime.\n\nAs consumers we can refuse to do business with Venezuelan companies. The most prominent of these locally is Citgo, which is majority-owned by the Venezuelan state oil company and minority-owned by the Russian state oil company. If you want to avoid supporting the Maduro regime, then you should certainly avoid refills at Citgo stations.\n\nFor now, other than that, all any of us can do is hope that there's a peaceful resolution.\n\nJim Fossel, a conservative activist from Gardiner, worked for Sen.

Key to the populist rhetoric used by both is a constant drumbeat of warnings that the U.S. \"empire\" is planning an invasion to steal Venezuela's oil.\n\nThat threat was laughed off by the opposition and until Friday night, when Trump said a military option was not out of the question for dealing with the Venezuelan government's crackdown on the opposition and deepening social crisis.\n\n\"He's doing Maduro a favor by reinforcing the nationalist position that the Gringos want to come and attack Venezuela. This has always been part of Maduro's rhetoric, and Chavez before him. And it has served them both well,\" said lawyer Luis Alberto Rodriguez while sitting at a cafe, smoking a Cuban cigar, in one of Caracas' wealthier neighborhoods.\n\n\"It's not going to have any impact other than the government using it to further unify its people and attack the opposition,\" the 44-year-old added.\n\nMaduro loyalists, who regularly insult opposition leaders as Washington's lackeys, wasted no time in pouncing.\n\n\"Mind your own business and solve your own problems, Mr. Trump!\" thundered Maduro's son, also named Nicolas, at the country's new constituent assembly, which was elected last month to re-write the constitution.\n\nThe opposition fears the assembly will remove any checks that remain on the president's powers and critics globally have condemned it as an affront to democracy.\n\n\"If Venezuela were attacked,\" the younger Maduro said, \"The rifles would arrive in New York, Mr. Trump. We would take the White House.\"\n\nMarches against Maduro were held in Caracas on Saturday, with few confrontations with state security forces and no deaths. More than 120 have been killed in unrest since April, as the economy collapses deeper into a recession compounded by triple-digit inflation as well as food and medicine shortages.\n\nOpposition leaders who have counted on the U.S. government to apply sustained moral and economic pressure on Maduro have so far been silent about Trump's remarks and marchers seemed confounded by his military threat.\n\n\"I don't know what to tell you,\" one woman marcher said, declining to give her name. \"It's very complicated.\"\n\n'NO GREATER GIFT'\n\nThe opposition, which controls a congress that has been neutered by Maduro's loyalist Supreme Court, boycotted last month's election of the new legislative superbody.\n\nOpposition leaders called instead for an early presidential election, which Maduro would likely lose as his popularity gets pummeled by the country's economic woes.\n\n\"Maduro could not have asked for a greater gift from Trump. He provided substance for Maduro's heretofore implausible conspiracy theories,\" said David Smilde, senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin American, a human rights think-tank.\n\nSmilde said Trump's threat of military force put the Venezuelan opposition \"on its heels\" after a group of Latin American governments joined last week in reprimanding Maduro for sponsoring the July 30 election of the constituent assembly.\n\n\"It has threatened to deflate the emerging regional consensus regarding Venezuela. Today the countries that on Tuesday signed on to a strong statement criticizing Maduro's authoritarian direction are spending their time criticizing Trump's statements,\" Smilde said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Eyanir Chinea; Editing by Mary Milliken)\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-13", "textEnd": 34, "textStart": 28}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2017-07-30", "textEnd": 3386, "textStart": 3379}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T05:08:00Z", "sim": 0.4901960790157318, "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "title": "The Times of India", "id": "1185"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "05:08:00", "url": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trumps-threat-of-venezuela-military-action-could-bolster-maduro/articleshow/60042403.cms", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8874195", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "05:08:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

If you did, that's also certainly understandable, as that seems to occupy the lion's share of foreign affairs coverage in the U.S. media today. However, you'd be wrong. There's a simmering crisis involving a major American trading partner in the Western Hemisphere that the media isn't covering nearly as thoroughly as it should: the imminent collapse of Venezuela.\n\nVenezuelan troops fire rubber bullets at anti-government protesters in Caracas last month. Associated Press/Ariana Cubillos Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nThe crisis in Venezuela really began under the previous president, Hugo Chavez, who imposed his vision of socialism on the country. He took the profits from the country's oil exports and invested them towards his goal of reformulating Venezuelan society, which helped lead to an economic crisis of massive proportions. This led to massive protests, especially under his equally corrupt but far less charismatic successor, Nicolas Maduro. Thanks to Maduro's incompetence, the opposition took control of parliament several years ago. Rather than listen to the will of the people, however, Maduro ignored the election results.\n\nCurrently, a constitutional assembly packed with his supporters through a rigged election is working to end democracy in the country. They removed the country's chief prosecutor, a top critic of the president, from power and declared themselves the top governmental body in the country. Maduro, meanwhile, is working feverishly to stifle dissent, arresting and killing opposition leaders.\n\nNow, to be sure, Venezuela has had its share of political crises before. Economic instability has led to coup attempts in the past, and Nicolas Maduro is not the first dictator in the country's history. However, for 40 years before the rise of Hugo Chavez, the country had enjoyed democracy and - for the most part - economic stability, thanks to its oil exports. Even after Chavez pushed through a new constitution in 1999, he allowed some semblance of democracy to persist; Venezuelans actually rejected his attempt to expand his powers in 2007. Maduro seems intent on stripping all of those semblances aside and assigning himself absolute power.\n\nThe United States is, rightly, condemning Maduro's actions, and is imposing sanctions against individual members of his regime. We have clear moral reasons to act against a regime that is violating the human rights of its citizens, but there are strategic reasons to act as well. Venezuela is a major power in the region, and instability there could undermine regional stability, returning the continent to the days of coups, dictatorships and revolutions. While it may be too late to prevent an all-out civil war in Venezuela, it may not be too late to prevent it from spreading.\n\nFortunately, the United States has a lot of potential sway here. We are Venezuela's major trading partner, by far, accounting for almost a quarter of both its imports and exports. In other words, trade with the U.S. is the backbone of the Venezuelan economy, but that's hardly the case in reverse. The U.S. mainly imports oil from Venezuela, and - thanks in no small part to the growth of domestic production of late - that accounts for only about 6 percent of our supply. So we could completely cut off trade with Venezuela without doing crippling damage to our own economy.\n\nHowever, the U.S. should tread cautiously there: In the past, sanctions have propped up enemy regimes by giving them the perfect foil. Maduro already paints the U.S. as an enemy, so he could benefit from sanctions. Sanctions spectacularly failed to lead to regime change in countries like Iraq, North Korea and Cuba; there's no reason to think that they would be successful here, either. Once you impose sweeping trade sanctions, you've used your biggest threat short of military intervention. That's why the administration has thus far wisely imposed limited sanctions instead, targeting individual members of the Maduro regime.\n\nAs consumers, we can refuse to do business with Venezuelan companies. The most prominent of these locally is Citgo, which is majority-owned by the Venezuelan state oil company and minority-owned by the Russian state oil company. If you want to avoid supporting the Maduro regime, then you should certainly avoid refills at Citgo stations.\n\nFor now, other than that, all any of us can do is hope that there's a peaceful resolution.\n\nJim Fossel, a conservative activist from Gardiner, worked for Sen.

Everything is empty. You can see that all the aisles are completely empty,\" Haim Sadna told Channel 2 in an interview aired Saturday.\n\nHis wife Estella complained of the difficulty in Venezuela of buying basic products such as milk for her kids, adding that \"since Passover we haven't had bread.\"\n\n\"We lived in a beautiful home with seven rooms.

(Screen capture: Channel 2)\n\nThe Sadnas also noted the collapse of public services in the country such as healthcare, as well the sky-high crime rates, with Venezuela having some of the world's worst murder statistics.\n\n\"The crime situation is [so bad] that it is scary to go out to the street. I only go out of it is essential and that is it,\" Estella said. \"At five p.m. we would run home.\"\n\n\"The situation got worse and worse. We could no longer go out to the street,\" she continued. \"On most days the kids didn't go to school. They said they were in jail, that the house was a jail.

Israel has been working behind the scenes in order to bring as many of those remaining as possible to Jewish state, according to Channel 2.\n\nIllustrative: A young Jewish boy reads from the Torah on his Bar Mitzvah in Magen David synagogue in Caracas, Venezuela.

Last month, a batch of 26 Jews arrived in the Jewish state from Venezuela.\n\nOfer Dahan, who heads the immigration department for the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews, told Channel 2 that the state has increased its aid to Venezuelan immigrants as the situation in the country has gotten worse.\n\nAn opposition activist throws a Molotov cocktail during clashes with security forces in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas on August 12, 2017.

about a \"possible military option\" in Venezuela constitute a \"serious aggression\" to Latin America and the Caribbean, a Cuban professor said here on Saturday.\n\nLuis Suarez, a Cuban professor on international relations, reckons this direct threat as an explicit violation of the declaration of Latin America and the Caribbean as a peace zone, signed in Havana in 2014 by all presidents of the region during the annual summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.\n\n\"Part of the essential content of the declaration is that all countries reject not only military aggression but also any threats to use force as part of the mechanism of relations between nations of the hemisphere,\" he told Xinhua.\n\nTrump said on Friday, \"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary.\"\n\nHis remarks came amid growing tensions between Washington and Caracas over Venezuela's controversial Constituent National Assembly (ANC) formed after an election late last month.\n\nThe United States has imposed a series of sanctions on Venezuelan individuals involved in the ANC, including Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, to support the opposition Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD), which boycotted the July 30 election as it claimed the ANC would only consolidate the power of the ruling party.\n\nSuarez said the new escalation of Trump's remarks is a \"direct aggression\" to the peace and independence of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nAccording to Suarez, the U.S. military option in Venezuela could be carried out under the pretext of a \"humanitarian intervention.\"\n\n\"What Trump said somehow opens up all the options that have been assessed by Washington regarding Venezuela,\" Suarez said.\n\nSuarez said Trump's words are part of a \"plan\" carried out in the last few months to topple the Venezuelan leader and \"implode\" the nation with severe food and medicine shortages.\n\nThe expert said Washington has been trying to \"legitimize\" its policy of aggression against Caracas in the last few weeks to justify a possible military intervention.\n\n\"This U.S. administration has a deep inclination to militarism and that simply has to be denounced,\" he said.\n\nIn this context, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence heads to four Latin American countries, Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama in the next few days.\n\n\"The U.S. vice president specifically visits four of the governments that have been very active throughout this operation of aggression and pressure against Venezuela,\" said Suarez.", "extractedDates":

over the world and we have troops all over the world in places that are very, very far away,\" Trump said. \"Venezuela is not very far away and people are suffering and dying.\"\n\nIt was a restatement of a White House statement last July 18, where military options were implicitly suggested in these remarks here:\n\nOn Tuesday a senior White House official said that \"all options are on the table\" if Venezuela goes ahead with the vote.\n\n\"The president is very concerned about the well being of the Venezuelan people, the incredible erosion of democracy right before our eyes,\" the official said.\n\n\"And he has instructed us to do everything we can to support democracy there.\"\n\nSo that's two warnings issued to the Chavista regime. Venezuela's socialists have obviously ignored the first one in that they went through with their phony July 30 referendum to strip Venezuela's opposition legislature of any power and replace it with a handpicked Chavista super-legislature, known as the National Constituent Assembly, with the \"right\" to rewrite the constitution. The opposition, knowing that the votes had already been pre-counted in Havana, refused to participate in the farce. Nobody willingly votes himself into Cuba-style communist slavery.\n\nNow the warning comes from Trump himself, and it's far more direct and explicit.\n\nIn my piece here, I concluded that the White House warning about military options was probably psychological warfare, something to scare the Chavistas into going straight. Now that they have shown themselves impervious to threats, as well as hard sanctions, the U.S. may be inching closer to the real thing.\n\nWhy do I think that?\n\nNumber one, because of the Pentagon's cryptic response.\n\n\"I refer you to the White House \u200eto clarify the president's comments,\" Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon said. \"The Pentagon has received no orders in regard to Venezuela.\"\n\n\"The military conducts contingency planning for a variety of situations,\" Pahon continued. \"If called upon, we are prepared to support whole-of-government efforts to protect our national interest and safeguard U.S. citizens.\"\n\nIt goes without saying that the Pentagon is hardly going to announce an invasion before it happens, so naturally, it would say it has no orders. Number two, those orders would probably be proposed by the National Security Council for the president's approval, not the Pentagon alone.\n\nIt's that second half of the statement that is worth looking at, specifically the last, superfluous sentence.\n\nIf called upon, we are prepared to support whole-of-government efforts to protect our national interest and safeguard U.S. citizens.\n\nSince Trump's first July 18 warning, a lot of stuff has happened since then - not just the July 30 referendum, but also the mysterious raid on an elite, high-security military installation near Valencia, where, apparently, opponents of the regime successfully breached the compound and made off with a large number of weapons, presumably for a rebellion or civil war.\n\nRecall that Russia has supplied Venezuela with thousands of rifles but also 5,000 MANPADS, or hand-held surface-to-air missiles. If the raiders were not apparent rebels, but perhaps drug dealers, Mexican cartel members, ISIS, or FARC terrorists, the picture of the raid looks very different. It shows a country whose military is falling apart, and its disintegration is running to the benefit of the region's worst non-state actors. In that case, a military invasion might be easily justified, given the direct threat to U.S. national security. It would square with the Pentagon's last remark.\n\nMeanwhile, the foreign policy establishment is up in arms about the remarks, saying President Trump is losing friends in the region.\n\nHis temperate approach over the past few weeks has helped build a regional coalition that was very vocal in denouncing and putting pressure on the Venezuelan government,\" said Christopher Sabatini, a Columbia University international relations and policy lecturer. \"By sounding off now, he has really made it much more difficult for Latin American governments to adhere to what is seen as the U.S. position.\n\nHe's also, of course, tapped - I think unwittingly - into this deep, deep, legitimate worry and fear of U.S. intervention. This doesn't play well in Latin America.\"\n\nOn that, I suspect that the call is wrong. The analysts leveling the criticisms (and I know and have great respect for Chris Sabatini) are operating on old information, and I argue that the times have since changed.\n\nThe indicator for that is Vice President Pence's upcoming trip to Latin America, which will see him paying visits to four strategically important countries to the Venezuelan situation: Panama, Colombia, Argentina, and Chile. Panama and Colombia are already experiencing human waves of Venezuelan refugees spilling over into their countries (as is Brazil), and Argentina and Chile are important nations to get on our side. Their own histories, and in Chile's case, its leftist government, predispose them to be hostile to U.S. but usually not any other invasions. Pence's mission may be to just get Chile to stay quiet, and perhaps to get Argentina onboard. I can't see Panama or Colombia opposing a military invasion, given the problems they are facing with refugees. Times have changed, and the status quo has since shifted.\n\nCould there be an invasion while the U.S. is so tied up with North Korea and the Obama administration left the U.S. military so depleted? That would tilt the balance a bit toward wait-and-see. Leon Panetta, a former defense secretary, puts it obnoxiously toward President Trump, but he might have a point about whether the U.S. can handle another flashpoint in the wake of the North Korean crisis. There may be a military invasion of Venezuela, but from what is known so far, unless the threat is real and immediate in the wake of the weapons raid or another event, and unless it would be a real cheapie to execute, it won't happen today or tomorrow.", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textEnd": 388, "amb": false, "date": "2017-07-18", "textStart": 381, "freq": 2}, {"imp": true, "textEnd": 989, "amb": false, "date": "2017-07-30", "textStart": 982, "freq": 2}], "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T13:37:00Z", "sim": 0.4627451002597809, "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "title": "americanthinker.com", "id": "95"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "03:28:00", "url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2017/08/so_is_trump_serious_about_taking_out_venezuela.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8867169", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "13:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

about a \"possible military option\" in Venezuela constitute a \"serious aggression\" to Latin America and the Caribbean, a Cuban professor said here on Saturday.\n\nLuis Suarez, a Cuban professor on international relations, reckons this direct threat as an explicit violation of the declaration of Latin America and the Caribbean as a peace zone, signed in Havana in 2014 by all presidents of the region during the annual summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.\n\n\"Part of the essential content of the declaration is that all countries reject not only military aggression but also any threats to use force as part of the mechanism of relations between nations of the hemisphere,\" he told Xinhua.\n\nTrump said on Friday, \"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary.\"\n\nHis remarks came amid growing tensions between Washington and Caracas over Venezuela's controversial Constituent National Assembly (ANC) formed after an election late last month.\n\nThe United States has imposed a series of sanctions on Venezuelan individuals involved in the ANC, including Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, to support the opposition Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD), which boycotted the July 30 election as it claimed the ANC would only consolidate the power of the ruling party.\n\nSuarez said the new escalation of Trump's remarks is a \"direct aggression\" to the peace and independence of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nAccording to Suarez, the U.S. military option in Venezuela could be carried out under the pretext of a \"humanitarian intervention.\"\n\n\"What Trump said somehow opens up all the options that have been assessed by Washington regarding Venezuela,\" Suarez said.\n\nSuarez said Trump's words are part of a \"plan\" carried out in the last few months to topple the Venezuelan leader and \"implode\" the nation with severe food and medicine shortages.\n\nThe expert said Washington has been trying to \"legitimize\" its policy of aggression against Caracas in the last few weeks to justify a possible military intervention.\n\n\"This U.S. administration has a deep inclination to militarism and that simply has to be denounced,\" he said.\n\nIn this context, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence heads to four Latin American countries, Colombia, Argentina, Chile and Panama in the next few days.\n\n\"The U.S. vice president specifically visits four of the governments that have been very active throughout this operation of aggression and pressure against Venezuela,\" said Suarez.\n\nCentral delegation

Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's controversial new Constituent Assembly took over from its fragile Parliament on Tuesday, and in an address to the new government Maduro made an overture of friendship to the U.S. President saying, \"Mr. Donald Trump, here is my hand.\" It seems Donald Trump is keen to respond not with an open palm or even an arm-jerking handshake, but a fist.\n\n\"We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary,\" the President told reporters from his New Jersey golf vacation. As reporter Joyce Karam pointed out, Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, looked intently worried during Trump's declaration.\n\nPundits were quick to leap on Trump's extreme suggestion of sending in U.S. forces when he's already in a game of chicken with North Korea after threatening \"fire and fury\" and bragging about how U.S. missiles are ready to go at a moment's notice. But the Pentagon is trying to reassure Americans that no military action has been officially ordered -- yet.\n\nInstead, the first response was a package of sanctions against the Maduro regime, which the Trump administration is treating as a dictatorship. But it doesn't bode well that Trump has already leaped to violent rhetoric before the State Department has had a chance to do its job. In fact, State Department alum Eric Farnesworth, who is currently leads the Council of the Americas, tweeted that, in his experience, getting this aggressive so early on is \"unwise even if true goal is serious econ sanctions as a sort of middle ground.\"\n\nOther experts weighed, in too. CNN's Pentagon Correspondent and NPR's Chief International Editor both thought that this actually gives Maduro the upper hand. The former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta wasn't thrilled, either. After all, if Trump chooses to go into Venezuela, that wouldn't exactly be the first time that the U.S. got involved in Venezuelan politics. The George W. Bush administration and the CIA were tied to a failed coup there in 2002. Not to mention all that business with the death squads in the 1980s.\n\nAs Maduro has consolidated power, the Bol\u00edvar currency has plummeted below the worth of World of War Craft gold and citizens have been scavenging for food -- when they aren't being disappeared.

threat\" to consider military action against Venezuela, Caracas said on Saturday, after its military vowed to stand up to the US leader's \"craziness.\"\n\nThe warning from Trump on Friday that his administration was mulling many options, \"including a possible military option if necessary,\" struck the government of Venezuela's beleaguered leftist president, Nicolas Maduro, like a thunderbolt.\n\nThe leadership of the crisis-wracked nation -- Latin America's biggest oil producer and an ally to Russia and Cuba -- suddenly found itself going from battling dissent, protests and growing international isolation to contemplating US military action last seen in the region in 1989, when American troops invaded Panama to topple its president, Manuel Noriega.\n\n\"The reckless threat by President Donald Trump aims to drag Latin America and the Caribbean into a conflict that would permanently alter stability, peace and security in our region,\" Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told a news conference, reading a statement in Maduro's name.\n\nThe menace, however, also gave Maduro's regime an unexpected opportunity to substantiate its daily refrain that it is a victim of a Washington plot to grab control of its oil reserves, the biggest in the world.\n\nThe military, current and retired members of which control a third of the government, leapt on the threat to say it was the nation's only bulwark against the \"imperialist aggression.\"\n\nGeneral Vladimir Padrino, Venezuela's defense minister and commander of its armed forces, on Friday called Trump's threat \"an act of craziness.\"\n\n\"I am certain that we will all be in the first ranks defending the interests and sovereignty of our beloved Venezuela,\" he said.\n\n- 'Vile threats' -\n\nTrump had said the military option was among a range of scenarios he was considering to fix the \"very dangerous mess\" in Venezuela.\n\nHe has already had his government impose sanctions on Maduro -- an extremely rare step against a head of state -- and two dozen of his officials.\n\nThey were for perceived moves towards a \"dictatorship\" in Venezuela, especially through Maduro's establishment this month of a new, all-powerful assembly filled with loyalists that has powers to override the country's legislature, controlled by the opposition.\n\nThe head of that new Constituent Assembly, Delcy Rodriguez, said on Twitter: \"We reject the cowardly, insolent and vile threats against the sacred sovereignty of Venezuela.\"\n\nThe assembly was elected two weeks ago in a vote marred by allegations of fraud, an opposition boycott and violent protests and repression by security forces that brought the death toll in four months of unrest to more than 125.\n\nSince starting work, the assembly -- ostensibly tasked with rewriting the constitution -- has fired Venezuela's attorney general who had become a major critic of Maduro, and stepped up measures to quash opposition politicians.\n\nThe supreme court, which has also shown itself consistently loyal to Maduro, stripped two opposition mayors of the right to public office and ordered them to jail, bringing to 23 the number targeted by legal action.\n\n- Regional unease -\n\nThe developments have prompted major Latin American nations Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Peru to slam Maduro's government for \"breaking democratic rule.\"\n\nPeru on Friday ordered Venezuela's ambassador to leave, with Caracas reacting by ordering out Lima's envoy.\n\nBut not all of Latin America is ranged against Maduro. Venezuela can still count on support from leftist allies Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua, as well as a handful of Caribbean nations that depend on it for cheap or free oil.\n\nThe prospect of US military action in a region that has very bitter memories of multiple such interventions last century has stirred unease even among countries opposed to Venezuela.\n\nUS Vice President Mike Pence will on Sunday begin a Latin American visit -- a trip seen as coordinating action between Washington and regional powers against Venezuela.\n\nBrazil on Saturday said it and the other members of the South American trading bloc Mercosur -- from which Venezuela was suspended indefinitely days ago -- rejected the threat of force.\n\n\"The repudiation of violence and whatever option involving the use of force is resolute and constitutes a fundamental basis of democratic cohabitation, both in domestic contexts as well as in international relations,\" Brazil's foreign ministry said in a statement.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-12T18:03:00Z", "sim": 0, "source": {"uri": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "title": "sg.news.yahoo.com", "id": "18491"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "08:41:00", "url": "https://sg.news.yahoo.com/venezuela-says-latin-america-stability-risk-reckless-trump-185612810.html", "storyUri": "eng-3356011", "id": "8891461", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.t5FC7CJfiVILEoHiw6Cjg--/aD01MTM7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_sg/News/AFP/9d8f45cf4c06d0bd16a39c3c350d641aaab56c20.jpg", "date": "2017-08-12", "time": "18:03:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

Donald Trump hat mit seiner milit\u00e4rischen Drohung gegen das krisengesch\u00fcttelte Venezuela in ganz Lateinamerika Befremden ausgel\u00f6st. Verb\u00fcndete sowie Kritiker des linken Pr\u00e4sidenten Nicol\u00e1s Maduro wiesen eine Intervention zur\u00fcck. \"Jetzt wei\u00df die Welt: Jene, die gegen Maduro sind, streben nur ein milit\u00e4risches Eingreifen des Imperiums an\", sagte Boliviens Pr\u00e4sident Evo Morales, ein enger Verb\u00fcndeter Venezuelas.\n\nLauter Milliard\u00e4re: Geldscheine w\u00e4hrend der Hyperinflation 1923 Mit Hammer und Zirkel: Die bis 1989 g\u00fcltigen DDR-Geldscheine Geheime Scheine: Diese DM-Banknoten hatten wir nie im Geldbeutel\n\nMit Kolumbien, Mexiko und Peru verurteilten aber auch die sch\u00e4rfsten Kritiker von Maduros sozialistischer Regierung das S\u00e4belrasseln von Trump. \"Wir lehnen milit\u00e4rische Mittel und Gewaltanwendung im internationalen System ab\", teilte das kolumbianische Au\u00dfenministerium am Wochenende mit.\n\nAngesichts der Krise in Venezuela hatte Trump \u00fcberraschend eine milit\u00e4rische Option ins Gespr\u00e4ch gebracht. \"Wir haben viele Optionen f\u00fcr Venezuela, einschlie\u00dflich einer milit\u00e4rischen, falls n\u00f6tig\", sagte er am Freitag in seinem Urlaubsdomizil in Bedminster (New Jersey). Es war nicht unmittelbar klar, was Trump damit meinte.\n\nAnzeige - Heiz\u00f6lpreisrechner AnzeigeHeiz\u00f6lpreisrechner\n\nVenezuelas Pr\u00e4sident Maduro hatte zuletzt eine Verfassungsgebende Versammlung w\u00e4hlen lassen und damit das demokratisch gew\u00e4hlte Parlament faktisch entmachtet. Oppositionelle und zahlreiche Staaten werfen ihm vor, ein autorit\u00e4res Regierungssystem zu errichten.\n\nVon milit\u00e4rischen Planspielen oder auch nur konkreteren \u00dcberlegungen in Sachen Venezuela ist seitens der US-Regierung nichts bekannt. \"Das Pentagon hat keine Befehle erhalten\", zitierten Medien einen Sprecher des Verteidigungsministeriums. Venezuelas Verteidigungsminister Vladimir Padrino sagte zu Trumps Worten: \"Das ist ein verr\u00fcckter Akt, ein Akt des Extremismus.\"\n\nKritik an Trumps Drohung kamen auch aus den eigenen Reihen. \"Der Kongress wird nat\u00fcrlich keinem Krieg in Venezuela zustimmen\", sagte der republikanische Senator und einer von Trumps sch\u00e4rfsten innerparteilichen Kritikern, Ben Sasse, dem \"Washington Examiner\".\n\nVenezuelas Regierung warf den USA nach Trumps \u00c4u\u00dferungen imperialistische Bestrebungen vor und rief die lateinamerikanischen L\u00e4nder zur Solidarit\u00e4t auf. \"Das ist eine direkte Bedrohung des Friedens, der Stabilit\u00e4t, der Unabh\u00e4ngigkeit, der regionalen Einheit, der Souver\u00e4nit\u00e4t und des Rechts auf Selbstbestimmung\", sagte Au\u00dfenminister Jorge Arreaza.\n\nAnalysten kritisierten, Trump spiele mit seiner Kriegsrhetorik der sozialistischen Regierung von Maduro in die H\u00e4nde. Der venezolanische Pr\u00e4sident warnt seit Monaten vor Interventionspl\u00e4nen der USA und beschuldigt die Opposition, gemeinsam mit Washington gegen ihn zu konspirieren. Trumps \u00c4u\u00dferungen liefern nun einen scheinbaren Beweis f\u00fcr seine Anschuldigungen.\n\nKurz zuvor hatte sich Maduro noch um ein Gespr\u00e4ch mit Trump bem\u00fcht. Allerdings erteilte ihm das Wei\u00dfe Haus eine Abfuhr. \"Pr\u00e4sident Trump wird gerne mit dem F\u00fchrer Venezuelas sprechen, sobald die Demokratie in diesem Land wiederhergestellt ist\", hie\u00df es in der Erkl\u00e4rung.\n\nF\u00fcr Maduro ist die Abweisung und Ver\u00f6ffentlichung des ungew\u00f6hnlichen Vorgangs peinlich, weil sie ihn als Bittsteller dastehen l\u00e4sst. Trotz aller Differenzen sind die USA der wichtigste Abnehmer von Erd\u00f6l, ohne die Exporte in die USA droht die Staatspleite. Nach dem derzeitigen \u00d6lpreis importieren die USA f\u00fcr rund zehn Milliarden Dollar im Jahr \u00d6l aus dem am Rande des Ruins stehenden Landes.\n\nUS-Au\u00dfenminister Rex Tillerson hatte zuletzt wiederholt betont, keine Option in Bezug auf Venezuela sei ausgeschlossen - da ging es aber eher um die Frage nach einem Importstopp f\u00fcr \u00d6l aus Venezuela. Gegen mittlerweile \u00fcber 20 Personen der F\u00fchrungselite wurden Sanktionen verh\u00e4ngt, auch gegen Maduro. M\u00f6gliche Verm\u00f6gen und Konten, auf die US-Beh\u00f6rden Zugriff haben, werden eingefroren, US-B\u00fcrgern sind Gesch\u00e4fte mit den auf der Liste stehenden Personen verboten.\n\nUS-Finanzminister Steve Mnuchin hatte betont: \"Pr\u00e4sident Maduro hat diese illegitime Verfassungsgebende Versammlung vereidigt, um seine Diktatur weiter zu festigen.\" Maduro ist erst der vierte Staatschef, der von den USA mit Finanzsanktionen belegt wurde - nach Kim Jong Un (Nordkorea), Robert Mugabe (Simbabwe) und Baschar al-Assad (Syrien).", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3356011", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T13:55:00Z", "sim": 0.7215686440467834, "source": {"uri": "t-online.de", "title": "T-online.de", "id": "139"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "13:55:00", "url": "http://www.t-online.de/finanzen/boerse/news/id_81879982/wirtschaft-latinos-weisen-trumps-militaerische-option-gegen-venezuela-zurueck.html", "storyUri": "deu-753256", "id": "8923173", "image": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "13:55:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}], "page": 1, "totalResults": 702, "count": 1}}}

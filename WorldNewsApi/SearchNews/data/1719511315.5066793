I'm really that bitch. I really showed the world how to love yourself and not give a f--- to the point where these men in Colorado know who the f--- I am and put it on their cartoon that\u2019s been around for 25 years. I\u2019m literally that bitch, and I showed you how to not give a f--- and I\u2019m gonna continue showing you how not to give a f---.\u201d \"Oh, oh, oh, Lizzo! Bitch,\" she concluded, singing the jingle from the satirical ad.

In recent months Lizzo has been mired in controversy, after three of her former backup dancers filed a lawsuit against the artist, her production company, and her dance captain for alleged sexual harassment, weight-shaming, racial discrimination, and a \"hostile work environment.\" Lizzo has denied the accusations, saying in a statement last year, \"I am not here to be looked at as a victim, but I also know that I am not the villain... There is nothing I take more seriously than the respect we deserve as women in the world. I know what it feels like to be body-shamed on a daily basis and would absolutely never criticize or terminate an employee because of their weight. I'm hurt, but I will not let the good work I've done in the world be overshadowed by this.\" The dancers behind the suit called Lizzo's response \"disheartening.\u201d In February, a Los Angeles judge rejected Lizzo's request to drop the case, though some of the allegations were dismissed, including one dancer's claims of being fat-shamed.

But eyebrows and tempers rise when the fight turns inward.\n\nThat is precisely what is happening now in rural Vernon County, Missouri, some 90 minutes south of Kansas City, where the Vernon County Republican Committee is headed to circuit court on Tuesday against the county clerk -- a Republican -- over who gets to determine who runs for office and call themselves a Republican.\n\nAs fights go, this one has turned nasty.\n\nLeading the charge on one side is Cyndia Haggard, a self-described pro-Trump, MAGA Republican and election denier who in 2023 appealed to the court for clemency for a Vernon County man convicted of breaking into the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2020, dressed in a Revolutionary War costume.\n\n\"One hundred percent,\" Haggard told The Star last week, \"the 2020 election was stolen.\"\n\nThe chairwoman of the county's Republican Committee, Haggard is also president of another organization, the Republican Association of Central Committees of MO, which holds that too many \"fake Republicans\" or RINOS (Republicans in name only) are being allowed to run for office under the Republican banner.\n\n\"RINOs,\" the organization's website states beneath a photo of a rhinoceros in a suit, \"are like a virus that infects & destroys our party's values.\"\n\nAs such, the group has been promoting extensive vetting of prospective candidates before they are allowed -- by a county's Republican party committee -- to run as a Republican. The vetting includes a 25-question \"values survey\" to be graded on a pass/fail basis.\n\n\"We are at war to save our party,\" says the group's website, which bears Haggard's name. \"That's not an overstatement.\n\n\"Legislators ignore us. They kowtow to lobbyist interests. Fake Republicans have filed under the Republican banner for years. No one in the Republican leadership says a word. No one stops them. WE. WILL.\"\n\nBecause the case on Tuesday involves Vernon County officials, it is being heard before Judge Gayle L. Crane of Jasper County Circuit Court. The scope of the case is narrow. It does not directly involve the issue of vetting, per se, but it does center on who has the right to determine who can run as a Republican candidate.\n\nRepublicans take Republicans to court\n\nIn March, the Vernon County Republican Committee filed what is known as a writ of mandamus through their attorney, Mark McCloskey, to, in effect, compel the Vernon County clerk, Adrienne Lee, to do what they believe to be her public duty.\n\nMcClosky, a personal injury lawyer, is popular in conservative circles as a podcast host. In 2020, he and his wife, Patricia, gained instant notoriety when, during the Black Lives Matter protests, they emerged from their affluent St. Louis home brandishing weapons to ostensibly project themselves from the protesters.\n\nIn the filing, the plaintiff maintains that, just like a club is allowed to determine who its members are, the Vernon County Republican Committee is \"solely responsible\" in the county for determining who may run for office under the Republican banner.\n\nThe county clerk, they insist, went beyond her authority when, in February, she took the filing fees from several candidates who were rejected by the committee and told them that their names would be placed on the Republican primary ballot in August.\n\nFour individuals were initially named in the suit. All are current Republican office holders: Vernon County Administrator Kelsey Westerhold, County Treasurer Brent Barnes, County Assessor Lena Kleeman and Rich Hill Police Chief Michael Buehler, running forcounty sheriff. All refused to go through the committee's vetting process. Four others have since been added to the suit.\n\nThe committee's interpretation of state law is that, while the county clerk can take a filing fee, those checks are then passed on to the party committees. They argue that it is ultimately up to a the political parties -- Republican or Democrat -- whether to accept or reject those fees and accept or reject any particular candidate. In this case, they did not accept those candidates and did not cash their checks. Thus the candidates' names should be taken off the ballot, the committee argued.\n\n\"The whole purpose of the vetting program is to verify that people who run as Republicans adhere to Republican values and principle and aren't merely putting an 'R' behind their name so they can get elected,\" McCloskey told The Star. \"We believe the courts have backed us up -- that a party should have the exclusive right to determine who gets to run under that party's banner.\"\n\nThe litigation, Haggard said, \"is about one thing only: Did the county clerk overstep her authority by putting people on the ballot that we have rejected?\"\n\n'What the law is'\n\nTravis Elliott, w ith the Springfield firm Ellis, Ellis, Hammons & Johnson, is representing the county clerk. He argues that she followed the law. She did her job. The prospective candidates submitted their fee to the court and, per state law, she forwarded them to the central committee.\n\n\"We are not talking about what the law should be, we're talking about what the law is,\" he said. \"Our position is basically that the county clerk is in the position of wanting there to be free and fair elections, not taking sides, and there being integrity in the election process.\"\n\nIn Vernon County's political corners, the issue of a small committee controlling the process is being met with great umbrage.\n\n\"I can tell you that I'm very against it,\" said Shelly Baldwin, a Republican in her second term as Vernon County recorder. \"Every elected official is against it. ... They're dictating who can and can't run. She (Haggard) tells you that that's not true. I mean, you have to go take a survey, she calls it. But it's a test, because you have to pass it. I don't know of any other survey you have to pass.\n\n\"She picks and chooses who she has on the committee. They didn't even get elected to those positions.\"\n\nSome worry over the makeup of the committee, noting that one member is Dan Gayman, whom the Anti-Defamation League identified as the leader of the Church of Israel, based in Schell City.\n\n\"He has popularized the 'two seedline' theory ... which purports that Jews descend from a sexual union between Eve and Satan (only white Christians descend from Adam and Eve),\" the Anti-Defamation League has stated for years. \"He has been credited with inspiring such groups and figures as The Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord ... and Eric Rudolph, who pleaded guilty to bombing three abortion clinics, a gay nightclub, and the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.\"\n\nOn its website, the church's mission statement says that among its immediate goals: \"To Call the Covenant People of Jehovah God to repentance! ... To promote the increase of spiritual strength and physical size of the Christian family. To encourage large families, home birthing, Christian education, moral and ethnic purity, and obedience to the commandments and other laws of the Living God.\"\n\nHaggard confirmed that members of the Church of Israel are part of the committee, but argues that any members' religious affiliation is not relevant to their work with the Vernon County Republican Party.\n\n\"There have been a lot of hit pieces leveled at us from those who don't want vetting and think it's OK to just be vicious and hateful toward individuals or religions or whatever,\" Haggard said. \"We do have people on our committee from that church. We also have people on our committee from the Catholic Church.\n\n\"I'm sure you know the Catholic Church has a pedophile problem. So is that a problem for us? I get real resentful real fast when people start tying to say, 'Well, this religion is OK and that religion isn't.' I don't belong to any church. But I support the First Amendment right of everyone to have freedom of religion.\n\n\"I typically tell people who get angry or hateful about the Church of Israel, 'Why don't you just give me a list of approved churches or religions.' Catholics got this pedophile thing. There's people who don't like Baptists. So should we excommunicate them from our committee as well?\"\n\nVetting candidates\n\nHaggard also argues that the vetting does not keep anyone from running for office, it just keeps certain individuals from running as Republicans. Others can run as Democrats, independents or under any other party affiliation.\n\n\"It's not going away,\" she said of vetting.\n\nStatewide, some 300 Republicans seeking office have either agreed to or sought out vetting. The Republican Association of Central Committees of MO website lists an array of \"Republican Values Approved Vetted 2024\" candidates for multiple state offices, including governor.\n\nGubernatorial candidate Jay Ashcroft, Missouri's current secretary of state, has been vetted by the group, as have candidates Chris Wright and Bill Eigel, a Missouri state senator, who last year made national headlines after a video of him handling a flamethrower at a fundraiser went viral.\n\n\"In the video, I am taking a flame thrower to cardboard boxes representing what I am going to do to the leftist policies and RINO corruption of the Jeff City swamp,\" Eigel told The Star at the time. \"But let's be clear, you bring those woke pornographic books to Missouri schools to try to brainwash our kids, and I'll burn those too -- on the front lawn of the governor's mansion.\"", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Thus the candidates' names should be taken off the ballot, the committee argued.\n\n\"The whole purpose of the vetting program is to verify that people who run as Republicans adhere to Republican values and principles and aren't merely putting an 'R' behind their name so they can get elected,\" McCloskey told The Star. \"We believe the courts have backed us up -- that a party should have the exclusive right to determine who gets to run under that party's banner.\"\n\nThe litigation, Haggard said, \"is about one thing only: Did the county clerk overstep her authority by putting people on the ballot that we have rejected?\"\n\n'What the law is'\n\nTravis Elliott, with the Springfield firm Ellis, Ellis, Hammons & Johnson, is representing the county clerk. He argues that she followed the law. She did her job. The prospective candidates submitted their fee to the court and, per state law, she forwarded them to the central committee.\n\n\"We are not talking about what the law should be, we're talking about what the law is,\" he said. \"Our position is basically that the county clerk is in the position of wanting there to be free and fair elections, not taking sides, and there being integrity in the election process.\"\n\nIn Vernon County's political corners, the issue of a small committee controlling the process is being met with great umbrage.\n\n\"I can tell you that I'm very against it,\" said Shelly Baldwin, a Republican in her second term as Vernon County recorder. \"Every elected official is against it. ... They're dictating who can and can't run. She (Haggard) tells you that that's not true. I mean, you have to go take a survey, she calls it. But it's a test, because you have to pass it. I don't know of any other survey you have to pass.\n\n\"She picks and chooses who she has on the committee. They didn't even get elected to those positions.\"\n\nSome worry over the makeup of the committee, noting that one member is Dan Gayman, whom the Anti-Defamation League identified as the leader of the Church of Israel, based in Schell City.\n\n\"He has popularized the 'two seedline' theory ... which purports that Jews descend from a sexual union between Eve and Satan (only white Christians descend from Adam and Eve),\" the ADL has stated for years. \"He has been credited with inspiring such groups and figures as The Covenant, the Sword and the Arm of the Lord ... and Eric Rudolph, who pleaded guilty to bombing three abortion clinics, a gay nightclub, and the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.\"\n\nOn its website, the church's mission statement says that among its immediate goals: \"To Call the Covenant People of Jehovah God to repentance! ... To promote the increase of spiritual strength and physical size of the Christian family. To encourage large families, home birthing, Christian education, moral and ethnic purity, and obedience to the commandments and other laws of the Living God.\"\n\nHaggard confirmed that members of the Church of Israel are part of the committee, but argues that any members' religious affiliation is not relevant to their work with the Vernon County Republican Party.\n\n\"There have been a lot of hit pieces leveled at us from those who don't want vetting and think it's OK to just be vicious and hateful toward individuals or religions or whatever,\" Haggard said. \"We do have people on our committee from that church. We also have people on our committee from the Catholic Church.\"\n\n\"I'm sure you know the Catholic Church has a pedophile problem. So is that a problem for us? I get real resentful real fast when people start trying to say, 'Well, this religion is OK and that religion isn't.' I don't belong to any church. But I support the First Amendment right of everyone to have freedom of religion.\n\n\"I typically tell people who get angry or hateful about the Church of Israel, 'Why don't you just give me a list of approved churches or religions.' Catholics got this pedophile thing. There's people who don't like Baptists. So should we excommunicate them from our committee as well?\"\n\nVetting candidates\n\nHaggard also argues that the vetting does not keep anyone from running for office, it just keeps certain individuals from running as Republicans. Others can run as Democrats, independents or under any other party affiliation.\n\n\"It's not going away,\" she said of vetting.\n\nStatewide, some 300 Republicans seeking office have either agreed to or sought out vetting. The Republican Association of Central Committees of MO website lists an array of \"Republican Values Approved Vetted 2024\" candidates for multiple state offices, including governor.\n\nGubernatorial candidate Jay Ashcroft, Missouri's current secretary of state, has been vetted by the group, as have candidates Chris Wright and Bill Eigel, a Missouri state senator, who last year made national headlines after a video of him handling a flamethrower at a fundraiser went viral.\n\n\"In the video, I am taking a flame thrower to cardboard boxes representing what I am going to do to the leftist policies and RINO corruption of the Jeff City swamp,\" Eigel told The Star at the time. \"But let's be clear, you bring those woke pornographic books to Missouri schools to try to brainwash our kids, and I'll burn those too -- on the front lawn of the governor's mansion.\"\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [],

In a ruling, Jasper County Circuit Judge Gayle Crane sided with the Vernon County Republican Central Committee and against against Vernon County Clerk Adrienne Lee, effectively ordering her to remove eight candidates from the Aug. 6 primary ballot.\n\nAt the core of the lawsuit was the question of whether Lee performed all her ministerial duties as a clerk by placing on the ballot the eight candidates who had failed to go through the Republican vetting process.\n\nIntroduced late last year, the vetting process aims to weed out candidates who want to run as Republicans merely to win votes in majority red counties. The vetting process is proctored and includes an \"objective review\" of each candidate's background, a 25-question multiple choice \"values survey\" based on party positions and requires candidates to sign a statement pledging their allegiance to both the state and federal Republican Party platforms and constitutions.\n\nIncumbents and those who have held office in the past have their voting records reviewed. Survey questions are not shared with central committees that are considering or have already adopted the vetting process. Over 300 candidates, including state candidates who volunteered, have been vetted.\n\nThe vetting process was created by the Republican Association of Central Committees for Missouri, or REPACCMO. The organization is led by the Vernon County Republican Central Committee Chairwoman Cyndia Haggard through whom the lawsuit was filed.\n\nAt trial, and in Crane's order, the main focus fell on RSMo. 115.357, the state statute related to candidate filings and filing fees. This statute outlines that filing fees should be paid to the central committee, may be paid to the official accepting candidacy declaration and that no candidate should appear on the ballot if their fees were not paid.\n\nWhile the filing fees were filed by candidates with the clerk, she forwarded them to the central committee's treasurer. The fees were never deposited by the treasurer because the candidates were not vetted, and therefore Lee never received receipts for the filing fees.\n\nCrane asserts that Lee failed to perform her duties as a clerk by accepting declaration of candidacy before receiving receipt of filing fees for the eight candidates from the committee.\n\nDuring the trial at Vernon County Circuit Court on Tuesday, Travis Elliott, an attorney representing Lee, argued the statute does not lay out the ministerial duties when fees are returned, and instead a past Missouri Supreme Court ruling notes county candidates are able to file their fees with the clerk in addition to the central committee.\n\nThe ruling orders the clerk to remove the eight candidates who failed to pass the vetting process, including four incumbents. With the removal of these candidates, two county seats will not have any candidates on the ballot and the sheriff, assessor and southern commissioner races will have just one candidate each.\n\nOther counties where the vetting process has been adopted have been watching this lawsuit unfold to consider how to move forward with other ballots that may currently include unvetted candidates, including Christian County.\n\nMore: Republican vetting process sets stage for lawsuits, leaves MO primary ballots uncertain\n\nThere is still time for the decision to be appealed, though would have to be done so quickly due to the nature of elections and finalization of primary ballots.

Starting more than an hour late, the arguments drew a throng of spectators, with the case expected to set precedent for the role the newly introduced vetting process could play in Missouri politics.\n\nIntroduced late last year, the vetting process aims to weed out candidates who want to run as Republicans merely to win votes in majority red counties. The vetting process is proctored and includes an \"objective review\" of each candidate's background, a 25-question multiple choice \"values survey\" based on party positions and requires candidates to sign a statement pledging their allegiance to both the state and federal Republican Party platforms and constitutions.\n\nIncumbents and those who have held office in the past have their voting records reviewed. Survey questions are not shared with central committees that are considering or have already adopted the vetting process. Over 300 candidates, including state candidates who volunteered, have been vetted.\n\nThe vetting process was developed by the Republican Association of Central Committees for Missouri, or REPACCMO. The nonprofit organization was created in October by Cyndia Haggard, the chair of the Vernon County Republican Central Committee, who now leads the organization.\n\nThrough the lawsuit filed in March, the Vernon County Republican Central Committee seeks to remove eight Republican candidates from the ballot whose fees were not accepted by the central committee because of their failure to pass through the vetting process. The core of the case revolves around whether Lee, the county clerk, failed to carry out her ministerial duties or extended her ministerial duties as a county clerk.\n\nLong wait, short hearing\n\nFor more than an hour, current county officials, candidates and those from the central committee waited outside the courtroom doors for the trial that was scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. Tuesday. The delay was a result of the respective parties coming to an agreement on documents to submit as evidence, including filing fee checks, receipts and letters sent to the clerk, rather than arguing them live. Despite the long wait, the actual arguments in the case took only about half an hour.\n\nThe central committee was represented by Mark McCloskey, an attorney who attracted national attention after he and his wife pointed guns at protestors from the front yard of their home in St. Louis in 2020.\n\nSpeaking in front of Jasper County Circuit Judge Gayle Crane, McCloskey argued the clerk violated state statute by allowing candidates whose filing fees were returned by the central committee to still be listed on the ballot. He focused on three particular subsections of RSMo. 115.357 related to candidate filings and filing fees.\n\nThe subsections note candidates \"shall\" pay filing fees to the central committee treasurer, that the required fee may be submitted to the authority accepting declaration of candidacy (in this case the clerk) and that no candidate's name shall appear on the ballot until fees are paid.\n\nMcCloskey said that because the filing fees were never deposited by the committee's treasurer, they were essentially not paid and should therefore not appear on the ballot. With the difference in language between \"shall\" and \"may,\" McCloskey noted the legislation establishes that the two subsections are different and the role of the clerk is simply to forward fees to the treasurer.\n\n\"Legislature doesn't put in words to have no meaning,\" he said.\n\nBecause Lee was informed ahead of time of at least five candidates that the central committee would not accept filing fees from, McCloskey argued she should not have accepted their candidacy.\n\nThere is no case law that directly deals with the issue at hand, although a 2018 Missouri Supreme Court case, Curtis v. Missouri Democratic Party, et al. comes close. The case differs from the current argument in that it deals with a state candidate's candidacy who never actually filed the fee.\n\nGuided by state statute\n\nTravis Elliott, attorney with Springfield law firm Ellis, Ellis, Hammons & Johnson, represented Lee in the case and argued that the Curtis case does pertain to the question in Vernon County, if the secretary of state's role in the previous case is replaced with county clerk. He pointed to the court's opinion issued, by Judge Patricia Breckenridge, that states: \"Section 115.357 provides two methods by which a candidate can tender this required filing fee.\" Those two methods being either with the central committee or the candidacy authority.\n\nThe state statute was revised in 202 but the revision only pertained to state candidates, who are now required to file their fees with the party treasurer instead of having the option of filing with the secretary of state. This explicit revision highlights the legislature's goal of giving county candidates the option, Elliott argued.\n\nHe also noted that the county clerk's ministerial duties are laid out in state statute, and that the central committee does not have the authority to create any additional duties.\n\n\"She did exactly what the law required her,\" Elliott said, adding that state statute does not say anything about the details of filing fee checks being returned.\n\nHowever, McCloskey said they are not imposing any new duties but rather enforcing the statute that Lee violated by placing candidates whose fees were not accepted on the ballot.\n\nTight deadline for impactful decisions\n\nCrane said she will make her ruling on the case by 10 a.m. this Friday. If the judge rules in favor of the central committee and orders the clerk to remove the eight candidates, two county seats will not have any candidates on the ballot and the sheriff, assessor and southern commissioner races will have just one candidate each. Four of the people subject to removal are incumbents.\n\nCindy Thompson, one of the incumbents subject to removal, tried to join the lawsuit. However, at an earlier hearing, Crane denied her intervention because the case argued at court is not directly about candidates appearing on the ballot but Lee's role as a clerk.\n\nMore: Republican vetting process sets stage for lawsuits, leaves MO primary ballots uncertain\n\nThe decision could still be appealed, though with the nature of elections the timeline of any appeal proceedings would be tight. The court's authority to change the Aug. 6 primary election expires on June 11, meaning all court proceedings would have to be wrapped up by then. The result of this case carries a lot of weight as other counties where the vetting process has been adopted and ballots are in dispute look to the Vernon County lawsuit for answers.", "source":

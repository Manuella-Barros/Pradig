Prosecutors described him as one of the most violent members of the mob of Donald Trump supporters that attacked the Capitol as lawmakers met to certify Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory.\n\nDempsey, who is from Van Nuys, stomped on police officers' heads. He swung poles at officers defending a tunnel, struck an officer in the head with a metal crutch and attacked police with pepper spray and broken pieces of furniture, prosecutors said.\n\nHe climbed atop other rioters, using them like \"human scaffolding\" to reach officers guarding a tunnel entrance. He injured at least two police officers, prosecutors said.\n\n\"Your conduct on January 6th was exceptionally egregious,\" U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth told Dempsey. \"You did not get carried away in the moment.\"\n\nDempsey pleaded guilty in January to two counts of assaulting police officers with a dangerous weapon.\n\nOnly former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio has received a longer sentence in the Jan. 6 attack. Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years for orchestrating a plot to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Joe Biden after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDempsey called his conduct \"reprehensible\" and apologized to the police officers whom he assaulted,\n\n\"You were performing your duties, and I responded with hostility and violence,\" he said before learning his sentence.\n\nJustice Department prosecutors recommended a prison sentence of 21 years and 10 months for Dempsey, a former construction worker and fast-food restaurant employee. Dempsey's violence was so extreme that he attacked a fellow rioter who was trying to disarm him, prosecutors wrote.\n\n\"David Dempsey is political violence personified,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Brasher told the judge.\n\nDefence attorney Amy Collins, who sought a sentence of six years and six months, described the government's sentencing recommendation as \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"It makes him a statistic,\" she said. \"It doesn't consider the person he is, how much he has grown.\"\n\nDempsey was wearing a tactical vest, a helmet and an American flag gaiter covering his face when he attacked police at a tunnel leading to the Lower West Terrace doors. He shot pepper spray at Metropolitan Police Department Detective Phuson Nguyen just as another rioter yanked at the officer's gas mask, prosecutors wrote.\n\n\"The searing spray burned Detective Nguyen's lungs, throat, eyes, and face and left him gasping for breath, fearing he might lose consciousness and be overwhelmed by the mob,\" they wrote.\n\nDempsey then struck MPD Sgt. Jason Mastony in the head with a metal crutch, cracking the shield on his gas mask and cutting his head.\n\n\"I collapsed and caught myself against the wall as my ears rang. I was able to stand again and hold the line for a few more minutes until another assault by rioters pushed the police line back away from the threshold of the tunnel,\" Mastony said in a statement submitted to the court.\n\nDempsey has been jailed since his arrest in August 2021.\n\nHis criminal record in California includes convictions for burglary, theft and assault. The assault conviction stemmed from an October 2019, gathering near the Santa Monica Pier, where Dempsey attacked people peacefully demonstrating against then-president Trump, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The peaceful protest turned violent as Dempsey took a canister of bear spray from his pants and dispersed it at close range against several protesters,\" they wrote, noting that Dempsey was sentenced to 200 days of jail time.\n\nDempsey engaged in at least three other acts of \"vicious political violence\" that didn't lead to criminal charges \"for various reasons,\" according to prosecutors. They said Dempsey struck a counter-protester over the head with a skateboard at a June 2019 rally in Los Angeles, used the same skateboard to assault someone at an August 2020 protest in Tujunga, California, and attacked a protester with pepper spray and a metal bat during a August 2020 protest in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nMore than 1,400 people have been charged with Jan. 6-related federal crimes. Over 900 of them have been convicted and sentenced, with roughly two-thirds receiving terms of imprisonment ranging from a few days to the 22 years that Tarrio received.", "source": {"uri":

Prosecutors described him as one of the most violent members of the mob of Donald Trump supporters that attacked the Capitol as lawmakers met to certify Joe Biden's 2020 presidential election victory.\n\nDempsey, who is from Van Nuys, stomped on police officers' heads. He swung poles at officers defending a tunnel, struck an officer in the head with a metal crutch and attacked police with pepper spray and broken pieces of furniture, prosecutors said.\n\nHe climbed atop other rioters, using them like \"human scaffolding\" to reach officers guarding a tunnel entrance. He injured at least two police officers, prosecutors said.\n\n\"Your conduct on January 6th was exceptionally egregious,\" U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth told Dempsey. \"You did not get carried away in the moment.\"\n\nDempsey pleaded guilty in January to two counts of assaulting police officers with a dangerous weapon.\n\nOnly former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio has received a longer sentence in the Jan. 6 attack. Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years for orchestrating a plot to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Joe Biden after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDempsey called his conduct \"reprehensible\" and apologized to the police officers whom he assaulted,\n\n\"You were performing your duties, and I responded with hostility and violence,\" he said before learning his sentence.\n\nJustice Department prosecutors recommended a prison sentence of 21 years and 10 months for Dempsey, a former construction worker and fast-food restaurant employee. Dempsey's violence was so extreme that he attacked a fellow rioter who was trying to disarm him, prosecutors wrote.\n\n\"David Dempsey is political violence personified,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Brasher told the judge.\n\nDefense attorney Amy Collins, who sought a sentence of 6 years and six months, described the government's sentencing recommendation as \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"It makes him a statistic,\" she said. \"It doesn't consider the person he is, how much he has grown.\"\n\nDempsey was wearing a tactical vest, a helmet and an American flag gaiter covering his face when he attacked police at a tunnel leading to the Lower West Terrace doors. He shot pepper spray at Metropolitan Police Department Detective Phuson Nguyen just as another rioter yanked at the officer's gas mask.\n\n\"The searing spray burned Detective Nguyen's lungs, throat, eyes, and face and left him gasping for breath, fearing he might lose consciousness and be overwhelmed by the mob,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nDempsey then struck MPD Sgt. Jason Mastony in the head with a metal crutch, cracking the shield on his gas mask and cutting his head.\n\n\"I collapsed and caught myself against the wall as my ears rang. I was able to stand again and hold the line for a few more minutes until another assault by rioters pushed the police line back away from the threshold of the tunnel,\" Mastony said in a statement submitted to the court.\n\nDempsey has been jailed since his arrest in August 2021.\n\nHis criminal record in California includes convictions for burglary, theft and assault. The assault conviction stemmed from an October 2019, gathering near the Santa Monica Pier, where Dempsey attacked people peacefully demonstrating against then-President Donald Trump, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The peaceful protest turned violent as Dempsey took a canister of bear spray from his pants and dispersed it at close range against several protesters,\" they wrote, noting that Dempsey was sentenced to 200 days of jail time.\n\nDempsey engaged in at least three other acts of \"vicious political violence\" that didn't lead to criminal charges \"for various reasons,\" according to prosecutors. They said Dempsey struck a counter-protester over the head with a skateboard at a June 2019 rally in Los Angeles, used the same skateboard to assault someone at an August 2020 protest in Tujunga, California, and attacked a protester with pepper spray and a metal bat during a August 2020 protest in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nMore than 1,400 people have been charged with Jan. 6-related federal crimes. Over 900 of them have been convicted and sentenced, with roughly two-thirds receiving terms of imprisonment ranging from a few days to the 22 years that Tarrio received.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Lamberth has warned that \"such meritless justifications of criminal activity\" from politicians \"could presage further danger to our country.\"\n\nEchoing his language about the \"distortions and outright falsehoods\" that Republican politicians have promoted about Jan. 6, Lamberth said he was concerned that Dempsey had \"minimized\" his conduct that day and tried to come up with non-factual justifications for his behavior. Lamberth called Dempsey's behavior \"exceptionally egregious\" and said Dempsey was \"dressed for battle\" when he joined the mob trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power after President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\n\"You failed, fortunately, for our country,\" Lamberth said.\n\nHe added that Jan. 6 could have been even worse -- \"a bloodbath\" -- had rioters succeeded in their goal of getting to members of Congress who were certifying the presidential election results.\n\nWitnesses in court said that Dempsey, while being led out of court, appeared to flash an \"okay\" gesture with his fingers that has in recent years become a symbol of white supremacy and far-right causes.\n\nDempsey assaulted numerous officers on Jan. 6 but pleaded guilty specifically in connection with attacks on Washington Police Detective Phuson Nguyen, whom he hit with \"a torrent of pepper spray\" just after another rioter compromised Nguyen's mask, and Washington Police Sgt. Jason Mastony, who was hit so hard with a metal crutch that he collapsed in a daze and was left with a gash in his head, prosecutors wrote.\n\n\"Though Dempsey has pled guilty only for his assaults on Detective Nguyen and Sergeant Mastony, his violent assault on other officers defending the Capitol was relentless: swinging pole-like weapons more than 20 times, spraying chemical agents at least three times, hurling objects at officers at least ten times, stomping on the heads of police officers as he perched above them five times, attempting to steal a riot shield and baton, and incessantly hurling threats and insults at police while rallying other rioters to join his onslaught,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nBefore he assaulted officers, Dempsey stood in front of a gallows that had been set up near the Capitol, which included a sign that said, \"this is art.\" Dempsey, known to online sleuths as #FlagGaiterCopHater because of his American flag face covering and his assaults on officers, indicated he thought the gallows should be used to hang politicians he dubbed \"worthless cretins\" in video cited by prosecutors.\n\n\"String all these f---in' worthless bastards up from the top of those,\" he said in the video, pointing to the gallows, \"these treelines, the rafters, the rooftops, the statues, I don't care where they go. String 'em up and string 'em up high. And let everybody know this is what happens when you are a treasonous piece of s--- who doesn't belong in this f---in' country and has this f---in' country's worst objective at heart.\"\n\nDempsey was arrested in connection with the Capitol attack in August 2021 and had previously been charged in 2019 with dousing demonstrators in California with bear spray while he wore a \"Make America Great Again\" hat; he pleaded no contest in that case. He pleaded guilty in his Capitol attack case on Jan. 4.\n\nDempsey, who prosecutors say is a former construction worker and fast-food employee with a \"very significant history of arrests and convictions,\" was identified with the help of online sleuths who have aided the FBI in hundreds of cases against Jan. 6 rioters. Federal prosecutors say that in addition to assaulting anti-Trump protesters with bear spray in 2019, resulting in a two-year suspended sentence, he previously assaulted a counterprotester with a skateboard in a separate incident in 2019, used the same skateboard to assault another person at a political protest in 2020 and hit a person with a metal bat during another 2020 protest.\n\nMore than 1,400 people have been arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, and prosecutors have secured more than 1,000 convictions. Hundreds of defendants have received probationary sentences, but more than 560 defendants have been sentenced to periods of incarceration ranging from a few days behind bars to 22 years in federal prison.", "source": {"uri": "nbcbayarea.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Bay Area"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Lamberth", "type": "person",

Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years for orchestrating a plot to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump to Joe Biden after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nDempsey called his behavior \"reprehensible\" and apologized to the police officers he attacked.\n\n\"You performed your duties and I responded with hostility and violence,\" he said before hearing his sentence.\n\nJustice Department prosecutors recommended a prison sentence of 21 years and 10 months for Dempsey, a former construction worker and fast-food restaurant employee. Dempsey's violence was so extreme that he attacked a fellow rioter who tried to disarm him, prosecutors wrote.\n\n\"David Dempsey is the personification of political violence,\" Assistant District Attorney Douglas Brasher told the judge.\n\nDefense attorney Amy Collins, who asked for a sentence of six years and six months, described the government's sentencing recommendation as \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"It makes him a statistic,\" she said. \"It doesn't take into account the person he is, how much he's grown.\"\n\nDempsey was wearing a tactical vest, a helmet and an American flag gaiter covering his face when he charged at police in a tunnel leading to the Lower West Terrace doors. He fired pepper spray at Metropolitan Police Department Detective Phuson Nguyen just as another rioter pulled on the officer's gas mask.\n\n\"The flaming spray burned Detective Nguyen's lungs, throat, eyes and face, leaving him gasping for air as he feared he would lose consciousness and be overwhelmed by the crowd,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nDempsey then struck MPD Sgt. Jason Mastony in the head with a metal crutch, breaking the shield of his gas mask and injuring his head.\n\n\"I collapsed and clenched myself against the wall with my ears ringing. I was able to get back up and hold the line for a few more minutes until another attack by rioters pushed the police line back from the threshold of the tunnel,\" Mastony said in a statement filed in court.\n\nDempsey has been in custody since his arrest in August 2021.\n\nHis criminal record in California includes convictions for burglary, theft and assault. The assault conviction stems from an October 2019 rally at the Santa Monica Pier, where Dempsey attacked people peacefully demonstrating against then-President Donald Trump, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The peaceful protest turned violent when Dempsey pulled a can of bear spray from his pants and fired it at several protesters at close range,\" they wrote, noting that Dempsey was sentenced to 200 days in jail.\n\nDempsey was involved in at least three other acts of \"vicious political violence\" that did not result in criminal charges \"for various reasons,\" prosecutors said. They said Dempsey struck a counterprotester in the head with a skateboard during a June 2019 rally in Los Angeles, used the same skateboard to attack someone during an August 2020 protest in Tujunga, California, and attacked a protester with pepper spray and a metal baton during an August 2020 protest in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nMore than 1,400 people have been charged with federal crimes related to January 6. More than 900 have been convicted and sentenced, with about two-thirds receiving prison sentences ranging from a few days to the 22 years Tarrio received.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com",

Dempsey, who has a prior history of political violence, carried out repeated and aggressive attacks using flagpoles and other improvised weapons against law enforcement officers who were defending the Capitol as a mob of Donald Trump supporters stormed the building.\n\nDempsey's sentence is one of the longest handed down in connection with the Capitol riot, highlighting the severity of his actions. Prosecutors described him as among the most violent participants in the mob, which had converged on the Capitol as lawmakers were certifying Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nHailing from Van Nuys, Dempsey was involved in a series of violent encounters during the riot. He stomped on the heads of police officers, swung poles at them, struck one officer in the head with a metal crutch, and used pepper spray and broken furniture to attack the officers defending a tunnel entrance. At one point, he even climbed over other rioters, using them as \"human scaffolding\" to reach officers, injuring at least two of them.\n\nAlso Read: China Imposes Sanctions On US lawmaker; He Calls It \"A Badge Of Honor\"\n\n\"Your conduct on January 6 was exceptionally egregious,\" U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth told Dempsey during the sentencing. \"You did not get carried away in the moment.\"\n\nDempsey had pleaded guilty in January to two counts of assaulting police officers with a dangerous weapon. His sentence is only surpassed by that of former Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who received 22 years for orchestrating a plot to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after the 2020 election.\n\nIn court, Dempsey expressed remorse for his actions, calling his behavior \"reprehensible\" and apologizing to the officers he had assaulted. \"You were performing your duties, and I responded with hostility and violence,\" he said before his sentence was announced.\n\nDespite his apology, the prosecution emphasized the extreme nature of Dempsey's violence. The Justice Department had recommended a sentence of 21 years and 10 months, arguing that Dempsey's actions were so severe that he even attacked a fellow rioter who tried to disarm him. \"David Dempsey is political violence personified,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Brasher stated.\n\nDefense attorney Amy Collins, who sought a much lighter sentence of six years and six months, criticized the government's recommendation as \"ridiculous.\" She argued that it reduced Dempsey to a statistic without considering his personal growth and the person he had become.\n\nOn January 6, Dempsey was clad in tactical gear, including a vest, helmet, and an American flag gaiter covering his face, as he launched his attack on police officers guarding a tunnel leading to the lower west terrace doors. During the chaos, he pepper-sprayed Metropolitan Police Department Detective Phuson Nguyen, exacerbating the officer's struggle to breathe as another rioter pulled at his gas mask. Dempsey then struck Sergeant Jason Mastony in the head with a metal crutch, causing a significant injury.\n\n\"I collapsed and caught myself against the wall as my ears rang. I was able to stand again and hold the line for a few more minutes until another assault by rioters pushed the police line back away from the threshold of the tunnel,\" Mastony recalled in a statement submitted to the court.\n\nDempsey has been in custody since his arrest in August 2021. His criminal history in California includes convictions for burglary, theft, and assault. Notably, his assault conviction stemmed from an October 2019 incident near the Santa Monica Pier, where he attacked peaceful demonstrators protesting against then-President Trump by using bear spray.\n\nProsecutors also detailed other instances of Dempsey's \"vicious political violence\" that did not result in criminal charges. These included an attack on a counter-protester with a skateboard at a June 2019 rally in Los Angeles and assaults at protests in Tujunga and Beverly Hills in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsX"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.newsx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/National-61.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805409", "eventUri": "eng-9805409", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1410, "textEnd": 1419, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-10-", "textStart": 3791, "textEnd": 3803}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 4140, "textEnd": 4149}], "sentiment": -0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

His is among the longest Capitol riot sentences yet.\n\nA Donald Trump supporter who stood in front of a gallows and spoke of his desire to hang Democratic politicians before he assaulted numerous police officers during the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison Friday.\n\nIt's among the longest sentences handed out in a Jan. 6 case to date.\n\nProsecutors had sought more than 21 years (262 months) for David Dempsey, saying he \"viciously\" assaulted law enforcement officers at the lower west tunnel of the Capitol, where some of the worst violence took place that day.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Dempsey climbed over fellow rioters \"like human scaffolding\" and used \"his hands, feet, flag poles, crutches, pepper spray, broken pieces of furniture, and anything else he could get his hands on\" as weapons against police officers.\n\n\"Dempsey was one of the most violent rioters, during one of the most violent stretches of time, at the scene of the most violent confrontations at the Capitol on January 6, 2021,\" prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memo.\n\nThe 20-year sentence was imposed by Senior U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, a Ronald Reagan appointee who has spoken out about the \"preposterous\" rhetoric some Republicans have used as they attempt to \"rewrite history\" about the Jan. 6 attack. Lamberth has warned that \"such meritless justifications of criminal activity\" from politicians \"could presage further danger to our country.\"\n\nEchoing his language about the \"distortions and outright falsehoods\" that Republican politicians have promoted about Jan. 6, Lamberth said he was concerned that Dempsey had \"minimized\" his conduct that day and tried to come up with non-factual justifications for his behavior. Lamberth called Dempsey's behavior \"exceptionally egregious\" and said Dempsey was \"dressed for battle\" when he joined the mob trying to stop the peaceful transfer of power after President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\n\"You failed, fortunately, for our country,\" Lamberth said.\n\nHe added that Jan. 6 could have been even worse -- \"a bloodbath\" -- had rioters succeeded in their goal of getting to members of Congress who were certifying the presidential election results.\n\nWitnesses in court said that Dempsey, while being led out of court, appeared to flash an \"okay\" gesture with his fingers that has in recent years become a symbol of white supremacy and far-right causes.\n\nDempsey assaulted numerous officers on Jan. 6 but pleaded guilty specifically in connection with attacks on Washington Police Detective Phuson Nguyen, whom he hit with \"a torrent of pepper spray\" just after another rioter compromised Nguyen's mask, and Washington Police Sgt.

Jason Mastony in the head with a metal crutch, cracking the shield on his gas mask and cutting his head.\n\n\"I collapsed and caught myself against the wall as my ears rang.

The assault conviction stemmed from an October 2019, gathering near the Santa Monica Pier, where Dempsey attacked people peacefully demonstrating against then-President Donald Trump, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The peaceful protest turned violent as Dempsey took a canister of bear spray from his pants and dispersed it at close range against several protesters,\" they wrote, noting that Dempsey was sentenced to 200 days of jail time.\n\nDempsey engaged in at least three other acts of \"vicious political violence\" that didn't lead to criminal charges \"for various reasons,\" according to prosecutors. They said Dempsey struck a counter-protester over the head with a skateboard at a June 2019 rally in Los Angeles, used the same skateboard to assault someone at an August 2020 protest in Tujunga, California, and attacked a protester with pepper spray and a metal bat during a August 2020 protest in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nMore than 1,400 people have been charged with Jan. 6-related federal crimes.

The government is seeking 262 months in federal prison, which would be one of the longest sentences given to any Jan. 6 rioter.\n\n\"Dempsey was one of the most violent rioters, during one of the most violent stretches of time, at the scene of the most violent confrontations at the Capitol on January 6, 2021,\" prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memo.\n\nDempsey assaulted numerous officers but pleaded guilty specifically in connection with attacks on Washington Police Detective Phuson Nguyen, whom he hit with \"a torrent of pepper spray\" just after another rioter compromised Nguyen's mask, and Washington Police Sgt.

Hundreds of defendants have received probationary sentences, but more than 560 defendants have been sentenced to periods of incarceration ranging from a few days behind bars to 22 years in federal prison.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallows", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gallows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pepper spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Furniture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baton (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bear spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolo_contendere", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nolo contendere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Construction worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240808-David-Dempsey-vl-352p-608949.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805409", "eventUri": "eng-9805409", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 258, "textEnd": 264, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-04", "textStart": 3242, "textEnd": 3248}], "sentiment": -0.7176470588235294, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later.\n\nDavid N. Dempsey came to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol well prepared and well experienced in committing violence at political rallies. Dempsey wore a bullet-proof tactical vest, a black helmet, a gaiter to obscure most of his face, and he brought a spare gaiter and shirt that he changed into during the riot.\n\nBefore climbing up over rioters on the steps of the Capitol, he gave an interview in front of the gallows constructed nearby and rattled off the names of prominent Democrats he hated. \"They don't need a jail cell,\" Dempsey said. \"They need to hang from these.\"\n\nDempsey then repeatedly attacked police officers in the lower West Terrace tunnel for more than an hour, throwing poles and deploying bear spray at the line of officers protecting the Capitol. He then sprayed bear spray directly inside the mask of one officer, who testified that he thought he might die, and used a crutch to smash one officer's head, giving him a concussion.\n\nSenior U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth sentenced Dempsey, 37, to 20 years in prison Friday, the second-longest sentence of the approximately 950 defendants sentenced so far. Only Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys who was convicted of seditious conspiracy, received a longer sentence of 22 years.\n\n\"Your conduct on January 6 was especially egregious,\" Lamberth told Dempsey. \"You didn't make a split-second decision to use violence. You did not get carried away in the moment. You have a long and well-documented history of inflicting violence on political opponents.\"\n\nDempsey pleaded guilty in January of this year to two counts of assaulting police with dangerous or deadly weapons in the Capitol attack. His family started an online fundraiser for him, which has raised more than $20,000, saying that \"he is being politically silenced for his beliefs in the Constitution.\"\n\nThe judge also weighed Dempsey's lengthy criminal history in California for burglary, drug dealing, evading police and \"assault with a caustic chemical,\" for spraying bear spray at anti-Trump protesters in 2020, one of multiple attacks he allegedly launched at political rallies.\n\nNearly 1,500 people have been charged in the Capitol riot, and more than a third of those were charged with assaulting the police. The average sentence for assaulting police has been slightly less than four years, according to a Washington Post database.\n\nBut \"Dempsey was one of the most violent rioters, during one of the most violent stretches of time,\" prosecutors argued in their sentencing memo, \"at the scene of the most violent confrontations at the Capitol on January 6.\" That was the West Terrace tunnel, where rioters used sheer numbers to push officers from U.S. Capitol and D.C. police back toward an internal door, hurling items, spraying chemicals and cursing the officers.\n\nProsecutors said Dempsey flew from his home in Van Nuys, Calif., to Detroit on Jan. 4, then drove with friends to Washington on Jan. 5. Shortly before 4 p.m. on Jan. 6, as rioters continued to swarm the Capitol, Dempsey was captured on video climbing atop the shoulders and backs of others to reach the front line of the skirmish, where he announced his presence by throwing a short pole at an officer and cursing them.\n\nDempsey grabbed whatever was nearby and threw it at police, prosecutors said, including a riot shield and a flagpole, swung a pole into some officers, then unleashed two bursts of spray into the line of officers. Then as fellow rioter Kyle Fitzsimons of Maine yanked at the gas mask of D.C. police Sgt. Phuson Nguyen, Dempsey fired some spray into Nguyen's face before Fitzsimons snapped the mask shut, trapping the chemicals inside.\n\n\"I thought that's, you know, where I'm going to die,\" Nguyen testified in 2022 at Fitzsimons's trial. \"And in my head, I was thinking about my family at that point before anything else.\"\n\nFitzsimons then got smashed in the top of his head by another rioter swinging a crutch. It's not clear whether Dempsey was the one who inflicted that wound, but surveillance video later captured Dempsey swinging a crutch at officers at least nine times, striking D.C. police Sgt. Jason Mastony in the head and arm.\n\nProsecutors said Mastony declined to provide a victim impact statement in other cases but did so in Dempsey's case because \"Dempsey is one of the most violent rioters I encountered on Jan. 6.\" Mastony said Dempsey's crutch struck his head \"with such force that it cracked the plastic face shield of my gas mask. I collapsed and caught myself against the wall as my ears rang.\" Mastony told investigators he believed he suffered a concussion.\n\nDempsey remained in the tunnel, surveillance video showed, continuing to swing the crutch and poles at officers before retreating at about 4:42 p.m. Then, prosecutors said, he changed his gaiter and shirt, removed his helmet and put on a hat, and returned to the fray, continuing to swing and throw things at police. He was still fighting and throwing things past 5 p.m., prosecutors said.\n\nDempsey was first identified by a group of online sleuths who used open-source video and photos to supply suspect names to the FBI, as detailed in the book \"Sedition Hunters\" by NBC News reporter Ryan Reilly. The sleuths, who initially dubbed Dempsey \"FlagGaiterCopHater,\" even noticed Dempsey's change of outfits, but he continued to wear the same Converse high-top sneakers and camouflage pants throughout.\n\nDempsey appears to wear the same or similar Converse sneakers in Santa Monica, Calif., in 2019, video shows, when he was arrested after spraying anti-Donald Trump protesters with bear spray. He was convicted of that assault in 2021 and received a two-year suspended sentence. Dempsey was also photographed assaulting anti-Trump protesters with a metal bat and a skateboard, twice, at three rallies in 2019 and 2020 but wasn't charged, prosecutors said.\n\nDempsey was arrested on multiple felony counts in August 2021 and has been held in jail since. His lawyers did not file any motions seeking his release in the intervening three years, an indication that they expected him to face a lengthy prison sentence.\n\nDempsey's criminal record was so long he was classified as \"criminal history category 6\" for purposes of calculating his sentencing guidelines, the highest category. Someone with no criminal record would have qualified for a sentence of 10 to 12 years. Dempsey's guidelines called for a sentence of 17 to nearly 22 years, and prosecutors asked Lamberth to give Dempsey the high end of that range.\n\nIn front of a packed courtroom with a number of officers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6, Dempsey apologized to the police and the community. \"You were doing your duties and I responded with anger and violence,\" Dempsey said. \"To the officers and their families, I really am sorry about everything that has transpired and I hope you find it in your hearts to forgive me.\"\n\nLamberth noted that on Jan. 6, Dempsey \"spoke at length about the need to lynch various public officials.\" The judge said Dempsey \"used every instrument at your disposal...to inflict the maximum harm on the members of the 'thin blue line' protecting members of Congress and the Capitol.\" The judge declined to give the 22-year sentence sought by prosecutors, but imposed the longest sentence yet on a defendant convicted of assaulting the police at the Capitol.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_jackman@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Tom Jackman", "type": "author",

According to prosecutors, Dempsey climbed over fellow rioters \"like human scaffolding\" and used \"his hands, feet, flag poles, crutches, pepper spray, broken pieces of furniture, and anything else he could get his hands on\" as weapons against police officers.\n\n\"Dempsey was one of the most violent rioters, during one of the most violent stretches of time, at the scene of the most violent confrontations at the Capitol on January 6, 2021,\" prosecutors wrote in their sentencing memo.\n\nDempsey assaulted numerous officers but pleaded guilty specifically in connection with attacks on Washington Police Detective Phuson Nguyen, whom he hit with \"a torrent of pepper spray\" just after another rioter compromised Nguyen's mask, and Washington Police Sgt. Jason Mastony, who was hit so hard with a metal crutch that he collapsed in a daze and was left with a gash in his head, prosecutors wrote.\n\n\"Though Dempsey has pled guilty only for his assaults on Detective Nguyen and Sergeant Mastony, his violent assault on other officers defending the Capitol was relentless: swinging pole-like weapons more than 20 times, spraying chemical agents at least three times, hurling objects at officers at least ten times, stomping on the heads of police officers as he perched above them five times, attempting to steal a riot shield and baton, and incessantly hurling threats and insults at police while rallying other rioters to join his onslaught,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nBefore he assaulted officers, Dempsey stood in front of a gallows that had been set up near the Capitol, which included a sign that said, \"this is art.\" Dempsey, known to online sleuths as #FlagGaiterCopHater because of his American flag face covering and his assaults on officers, indicated he thought the gallows should be used to hang politicians he dubbed \"worthless cretins\" in video cited by prosecutors.\n\n\"String all these f---in' worthless bastards up from the top of those,\" he said in the video, pointing to the gallows, \"these treelines, the rafters, the rooftops, the statues, I don't care where they go. String 'em up and string 'em up high. And let everybody know this is what happens when you are a treasonous piece of s--- who doesn't belong in this f---in' country and has this f---in' country's worst objective at heart.\"\n\nDempsey was arrested in connection with the Capitol attack in August 2021 and had previously been charged in 2019 with dousing demonstrators in California with bear spray while he wore a \"Make America Great Again\" hat; he pleaded no contest in that case. He pleaded guilty in his Capitol attack case on Jan. 4.\n\nDempsey, who prosecutors say is a former construction worker and fast-food employee with a \"very significant history of arrests and convictions,\" was identified with the help of online sleuths who have aided the FBI in hundreds of cases against Jan. 6 rioters. Federal prosecutors say that in addition to assaulting anti-Trump protesters with bear spray in 2019, resulting in a two-year suspended sentence, he previously assaulted a counterprotester with a skateboard in a separate incident in 2019, used the same skateboard to assault another person at a political protest in 2020 and hit a person with a metal bat during another 2020 protest.\n\nMore than 1,400 people have been arrested in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, and prosecutors have secured more than 1,000 convictions. Hundreds of defendants have received probationary sentences, but more than 560 defendants have been sentenced to periods of incarceration ranging from a few days behind bars to 22 years in federal prison.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_j_reilly@aol.com", "name": "Ryan J.

Once he reached the mouth of the tunnel, Dempsey began a prolonged attack, fighting with his hands, feet, flag poles, crutches, pepper spray, broken pieces of furniture, and anything else he could get his hands on, as weapons against the police.

District Judge Royce Lamberth, marks the second longest sentence yet for a defendant convicted in connection with the Capitol assault.\n\nWith several of Dempsey's victims from the Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan Police in attendance in the courtroom during the trial, prosecutors played multiple videos showing Dempsey at one of the most violent exchanges of the riot near the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol -- repeatedly striking, kicking, and throwing object after object at the police line trying to prevent the pro-Trump mob from swarming into the building.\n\nIn one video clip, Dempsey repeatedly swung a stolen metal crutch down onto an officer's helmet, cracking the face shield.\n\nOne officer who Dempsey struck testified that he believed he was going to die and that his thoughts began drifting to his family.\n\nJudge Lamberth described Dempsey's offenses as \"exceptionally egregious\" before handing down the sentence, which he said was further warranted due to Dempsey's lengthy criminal history and past instances where he had attacked political opponents during protests in 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe judge, a Reagan appointee, said that \"fortunately\" Dempsey's efforts to break through the police line were not fruitful, as it would likely have resulted in a \"bloodbath\" for lawmakers sheltering inside the building.\n\n\"David Dempsey is political violence personified,\" a prosecutor said in making the case for Dempsey's harsh sentence.\n\nPrior to receiving his sentence, Dempsey addressed the court and spoke of his \"profound sense of regret\" for his actions, issuing a personal apology to the police gathered in the room.\n\nAfter receiving the sentence, however, Dempsey -- as he was escorted out by the bailiff -- made a hand sign in the air that is commonly associated with \"white power\" or the white supremacist Groyper movement.\n\nFederal prosecutors have charged more than 1,265 defendants and secured prison sentences for more than 460

District Judge Royce Lamberth, marks the second longest sentence yet for a defendant convicted in connection with the Capitol assault.\n\nWith several of Dempsey's victims from the Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan Police in attendance in the courtroom during the trial, prosecutors played multiple videos showing Dempsey at one of the most violent exchanges of the riot near the Lower West Terrace of the Capitol -- repeatedly striking, kicking, and throwing object after object at the police line trying to prevent the pro-Trump mob from swarming into the building.\n\nIn one video clip, Dempsey repeatedly swung a stolen metal crutch down onto an officer's helmet, cracking the face shield.\n\nOne officer who Dempsey struck testified that he believed he was going to die and that his thoughts began drifting to his family.\n\nJudge Lamberth described Dempsey's offenses as \"exceptionally egregious\" before handing down the sentence, which he said was further warranted due to Dempsey's lengthy criminal history and past instances where he had attacked political opponents during protests in 2019 and 2020.\n\nThe judge, a Reagan appointee, said that \"fortunately\" Dempsey's efforts to break through the police line were not fruitful, as it would likely have resulted in a \"bloodbath\" for lawmakers sheltering inside the building.\n\n\"David Dempsey is political violence personified,\" a prosecutor said in making the case for Dempsey's harsh sentence.\n\nPrior to receiving his sentence, Dempsey addressed the court and spoke of his \"profound sense of regret\" for his actions, issuing a personal apology to the police gathered in the room.\n\nAfter receiving the sentence, however, Dempsey -- as he was escorted out by the bailiff -- made a hand sign in the air that is commonly associated with \"white power\" or the white supremacist Groyper movement.\n\nFederal prosecutors have charged more than 1,265 defendants and secured prison sentences for more than 460 people involved in the Capitol attack, according to figures released early this year by the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news",

Kristi Noem had no problem on Sunday defending her decision to kill\u2014and then write about\u2014her 14-month-old puppy Cricket. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash raised the Politico report that named the candidates asked to submit vetting materials to Trump\u2014a list Noem wasn\u2019t on. She later cited the Cricket episode to Noem, asking if the governor had any regrets for any element of it\u2014whether including it in the book or the killing itself. \u201cThat story is a 20-year-old story of a mom who made a very difficult decision to protect her children from a vicious animal that was attacking livestock and killing livestock and attacking people,\u201d Noem told the State of the Union host. In her book, No Going Back, Noem wrote that Cricket ruined a pheasant shoot, killed a neighbor's chickens, and tried to bite Noem herself before she killed the dog she \u201chated.\u201d She also wrote about killing a goat she deemed too aggressive, dumping its body in the same gravel pit as Cricket. \u201cSo it\u2019s in the book because it was difficult for me,\u201d Noem said, \u201cand there\u2019s a lot in that book that I think people need to read.\u201d She then tried to claim the book was full of hard decisions she made, which is what influenced her to think Trump deserved to return to the White House, but Bash saw through the lines. \u201cSo what I\u2019m hearing is no regrets, not just about writing about it, but actually shooting the dog,\u201d Bash said. Noem tried to counter with a May incident of a 9-year-old boy getting killed by a dog\u2014neglecting to mention that the boy was killed by a pack of feral dogs, not a puppy owned by a family with the resources to train it\u2014before launching into a tirade about why she believed President Joe Biden was detrimental to the country. \u201cPeople are put in tough situations in life, and we learn from it,\u201d Noem said. \u201cWe learn a lot from it.\u201d", "summary": "<iframe src='https://cdn.jwplayer.com/players/6jFkgkcG-AjIcq1uW.html' width='640' height='360' frameborder='0' scrolling='auto'></iframe><figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1574,w_2795,x_32,y_47/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/Screenshot_2024-06-09_at_10.36.47_AM_pvykp9\"/><figcaption>CNN</figcaption></figure><p>Now she\u2019s reportedly no longer being considered for Donald Trump\u2019s vice-presidential slot, South Dakota Gov. <a href=\"https://thedailybeast.com/keyword/kristi-noem\">Kristi Noem</a> had no problem on Sunday defending her decision to kill\u2014and then write about\u2014her 14-month-old puppy Cricket.</p><p>CNN\u2019s Dana Bash raised the <em>Politico</em> <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/05/trump-vice-president-picks-records-00161936?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&stream=top#_ga=2.22708413.704382161.1717943227-amp-Q_Qi8fGt3ZDYydCtYPL9aA\">report</a> that named the candidates asked to submit vetting material", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/kristi-noem-still-has-no-regrets-for-killing-puppy", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1574,w_2795,x_32,y_47/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1717943821/Screenshot_2024-06-09_at_10.36.47_AM_pvykp9", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:02:43", "author": "Corbin Bolies", "authors": ["Corbin Bolies"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.53}

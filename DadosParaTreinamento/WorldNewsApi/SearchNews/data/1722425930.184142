The president was joined by New York Governor Kathy Hochul and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, both Democrats, to celebrate the opening of the monument. Legendary pop singer Elton John was also in attendance for the ceremony. \u201cThis beloved bar became the site of a call to cry for freedom, dignity, equality, and respect,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cRebellion galvanized LBGTQ community all across the nation and quite frankly around the world.\u201d The Stonewall Inn became a beacon of LGBTQ rights on June 28, 1969, when the riot took place, which is viewed as a turning point in the struggle for equality. President Obama designated the Stonewall National Monument in 2016. In addition, to Mr. Biden\u2019s visit, the Christopher Street subway station in Manhattan was renamed in honor of the Stonewall National Monument. \u201cWe\u2019re in a battle for the soul of America but I look at the pride, hope and life all of you bring and I know it\u2019s a battle we are going to know and make progress,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cLGBTQ+ people are some of the most inspiring people I know.\u201d The election-year visit by Mr. Biden is aimed at shoring up his support in the LGBTQ community during Pride Month. The Biden campaign made LGBTQ outreach a top priority this month with a presence at more than 200 Pride events and a media blitz aimed at mobilizing LGTBQ voters. LGBTQ voters are expected to overwhelmingly vote for Mr. Biden in November. GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy group estimates that Mr. Biden will receive support from roughly 68% of registered LGBTQ voters and 72% of those residing in battleground states. GLAAD also estimates that former President Donald Trump will win about 15% of the vote in both categories. However, the Human Rights Campaign \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest LGBTQ rights group \u2014 recently warned of waning support for Mr. Biden. HRC estimates that roughly one-third of the 75 million \u201cequality voters\u201d who vote based on support for LGBTQ rights may not vote for Mr. Biden. HRC officials said last month that those voters are unlikely to support Mr. Trump but could vote for an independent presidential candidate such as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. or stay home on Election Day.", "summary": "President Biden on Friday marked the 55th anniversary of the riots at the Stonewall Inn in New York, which sparked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/28/joe-biden-marks-55th-anniversary-of-stonewall-inn-/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/28/Biden_72509.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:28:24", "author": "Jeff Mordock", "authors": ["Jeff Mordock"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.154}

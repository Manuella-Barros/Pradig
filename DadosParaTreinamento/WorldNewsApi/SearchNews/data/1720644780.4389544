I would gobble up the yellow, hardback Nancy Drew books. I would read\u2014and reread\u2014them, getting lost in the antics of Nancy and her friends, Bess and George. While I was a serious reader, I wasn\u2019t a serious collector. Gary Prebula is different. He collected comic books for seven decades, a habit he blames on his mother (she bought him a Superman comic book at age three and he was hooked). In 1963, at age 12, he plopped down 12 cents to buy the first issue of The Amazing Spider-Man #1, the character\u2019s solo-debut after Stan Lee introduced the teenage superhero in the Amazing Fantasy series the year before. Marvel\u2019s The X-Men #1, another Lee creation, also cost him 12 cents that year. Prebula never sold his comic books for a profit and had even written his name in his prized Spider-Man #1. A few years ago, he decided to donate them to the University of Pennsylvania. But it turns out that donating comic books\u2014let alone 80,000 of them\u2014isn't as easy as writing a check to your favorite charity, particularly if you want to maximize your tax benefits. (\u2606) Donations to charity can be tricky. That does not mean that you can\u2019t claim a tax write-off, or even that you should not take a nice tax deduction into account when you are donating. However, the tax law is clear that you cannot write off a charitable contribution if it wasn\u2019t really a charitable contribution. You also have to be prepared to substantiate your donations\u2014something Prebula knows a little bit about. The comic book collectors and enthusiasts that I talked to made clear that comic books are less about superheroes (though, clearly, those matter\u2014we all have our favorites) and more about protecting art. At a time when comics are still a hot commodity (be sure to check out this week\u2019s trivia question), art of a different kind\u2014fine art\u2014isn\u2019t necessarily doing as well. According to a recent article, this year\u2019s New York art auctions disappointed with just $1.4 billion in spring sales\u201422% lower than 2023 and off 36% from 2022. One reason might be capital gains. Different kinds of taxes can impact different taxpayers. In a surprise reversal, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that planned congestion pricing in Manhattan\u2019s Congestion Relief Zone will be shelved indefinitely. The plan, which was set to begin on June 30, would have charged passenger vehicles up to $15 to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street and was intended to curtail vehicle traffic in and below Midtown\u2014specifically by out-of-state drivers. In the near term, it seems lawmakers are considering raising taxes on local businesses to make up the financial difference. Finally, as more graduations pile up (I\u2019m attending another one this weekend), it\u2019s encouraging to see young adults thinking seriously about education and careers\u2014and the best path forward. That\u2019s true in the tax world, too. A recent law firm merger between Kostelanetz LLP and Atlanta-based WELTY PC has also created an opportunity to strengthen its ties to Spelman College in Atlanta\u2014a historically Black college and university (HBCU) for women. I talked to two Spelman graduates about the program\u2014and their thoughts about tax law. The kids? They\u2019re alright. (\u2606) Enjoy your weekend!

Taxes From A To Z: B Is For Bonus Depreciation Bonus Depreciation Phase-out Schedule Kelly PHILLIPS ERB Businesses must generally write off the costs of assets over their \"useful life\"\u2014a number of years based on the kind of asset. Practically speaking, that means that you can't claim a tax deduction all at once for certain items and must, instead, claim the deduction in bites according to a schedule. You can depreciate most types of tangible property (except land), such as buildings, machinery, vehicles, furniture, and equipment. You can also depreciate certain intangible property, such as patents, copyrights, and computer software. For years, one of the most common forms of depreciation was called straight-line and it's calculated exactly as it sounds: an equal expense each year throughout the asset's useful life until it depreciates to zero. Bonus depreciation accelerates those deductions by allowing businesses to write off a large percentage\u2014in some cases, 100%\u2014of an eligible asset's cost in the first year. For years, the amount was limited. In 2017, tax reform changed the rules for bonus depreciation by allowing businesses to immediately write off 100% of the cost of eligible property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023. The 100% write-off of eligible property expired December 31, 2022. Unless the law changes, the bonus percentage will be reduced by 20 points each year for property placed in service after December 31, 2022, and before January 1, 2027. A bipartisan tax proposal\u2014the same one that would have expanded the child tax credit\u2014would have restored bonus depreciation for qualified property placed in service after December 31, 2022, and before January 1, 2026 (retroactive to the beginning of 2023) (\u2606). That measure passed in the House but stalled (and is likely dead) in the Senate. Filing Statistics Federal Estate Tax Returns Filed In 2021 Kelly Phillips Erb This week, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous ruling in a court case focused on a common estate plan technique for business owners involving life insurance.It is well settled that, when calculating the federal estate tax, the value of a decedent's shares in a closely held corporation must reflect the corporation's fair market value. Life insurance proceeds payable to a corporation are an asset that increases its fair market value. The question raised in Connelly v. United States was whether the company's contractual obligation to redeem a deceased taxpayer's shares at fair market value offsets the value of life insurance proceeds committed to funding that redemption. The IRS said the answer is no, and the Supreme Court agreed (\u2606). You can find more about the arguments in the case\u2014including a summary of the oral arguments here. (\u2606) By way of background, the federal estate tax is a tax on the transfer of property at death. The tax is imposed on all of the property held at death \u201cwherever situated\u201d under section 2031(a) of the tax code, and generally only applies to estates valued at more than the filing threshold for the year of the decedent's death. The threshold amount for 2024 is $13,610,000. (The table above shows returns filed in 2021, largely for deaths occurring in 2020, when the threshold amount was $11.7 million.) For those of us under the exemption amount, there may still be reasons to explore gifting assets during life rather than post-mortem. There are methods for transferring wealth to loved ones while minimizing tax liabilities through the federal annual gift tax exclusion. Understanding and leveraging this exclusion can be quite powerful for families without even needing to use up your lifetime exemption. Finally, while the ruling in Connelly is important for estate planners, it doesn't mark the end of estate planning for business owners\u2014in fact, Justice Thomas even raises an alternative in his opinion. There are a number of other techniques that are also worth taking a look at, from making annual gifts to rolling Grantor-Retained Annuity Trusts. If you\u2019re searching for the perfect tax strategy to secure your legacy but can\u2019t make a choice, perhaps consider an unconventional compass: your horoscope. (I'm not kidding\u2014check it out.) Questions Scared woman getty Extensions can be tricky. Taxpayers living and working out of the country have until June 17, 2024, to file their individual federal income tax returns\u2014no additional request for an extension required. But what happens if you can't make that date? One reader asks:I am currently living in Spain. I know I have to file my tax return by June 15. What happens if I can't file by then? Can I get another extension? If so, for how long? If you\u2019re a U.S. citizen or resident and you live outside of the U.S. or Puerto Rico, and your main place of business or post of duty is outside of the U.S. or Puerto Rico, or if you are active duty military and live outside of the U.S., you qualify for a two-month extension without having to file Form 4868. That typically moves your due date to June 15 to file and pay (June 15 is on a Saturday in 2024, so the due date is moved to June 17, 2024). However, interest is still due on any tax payment made after April 15. If you can't make that due date, you can still file for an extension (\u2606).To get more time, file Form 4868 by the due date of your return (in your case, June 17, 2024). Filing Form 4868 when you\u2019ve already been granted extra time due to special rules doesn't give you an additional six months. Your due date after filing Form 4868 is October 15, 2024 (six months from the original due date of April 15, 2024). \u2014 Do you have a tax question or matter that you think we should cover in the next newsletter?

A Deeper Dive MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA - MAY 19: Michael Saylor speaks on stage during Bitcoin Conference 2023 at Miami Beach Convention Center on May 19, 2023 in Miami Beach, Florida. (Photo by Jason Koerner/Getty Images for Bitcoin Magazine) Getty Images for Bitcoin Magazine The Tax Court continues to tackle conservation easements, and in a recent case, the IRS racked up another big win. Big Escambia Ventures LLC is the tax matters partner in 13 partnerships. The principals purchased a 4,608-acre parcel in Escambia County, Alabama, for $9.5 million in early 2014 and split it into 13 parcels (12 became the main assets of investment partnerships). Near the end of 2014, the partnerships donated easements on the properties to the National Wild Turkey Federation (and the partnerships donated the fee interests in the properties to NWTF). All in, $187,370,000 in charitable contribution deductions were allocated to investors who had contributed just over $36 million for property that had changed hands in the same year for $9.5 million in an arms-length transaction. The IRS did not approve and neither did the judge. Another high-profile court case was recently resolved\u2014outside of court. The Attorney General for the District of Columbia announced a settlement with billionaire Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy, Inc., the company he founded and ran as CEO until August 2022, when he moved into the chairman's role. As part of the settlement, Saylor and MicroStrategy will pay $40 million to resolve a lawsuit alleging that they violated the District's False Claims Act and tax laws. The Attorney General claimed that Saylor lived in the District but avoided paying more than $25 million in income taxes by pretending to be a resident of Virginia, which has a lower individual income tax rate, and Florida, which has no individual state income tax. As part of the allegations, the government claimed it had obtained records from MicroStrategy\u2014and relied on social media posts\u2014to prove the case. Saylor and MicroStrategy deny that they have violated the District's tax laws or the FCA but \"wish to avoid the time, expense, and inconvenience of any further litigation, and to resolve any and all disputes and potential legal claims\" related to the charges. The settlement has been referred to as \"the largest income tax recovery in District history.\" (\u2606) Also potentially settling in court? FTX, formerly one of the largest crypto trading exchanges in the world. A proposed settlement would whittle the company's claim made by the IRS to just $885 million. (\u2606) According to papers filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, FTX, through its lawyers, indicated that it had reached a settlement with the government related to significant tax liabilities claimed by the IRS. If the settlement is approved, FTX may have to pay just $885 million to resolve existing IRS tax claims\u2014those claims had been as high as $44 billion in earlier filings.

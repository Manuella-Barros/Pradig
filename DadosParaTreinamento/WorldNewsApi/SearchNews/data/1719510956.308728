United went into the all-Manchester as underdogs, though came away from Wembley Stadium with the trophy in their grasp. First-half goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo were enough to seal the deal as Jeremy Doku pulled only one goal back in the dying minutes. In the build-up a lot had been made of manager Ten Hag's future at the club, including rumours that he would be dismissed from his post regardless of the result. Almost 24 hours have passed since the final whistle and no such thing has happened, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe even dodging the matter entirely yesterday.

So you do understand why we do criticise sometimes. \"If you had that every single week, you would not have finished eighth. Today was unbelievable.\" United's boss acknowledged the point that had been made, before reasoning that injuries have stunted his side's progress in the league. Lineker then opened the line of questioning regarding the Dutchman's future, to which he replied: \"I don\u2019t know [if this was my last game] but the only thing I am doing is preparing my team, developing my team, progressing my players because for me this is a project. When I came in, it was a mess and we are now better but we are far not where we want to be.\" Given this was meant to be a joyous moment for Ten Hag and United, the ex-strikers were the source of discontent for some supporters that were watching the showpiece's coverage. However, Shearer evidently feels such criticism is unjust, as he doubled down on social media with an x-rated response of his own to one fan. He said: \"What part didn\u2019t you like? The part I said your team was incredible today and deserved to win or the part where I said you have been s*** for large parts of the season?\" As a player himself, Shearer played in back-to-back FA Cup finals with Newcastle United during the 1997/98 and 1998/99 seasons. He lost both - including to Man United in the latter - as part of Sir Alex Ferguson's team's treble-winning campaign.", "summary": "Alan Shearer has finally responded after the pundit was slated for the questions he posed to Erik ten Hag following Manchester United's FA Cup final success", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/alan-shearer-fires-x-rated-29242153", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29242237.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1240022479.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:00:00", "author": "James Quinlan", "authors": ["James Quinlan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.344}

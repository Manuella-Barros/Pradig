Playing with the confidence and swagger that paints an eerily similar picture to that of Michael Jordan, Edwards flashed some post-bucket moves that only fueled the comparisons even more.\n\nDuring his 27-point performance Monday night, Edwards buried a three midway through the third quarter to give the Timberwolves a 23-point lead. After the shot went down, Edwards delivered a shrug that looked plenty familiar to NBA fans who know about Jordan's iconic shrug during the 1992 NBA Finals.\n\nThere were other moments as well, like in the first half when Edwards got Nuggets guard Reggie Jackson to fall to his knees which prompted the Timberwolves star to point at Jackson. He also had several flexes after key baskets, including on an and-one shortly after his shrug-inducing three.\n\nEdwards is as flashy as it gets on the court. He said after the win that his reactions after scoring are nothing new and give him energy throughout the game.\n\n\"If I do something nice, I got to let it be known,\" Edwards said, per the NBA. \"Whether I get an and-1, I got to flex. Make somebody fall, I'm going to point at them. And it brings excitement to the game.\"\n\nAnthony Edwards, Michael Jordan similarities won't stop\n\nIt's easy to see why Anthony Edwards is not fond of being compared to one of basketball's greatest players given it's only his fourth year in the NBA. Perhaps it's absurd even to put Edwards and Jordan in the same light this early in the former's career.\n\nThat won't stop people from doing it though, and with each highlight reel play the Timberwolves guard pulls off, the more people will join in on the conversation.\n\nWatching Edwards during this Timberwolves playoff run has brought back flashes of Jordan's early career for a ton of NBA personalities. The finesse and relative ease that Edwards plays with emulates that of a young Jordan. It's hard to fathom sometimes how the 22-year-old makes things look so natural on the court.\n\nFollowing a 40-point display to clinch a series sweep over the Phoenix Suns in the first round, Edwards dropped a playoff caree-high 43 in Game 1 against the Nuggets. Through six games this postseason, he's averaging 32.3 points per game on nealry 55 percent shooting. He's also knocking down just shy of 42 percent of his 3-pointers while adding 6.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists per game.\n\nIt's not quite Jordan dropping 63 at the Boston Garden or averaging over 45 points across a five-game series, but the way Edwards is moving on the court and the energy he brings is Jordan-esque.\n\nIf we're ever truly going to compare Anthony Edwards to Michael Jordan, results have to follow for the Timberwolves. Regarding team success, Edwards and Minnesota have a chance to surpass Jordan's Chicago Bulls in the latter's fourth NBA season. Both players lost multiple first round playoff mathcups before finally breaking through with a series win in year four.\n\nThe Timberwolves still have work to do just to reach the NBA Finals.

Edwards dropped 43 points in the victory and joined Kobe Bryant as the only two players in NBA history to record back-to-back 40-point playoff games at age 22 or younger.\n\nEdwards hasn't minded the attention that has come with his stellar performances, but there is one element of which he is tired: being compared to Michael Jordan.\n\n\"I want it to stop,\" Edwards said when asked about the Jordan comparisons by Fox Sports. \"He's the greatest of all time. I can't be compared to him.\"\n\nMORE: Edwards earns Nikola Jokic's praise, Jordan comps after Timberwolves win Game 1\n\nThe comparisons between Edwards and Jordan have seemingly been endless. Former players, like Kevin Garnett and Charles Barkley, have been among those to point out the similarities between the two.\n\n\"He's like a young '84 Jordan,\" Garnett said of Edwards. \"I'm watching how he's coming through the lane ... he turn the corner, if you ain't there, he's throwing you in.\"\n\nBarkley's comparison came when addressing Edwards telling ESPN's Scott Van Pelt that he wanted to \"kill everything in front of me.\"\n\n\"It reminded me so much of Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, they would kill you to win a game,\" Barkley said. \"It's not many players in today's game -- everybody wants to be buddy-buddy.\n\n\"Anthony Edwards is [putting] everybody on notice. 'Yeah, I'm not going to wait for y'all to give me anything. I'm going to take it all.' I love it.\"\n\nWhat issue does Edwards take with the comparisons? Is he trying to avoid the weight of lofty expectations sinking him?\n\n\"No, no pressure,\" Edwards told Fox Sports. \"It's just not possible.\"\n\nEdwards has a point. After all, Jordan won six championships during his NBA career and led the league in scoring 10 times -- including a span of seven straight seasons from 1986-87 to 1992-93.\n\nAs good as Edwards has been, he's still just in his fourth season and has just one playoff series win. Thus, it's early to compare the two -- even if some undeniable similarities exist between their games.\n\nNOH: How Anthony Edwards is becoming Michael Jordan 2.0\n\nRegardless of Edwards' opinion, it appears that the 22-year-old is on a crash course toward becoming one of the faces of the league.\n\nHow exactly does he feel about that? He remains focused on one thing: winning.\n\n\"I don't really care,\" Edwards told Fox Sports. \"Whoever they make the face of the league -- they don't pick me or if they pick me -- it doesn't really bother me. I'm just trying to win with my teammates. I don't really care about being the face of the league. If my team could be the face of the league, that would be great.\"\n\nOf course, if Edwards continues to lead the Timberwolves to victory, he will move closer and closer to becoming the face of the league.\n\nHe believes that can happen as soon as this postseason.\n\n\"A healthy Timberwolves team, I see us winning the championship this year,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Van_Pelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Van Pelt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/Michael%20Jordan%20and%20Anthony%20Edwards%20050624.jpeg?itok=OMsfFrtQ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

For Minnesota Timberwolves superstar Anthony Edwards, his comparison has suddenly become none other than the one and only Michael Jordan. The similarities between Edwards' game at 22 years old and Jordan's when he was early in his career with the Chicago Bulls are eerily comparable. This is especially true given what the young All-Star has achieved at this point in the playoffs with the Timberwolves.\n\nHowever, Edwards is not painting his own narrative and is not embracing these comparisons to who many deem the greatest basketball player that has ever lived. While everyone wants to keep calling him this generation's Jordan, Edwards wants these conversations to end.\n\n\"I want it to stop,\" Edwards told Melissa Rohlin of FOX Sports. \"He's the greatest of all time. I can't be compared to him.\"\n\nWhether it is the way he glides through the air on a dunk attempt or just the energy he plays with, Edwards can't run away from looking like a mirror image of what Jordan was in the 1980s and 1990s in Chicago. Perhaps the biggest trait these two share is the need to dominate their opponents and win by any means necessary when on the court. Just the way Edwards conducts himself both on and off the court is very symbolic of who Jordan was during his playing days.\n\nThis comparison is not going anywhere anytime soon, regardless of what Edwards thinks.\n\nNBA world compares Edwards to Jordan\n\nAs much as he may not like it, Edwards can't escape all the Jordan talk. Everything about his game looks like that of the Hall of Famer's, and Edwards' peers across the NBA seem to think the same as well.\n\n\"Obviously, they have a lot of the same mannerisms,\" Timberwolves veteran guard Mike Conley told FOX Sports. \"The moves, the fadeaways, the athleticism, the poster dunks, the blocks, the defensive stuff that he does. But really, just his drive is kinda the main thing. That same kind of work ethic, that same kind of 'I don't sleep at all at night because I'm ready to play, I'm ready to hoop.'\"\n\nEven former Timberwolves great Kevin Garnett has made this comparison, stating earlier in the season that Edwards looks a lot like Jordan from 1984, when he first started out with the Bulls and won the Rookie of the Year award. That was the start of Jordan's transcendence to being the face of the NBA. Edwards responded to Garnett's take by claiming that he definitely sees the similarities regarding his game to when Jordan was first figuring things out.\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion about who the next face of the league will be after LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant retire. Nikola Jokic is not going anywhere, nor is Luka Doncic. Giannis Antetokounmpo will also remain one of those focal points, as long as he is healthy. In Edwards' case, he is so unique because he has that \"it\" factor nobody else in the league truly has. Everyone wants to win, but in addition to this desire, Edwards always has the belief that he will win.\n\nThat is what makes him different than everyone else.\n\n\"I don't really care. Whoever they make the face of the league -- they don't pick me or if they pick me -- it doesn't really bother me,\" Edwards continued. \"I'm just trying to win with my teammates. I don't really care about being the face of the league.\n\n\"If my team could be the face of the league, that would be great.\"\n\nDoesn't that just sound like something Jordan would say if he was asked this question during his playing days? Whether he likes it or not, Edwards is not going to put an end to all the talk about him being this generation's greatest player. He has been chosen for a very exclusive title that was last held by Kobe Bryant. There are no expectations higher than the ones Edwards now holds since his future is tied to Jordan's past. The only way to silence any doubters and critics is to win his first championship.\n\nFrom there, Edwards' story does not follow in Jordan's footsteps, but a new chapter in basketball lore is written.

Edwards wants it to stop.\n\nHighlights Anthony Edwards rejects MJ comparisons despite his soaring success. NBA players and fans continue to liken Edwards to Michael Jordan. Edwards must prove himself further to warrant comparisons to MJ.\n\nAnthony Edwards of the Minnesota Timberwolves is already a rising superstar and is already on pace to be the next face of the league and a perennial MVP candidate at just 22 years old.\n\nHis sudden rise in fame has drawn comparisons to Michael Jordan, who is arguably the greatest player of all time. Fans and NBA players have been taking to social media comparing the two players and even saying their playing styles are similar. Edwards nearly averaged 26 points per game, but he erupted in the playoffs, averaging 31 points in the first-round victory over the Phoenix Suns. Some have even joked that Edwards is the son of Jordan and have even tried to prove this conspiracy theory and say they look like each other.\n\nEdwards Thinks the Praise is too Lofty Six rings compared to zero is a solid starting point to dismiss the comparison\n\nEdwards recently spoke about the rumors floating around and was very respectful and modest of Jordan and wants the comparisons to stop. Edwards is only 22 years old and has zero championships compared to Jordan's six.\n\nEven though Edwards wants the comparisons to stop, it does not mean they will and the way he is playing it may even continue.\n\nEven NBA players are talking about him as well. JJ Reddick revealed Patrick Beverley had a very high opinion of him, even comparing him to Jordan.\n\nWhether or not Edwards is the son of Jordan or the next Jordan, there is no argument that he is already a superstar and is on pace for greatness. Edwards has been the best player on the Timberwolves this season, and he is the main reason the Timberwolves have had their best season since the 2003-04 season. He solidified himself as a perennial MVP candidate. Also, the Timberwolves are legit NBA Finals contenders.\n\nEdwards most definitely will have to keep up this pace and then some and continue to earn some accolades and win a few championships before the comparisons can become a serious debate one day.

Edwards' flashy style, compared to Michael Jordan, brings energy and excitement to the game. Timberwolves teammate Karl-Anthony Towns is a big fan of when Edwards is \"talking his s***.\"\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves jumped out to a 2-0 series lead over the defending champion Denver Nuggets after a dominant 106-80 win on Monday night.\n\nIt was a dominant performance by the Timberwolves, who held the Nuggets to a season-low 80 points despite missing their best defender, Rudy Gobert, due to the birth of his child.\n\nLeading the charge for Minnesota was freshly minted superstar Anthony Edwards, who scored 27 points to go along with two rebounds and seven assists, as well as several stunning plays that were immediate additions to his highlight reel.\n\nEdwards' stellar play and showmanship has earned him comparisons (that he doesn't want) to Michael Jordan. While that's certainly high praise, it's not hard to see why the similarities have been drawn between the two.\n\nEdwards can get the better of a lot of great NBA players, and when he does, he lets them know about it.\n\nAccording to Edwards, His Showmanship Is a Natural Outgrowth of His Style of Play What's he supposed to do? Not celebrate an amazing play?\n\nAfter the impressive win, Edwards was asked about his expressive outbursts. What kind of impact can that type of move have on the game as a whole?\n\nFor Edwards, it's just him being him.\n\n\"It definitely gives me energy. I feel like I've always done that, no matter which stage it's on,\" Edwards said. \"If it's in the regular season, preseason, if I do something nice, I've got to let it be known. If I get an and-1, I've gotta flex. If I make somebody fall, I'm going to point at them. It brings excitement to the game.\"\n\nTeammate Karl-Anthony Towns, was able to frame the situation a bit more succinctly.\n\n\"Let me put it like this: When Ant's out there talking his s***, I know that we're in for a good night.\"\n\nThrough two games of action, Edwards is certainly talking his s***, and it has resulted in two good nights for the Timberwolves. And with Gobert likely to return to the floor as the series returns to Minnesota, things look pretty good for the Wolves moving forward to the Western Conference finals.\n\nAs for the Nuggets, there is a lot that the defending champions need to figure out if they are going to get back into the series, and figuring out a way to stop Edwards is near the top of the list.\n\nIn Game 1, Edwards put up a playoff career-high 43 points, including 25 points in the first half when many of his teammates were struggling from the floor. It was his second straight 40-point performance, joining Kobe Bryant as the only other player 23 or younger to put up back-to-back postseason 40-burgers.\n\nThen in Game 2, Edwards led the Wolves once again, with himself and Towns matching for a game-high 27 points each as Minnesota cruised to victory.\n\nGame 3 is set to tip off at the Target Center in Minnesota on Friday night, with the Timberwolves having the chance to put themselves a win away from punching their ticket to the conference finals.\n\nRelated Anthony Edwards' Message After Game 2 Win: Nuggets 'Not the Only One Punching' Anthony Edwards is not intimidated going up against the defending champions.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/minesota-timberwolves-anthony-edwards-karl-anthony-towns.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Edwards, jogging back down the court after hitting the three, shrugged.\n\nEdwards has drawn comparisons to Jordan for his explosive athleticism, competitiveness, fadeaway jump shot, and now, for his elite-level performance in this year's NBA Playoffs. The shrug, which Jordan hit during Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals, was just the latest similarity.\n\nThe Atlanta, Ga. native, while making clear his respect for Jordan, on Monday explained to Fox Sports' Melissa Rohlin why he wants the comparisons to the six-time NBA champion to stop.\n\n\"I want it to stop,\" Edwards said. \"He's the greatest of all time.

Efficiency, scoring dominance, and leadership are the hallmarks of Edwards' impact on theTimberwolves success. Edwards heightens his game in the playoffs with versatile scoring and strong leadership.\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards has emerged as one of the current faces of the NBA.\n\nOver the first two rounds of the NBA Playoffs, Edwards has gone toe-to-toe with future hall-of-fame players and outperformed them. Routinely. The Timberwolves have yet to lose a game in these playoffs and Edwards is a big reason why, with his efficiency and killer mentality.\n\nBut as well as Edwards has played, one of the key elements of his game that few may have noticed, is his ability to lead and win over the veteran players on the roster.\n\nOld Soul in a Young Man's Body Edwards' maturity has won over the respect of some veterans\n\nVeteran Timberwolves guard Mike Conley has been impressed with Edwards's play, as the 22-year-old is averaging 32.3 points per game.\n\nEdwards has been efficient. He has been explosive. And he has been the leader the team desperately lacked since the days of Jimmy Butler.\n\nMore importantly, Edward has not backed down from any moment thus far. Mainly because he has prepared for this moment since coming into the league.\n\n\"He's a guy who has worked hard since I've known him. He's a guy who comes in early and leaves late. Really demands the most of his teammates and competes every day in practice.\"\n\nAnd just like the elite shooting guards from the past, Edwards has emerged as both the leader and franchise centerpiece.\n\nNotable Shooting Guards' Playoff Stats During Fourth Year\n\nPlayer\n\nPPG\n\nAPG\n\nRing Within the First 4 Years?\n\nMichael Jordan\n\n36.3\n\n4.7\n\nNo\n\nKobe Bryant\n\n21.1\n\n4.4\n\nYes\n\nDwyane Wade\n\n23.5\n\n6.3\n\nYes\n\nAnthony Edwards\n\n32.3\n\n5.8\n\nTBD\n\nIt started with Edwards' dominance of the Phoenix Suns in the first round. Edwards averaged 31 points per game while outscoring both Kevin Durant and Devin Booker, two of the more established scorers in the league.\n\nEdwards showcased his ability to create his own shot from mid-range by shooting 58 percent on two-point shots with only 18 percent of those shots coming from an assist.\n\nAnt Does Whatever it Takes Edwards' plan of attack is matchup-based\n\nWith 50 percent of his made field goals during the first round coming from 16 feet or greater, it is clear that Edwards is playing with confidence.\n\nWhile the post is occupied by the talented duo of Karl- Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert, Edwards can operate along the perimeter.\n\n\"I think he's taking an approach now, that it's about winning. Whatever it takes to win. Pumping up his teammates or knowing how to get guys going in different moments in games... It couldn't happen to a better guy.\" - Mike Conley\n\nAnd that willingness to do whatever is necessary has carried over into the second round. Currently, Edwards and the Timberwolves hold a 2-0 lead over the defending champions, the Denver Nuggets.\n\nAnthony Edwards' Stats By Round\n\nCategory\n\nFirst Round\n\nSecond Round\n\nPPG\n\n31.0\n\n35.0\n\n2PT Attempts Per Game\n\n12.5\n\n17.5\n\n3PT Attempts Per Game\n\n8.0\n\n2.2\n\nShots At Rim Per Game\n\n4.2\n\n9.0\n\nAs efficient as Edwards was in the first round, he has improved in the second. Instead of taking half of his shots from 16 feet and out, Edwards has chosen to take advantage of the lack of low post defense for the Nuggets and attack.\n\nThrough the first two games of the second round, Edwards has been shooting an impressive 69 percent on two-point shots. His style of play directly mimics his attitude when playing other stars. He's here. And he is ready to assume his place among the game's greats. Even if he has to take it by force.\n\n\"He's not waiting. That's what's different about him. He wants to be the best. He won't tell you, but he thinks he's the best in the world. He's very humble at the same time. He gives respect to those in front of him and the guys he looks up to.\"\n\nRelated Denver Nuggets Must Have Sense of Urgency Entering Game 3 The Nuggets face an uphill battle down 0-2 against the Timberwolves in the Western Conference Semifinals.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Butler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/edwards-mixcollage-08-may-2024-04-19-pm-8549.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The 10-foot mid-range jumper from the dotted circle in the paint for the and-1. The 15-foot turnaround jumper from the free throw line. The back-the-defender down fadeaway and the driving layup late in the fourth quarter with the game on the line.\n\nAfter four quarters of high-level playoff basketball between Minnesota and Denver, Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards produced a playoff-career high 43 points on a masterful 17-for-29 shooting performance in a 106-99 victory against the Nuggets in Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinals series.\n\nEdwards also had seven rebounds, three assists, two blocks and one steal, and whether it was a whisper in one corner or a scream from elsewhere, the Edwards' performance had people thinking.\n\nThat looked a lot like *deep breath* Michael Jordan.\n\nAnd that is a statement that generates a reaction.\n\nThose who watched and know 1980s and 1990s basketball and followed Jordan's career at the very least understand that sentiment. Edwards dominated Game 1 the way Jordan dominated a playoff game.\n\nAnd it's OK to say that. No one is saying Edwards is the next Jordan. Old heads consider that sacrilegious, and besides, no one is going to be the next Jordan or the next Magic or the next LeBron or even the next Jokic.\n\nThose players are who they are because of what they did, when they did it and how they did it - all circumstances unique to that player. Even Kobe was Jordan-esque in certain ways but ultimately he was Kobe, influencing the game and other players and creating a legacy that was distinctly his.\n\nBut there's nothing wrong with a comparison. It gives us a frame of reference. Comparisons aren't always the thief of joy. Did you watch Edwards' performance against Denver? It had elements of Jordan, and it was special.\n\nThat's not saying Edwards is one of the next greatest players ever. It's saying he has the talent and ability with that kind of potential, especially what we've seen from a player in his fourth NBA season. He is reaching levels at an age that is impressive and portends favorably.\n\nEdwards joined Kobe Bryant as the only players 22 or younger to score at least 40 points in consecutive playoff games, and Edwards became the 10th player to score 35 or more points in three consecutive road games in one postseason.\n\nDuring the regular season, he averaged 25.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and 5.1 assists and shot 46.1% from the field, 35.7% on 3s and 83.6% on free throws. He is a go-to option with a heart-stealing mindset. He made his second All-Star team and is headed for his first All-NBA selection this season.\n\nAs the NBA transitions from an era of James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, Edwards and San Antonio's Victor Wembanyama are marketable personalities. The next faces of the NBA.\n\nEdwards has work to do, and he's still early in his career. He has a long way to go before proclamations become gospel.\n\nHowever, it is possible to appreciate and recognize what Edwards is doing and consider how it resembles what other greats have done.\n\nIn the end, Anthony Edwards is the next Anthony Edwards - whatever that becomes.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Anthony Edwards-Michael Jordan comparison are OK in these

He is living up to the lofty expectations set for him with that selection, playing extraordinarily well on both sides of the court for the Timberwolves.\n\nMinnesota swept the Phoenix Suns to advance to the second round of the playoffs in the Western Conference and are now favored to beat the Nuggets as well.\n\nConsidering the way that he plays, Edwards is also receiving more and more comparisons to Michael Jordan. Even though that is increasingly fair, it also is an entirely fruitless pursuit for all involved.\n\nEdwards, however, reveled that he is not exactly a fan of the comparison:\n\n\"I want it to stop,\" the 22-year-old Edwards told FOX Sports. \"He's the greatest of all time. I can't be compared to him.\"\n\nEdwards said that it's not the pressure of the comparison that bothers him. Instead, he said, it's just simply not possible.\n\nIn fact, according to FOX Sports, the former No. 1 pick didn't even watch Jordan play when he was growing up. The similarities just happened very naturally.\n\nWhile they're both extremely competitive wings with delightful athleticism and remarkable scoring ability, perhaps it is best we just let a good thing be a good thing in the NBA.\n\nNot everything needs to come back to Jordan.

Keeping their recent playoff history in mind, we have to ask: which team is the biggest threat to the Celtics?\n\nThe 3-pointer from the wing right in a defender's face to open the game. The 10-foot mid-range jumper from the dotted circle in the paint for the and-1. The 15-foot turnaround jumper from the free throw line. The back-the-defender down fadeaway and the driving layup late in the fourth quarter with the game on the line.\n\nAfter four quarters of high-level playoff basketball between Minnesota and Denver, Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards produced a playoff-career high 43 points on a masterful 17-for-29 shooting performance in a 106-99 victory against the Nuggets in Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinals series.\n\nEdwards also had seven rebounds, three assists, two blocks and one steal, and whether it was a whisper in one corner or a scream from elsewhere, the Edwards' performance had people thinking.\n\nThat looked a lot like *deep breath* Michael Jordan.\n\nAnd that is a statement that generates a reaction.\n\nThose who watched and know 1980s and 1990s basketball and followed Jordan's career at the very least understand that sentiment. Edwards dominated Game 1 the way Jordan dominated a playoff game.\n\nAnd it's OK to say that. No one is saying Edwards is the next Jordan. Old heads consider that sacrilegious, and besides, no one is going to be the next Jordan or the next Magic or the next LeBron or even the next Jokic.\n\nThose players are who they are because of what they did, when they did it and how they did it - all circumstances unique to that player. Even Kobe was Jordan-esque in certain ways but ultimately he was Kobe, influencing the game and other players and creating a legacy that was distinctly his.\n\nBut there's nothing wrong with a comparison. It gives us a frame of reference. Comparisons aren't always the thief of joy. Did you watch Edwards' performance against Denver? It had elements of Jordan, and it was special.\n\nThat's not saying Edwards is one of the next greatest players ever. It's saying he has the talent and ability with that kind of potential, especially what we've seen from a player in his fourth NBA season. He is reaching levels at an age that is impressive and portends favorably.\n\nEdwards joined Kobe Bryant as the only players 22 or younger to score at least 40 points in consecutive playoff games, and Edwards became the 10th player to score 35 or more points in three consecutive road games in one postseason.\n\nDuring the regular season, he averaged 25.9 points, 5.4 rebounds and 5.1 assists and shot 46.1% from the field, 35.7% on 3s and 83.6% on free throws. He is a go-to option with a heart-stealing mindset. He made his second All-Star team and is headed for his first All-NBA selection this season.\n\nAs the NBA transitions from an era of James, Steph Curry and Kevin Durant, Edwards and San Antonio's Victor Wembanyama are marketable personalities. The next faces of the NBA.\n\nEdwards has work to do, and he's still early in his career. He has a long way to go before proclamations become gospel.\n\nHowever, it is possible to appreciate and recognize what Edwards is doing and consider how it resembles what other greats have done.\n\nIn the end, Anthony Edwards is the next Anthony Edwards - whatever that becomes.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/06/USAT/73585934007-usatsi-23140814.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5368,3022,x9,y276&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Smith went as far as saying that Anthony Edwards is \"the best two-way guard\" in the NBA right now...\n\nNikola Jokic and the Denver Nuggets are facing a tough task against the upstart Minnesota Timberwolves and their exciting young core led by Anthony Edwards. In Game 1, the Timberwolves took the series opener on the road, 106-99, led by Edwards' 43 points, seven rebounds and three assists.\n\nThe loss put the defending NBA champions in a tight spot as they never fell 0-1 in a series during their 2023 title run, while the Timberwolves are poised for a deep run into the playoffs for the first time since the Kevin Garnett-led squad went all the way to the Eastern Conference Finals 20 years ago.\n\n'Sensational' Anthony Edwards, Timberwolves favored by Stephen A. Smith over Nuggets\n\nThe impressive performance by Anthony Edwards led to basketball analyst Stephen A. Smith to claim that the Timberwolves are favored over the defending champions. He also said Edwards is \"the best two-way guard\" in the NBA right now, and placed the former number one overall pick in the same conversation as legends Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant.\n\n\"I got Anthony Edwards and the Minnesota Timberwolves winning this series. I've seen enough. This brother, he is so sensational it is hard to put into words,\" Smith said in the NBA Countdown program on ESPN.\n\n\"At the age of 22, we know the athleticism. But guess what we also see? We don't just see the athleticism when he drives to the basket...we see the athleticism when he blocks the shots on the defensive side of the ball.\"\n\nDuring the regular season, Edwards averaged 25.9 points on 46.1% shooting, 5.4 rebounds, 5.1 assists, and 1.3 steals in 79 games this season. But this number only increased in the playoffs so far, with per-game norms of 33.4 points on a more efficient 53.2% shooing with 7.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 1.8 steals.\n\nWhile the statement of Stephen A. Smith may sound absurd or exaggerated on the surface, seeing the tangible increases in Edwards' output from the regular season to the playoffs has nothing been short of impressive. Edwards is leading an upstart squad to the third seed entering the playoffs, and now the Timberwolves are three wins away from halting the Nuggets' run to repeat as champions.\n\nVeteran teammate compares Anthony Edwards to young Michael Jordan\n\nIt was not only Stephen A. Smith that compared Anthony Edwards to Michael Jordan, but veteran teammate Mike Conley also chimed in on the notion that \"Ant-Man\" is showing shades of a younger \"Air Jordan.\" Further, former NBA veteran JJ Redick said Edwards has the opportunity to become the next face of the league, should he continue his impressive performance in this year's playoffs.\n\nThe Timberwolves are guided by one of the league's best coaches in Chris Finch, with the team building around Edwards with the right talent fit for an up-and-coming contender.\n\nKarl Anthony-Towns, another former number one overall pick, is an inside-out threat that complements Edwards' all-around game. Jaden McDaniels and Rudy Gobert provide the defensive presence and length inside. Grizzled veteran Mike Conley provides the much-needed elder statesman presence and playmaking. Not to be overlooked are Naz Reid, Kyle Anderson, Nickeil Alexander-Walker and Monte Morris who provide the much needed spark off the bench.\n\nGame 2 of the Western Conference semifinals pairing between Minnesota and Denver will be on Monday, May 6, at 10 p.m. ET.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Edwards was rather upset at one point during the game, though, as it appeared as if someone on the Timberwolves' bench farted and he wanted to know who did it.\n\nI think Edwards was also defending himself at the end there, by hilariously making it clear he wasn't the one who farted. I wonder if the culprit was eventually caught.\n\nRegardless, Edwards was all smiles at the end as they won with ease, and that's what matters. The Timberwolves were the underdogs coming into this series and they have now won both games in Denver to take a commanding 2-0 lead.\n\nEdwards dominated in that first game with 43 points and while he wasn't quite as good in this one, the 22-year-old still finished with 27 points, 2 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2 steals. With Edwards leading the way, the Timberwolves are now just two wins away from their second-ever appearance in the Western Conference Finals. He truly has changed the fortunes of a franchise that was mired in mediocrity for over a decade.\n\nAnthony Edwards Has Been Unstoppable In These Playoffs\n\nThe Timberwolves took some major strides this season and finished with a 56-26 record to be the third seed in the Western Conference. There were still some doubts about whether they'd make a deep run, especially as they were matched up with the Phoenix Suns in the first round.\n\nPhoenix had won all three regular-season meetings between the teams by double digits, but Edwards ensured the script would be flipped in the playoffs. The Timberwolves completely outplayed the Suns and ended up sweeping them, with Edwards being the best player on the court.\n\nWhile that was ever so impressive, I thought the Conference Semifinals was as far as Edwards would be able to take this team. I didn't see the Timberwolves knocking out the Nuggets, but now, it is hard to see how they won't knock them out.\n\nIf and when that happens, conversations will start on whether Edwards has a case to be regarded as the best player in the NBA. The two-time All-Star is averaging 32.3 points, 6.8 rebounds, 5.8 assists, 1.8 steals, and 0.8 blocks per game in these playoffs while shooting 54.7% from the field and 41.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nThose are some ridiculous numbers, especially for someone who is still so young. With how well Edwards and the team as a whole have played thus far, I think you have to make the Timberwolves the favorites now to get to the NBA Finals from the West.\n\nWhile Edwards has been this offensive force that teams just have had no answer for in these playoffs, the Timberwolves defense has perhaps been just as impressive. They shut down the Suns' offense and have now held the Nuggets to under 100 points in each of the first two games of this series. If they keep playing this well, I don't see the Oklahoma City Thunder or the Dallas Mavericks beating them over seven games.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gautam_varier@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Gautam Varier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Gaming", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Gaming", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjYzNzE5OTg5MDkzNTUy/usatsi_23191784.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Redick, \"I told him, 'Man, you've got a chance, brother, to be Michael Jordan.\"\n\nESPN's Kendrick Perkins and Stephen A.

At one point, Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards backed Kentavious Caldwell-Pope down, then busted out a spin move and a fadeaway jumper from midrange. It was only one of the buckets Edwards got in his 43-point outing that powered Minnesota to a surprising Game 1 win, but it stuck out because of an observation Jamal Crawford made where he came really close to comparing Edwards to a player he refused to name.\n\nIt was a fun moment (particularly because of Reggie Miller's prodding), but it also was the latest example of what has become an increasingly common thing: Edwards getting comparisons to Michael Jordan. They pop up for a few different reasons -- Edwards' game, how magnetic of a personality he is, his unwavering sense of confidence in himself -- but in a new piece by Melissa Rohlin of Fox Sports, we learned that Edwards would prefer these comparisons never happen.\n\n\"I want it to stop,\" Edwards said. \"He's the greatest of all time.

In a May 6 story with FOX Sports' Melissa Rohlin, Edwards gave his honest thoughts on being compared to Jordan.\n\n\"I want it to stop,\" he told Rohlin. \"He's the greatest of all time. I can't be compared to him.\"\n\nDespite the talent, the comparison is premature since Edwards has not sniffed the same success Jordan did during his heyday. Jordan won five Most Valuable Player awards and six NBA titles. At the same time, he did not win a championship until he was 28. Edwards is 22 years old and just came off his first playoff series win. He has plenty of time, though.\n\nHowever, the comparison proves how exciting Edwards is as a player. Edwards just led the Timberwolves to their first playoff series win since 2004 -- their first playoff victory since they had Kevin Garnett in his prime. Now, they had a very impressive playoff victory over the reigning NBA Champion, the Denver Nuggets, on their home floor.\n\nIf Edwards guides the Timberwolves to multiple titles, then the comparison will likely gain more steam.\n\nFor his performance against the Phoenix Suns, NBA.com's Michael C. Wright named Edwards as the Most Valuable Player of the Timberwolves first-round series.\n\nWright explained why he picked Edwards in a May 6 story.\n\n\"Edwards averaged a career-high 25.9 points in the regular season with 5.1 assists and 5.4 rebounds. The 22-year-old then cranked up his production in the first round. Against the Suns, Edwards averaged 31 points, 8 rebounds, 6.3 assists and 2 steals in leading Minnesota's sweep of veteran-laden Phoenix. Along the way, we saw some viral moments from a player TNT's Charles Barkley called \"a dog\" (in a good way).\"\n\nWright also explained why he had Karl-Anthony Towns as the runner-up.\n\n\"Towns had nothing but praise for his superstar teammate. Still, he deserves a shoutout, too, for his 19.3 ppg effort in the series shortly after returning from a one-month hiatus (knee).\"\n\nEdwards lived up to his billing in Game 1 against the Nuggets. In their win, Edwards put up 43 points on 17-for-29 shooting. A playoff career-high for him.\n\nThough Edwards frowns upon the comparison, Mike Conley entertained why he's being compared to the basketball icon.\n\n\"Obviously, they have a lot of the same mannerisms,\" Conley told Rohlin. \"The moves, the fadeaways, the athleticism, the poster dunks, the blocks, the defensive stuff that he does. But really, just his drive is kinda the main thing. That same kind of work ethic, that same kind of 'I don't sleep at all at night because I'm ready to play, I'm ready to hoop.'\"\n\nConley has played with some great talent over the years. Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol, Zach Randolph, Donovan Mitchell, and Rudy Gobert, to name a few outside of the Timberwolves. As one of the oldest players in the NBA, Conley hadn't played with a player like Edwards before Minnesota acquired him in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_john@heavy.com", "name": "Matt John", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Randolph", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Randolph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pau_Gasol", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pau Gasol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gasol", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gasol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151520422-e1715021163948.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 50, "textEnd": 55, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

He oozes swagger. He's regularly being compared to a young Michael Jordan, with side-by-side videos flooding the internet of their seemingly mirror images elevating over hapless defenders, making them look like synchronized swimmers gliding through the air.\n\nTheir similarities are obvious to everyone, with one notable exception.\n\n\"I want it to stop,\" the 22-year-old Edwards told FOX Sports. \"He's the greatest of all time. I can't be compared to him.\"\n\nBut even he can't kink the firehose.\n\nSaid Kevin Garnett: \"He's like a young '84 Jordan.\" Added Patrick Beverley: \"I told him, 'Man, you've got a chance, brother, to be Michael Jordan.\" Posted Kendrick Perkins on X: \"We are watching the Future Face of the NBA.\" Chimed in Draymond Green on his podcast: \"I think Anthony Edwards is poised to be that next guy.\"\n\nHis play this postseason has only reinforced those claims.\n\nHe averaged 31 points, including career-highs in field goal percentage (51.2%), rebounds (8) and assists (6.3) in the Timberwolves' first-round sweep over Kevin Durant's Phoenix Suns, the franchise's first series win in 20 years and its only perfect one in its 34-year history.\n\nEdwards has undeniably transformed from a two-time All-Star into a full-blown superstar, punctuated by consecutive 40-point performances over his last two games, including a postseason career-high 43 points against the Denver Nuggets in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals on Saturday.\n\nThat's not hyperbole.\n\nSince the start of the playoffs, Edwards has generated the second-most video views across NBA social and digital platforms (100 million), trailing only LeBron James, who has long been the face of the league. He has also gained the most Instagram followers of any player since the start of the postseason, skyrocketing from 2.1 million to 2.35 million, three times more than anyone else.\n\nThe way he flies. The way he controls his body in the paint. The way he accelerates. There's just something undeniably Jordan-esque about it.\n\n\"Obviously, they have a lot of the same mannerisms,\" Timberwolves guard Mike Conley told FOX Sports. \"The moves, the fadeaways, the athleticism, the poster dunks, the blocks, the defensive stuff that he does. But really, just his drive is kinda the main thing. That same kind of work ethic, that same kind of 'I don't sleep at all at night because I'm ready to play, I'm ready to hoop.'\"\n\nThe fascinating thing about the Jordan comparisons is that they may be coincidental. Unlike Kobe Bryant, who made an art of copying Jordan's moves and intensity, Edwards never studied him.\n\n\"He didn't watch Jordan play,\" said Justin Holland, who trained Edwards since he was 14 and is now his business partner. \"It's natural.\"\n\nThose closest to Edwards say he reminded them of Jordan long before that became part of the national narrative. To them, it's his competitiveness that stands out most.\n\nIt's well documented that Jordan was ruthless when it came to any competition, ranging from basketball, to cards, to golf, to even water-drinking contests. Edwards shares that same quality.\n\nHis uncle, Chris Edwards, has learned to never challenge him to anything. His brothers watched him start fights when he'd lose one-on-one competitions in their grandmother's backyard.\n\nOne time, after losing a ping-pong game, Edwards disappeared for a few days, doing nothing but watching YouTube videos of professional ping-pong highlights and practicing.\n\n\"In about two weeks,\" Holland said, \"Nobody could beat him.\"\n\nSo, considering the Jordan comparisons are coming from everywhere, including basketball experts and his inner circle, why does he reject them?\n\nIs the pressure too much?\n\n\"No, no pressure,\" Edwards told FOX Sports. \"It's just not possible.\"\n\nIt was a pre-draft workout back in 2020, and the ultra-competitive Edwards was hitting new heights during a series of one-on-one games with a couple of pro players.\n\n\"Ant is going so hard,\" Holland said. \"I mean, as if it were an overtime game on the line.\"\n\nThe scene was inspired by something that happened moments earlier. Edwards heard someone trash-talk him. He stopped his individual workout. He walked downcourt. And he started playing as though it were Game 7 of the Finals.\n\n\"The other guys are playing one-on-one, but, I mean, he's scoring back-to-back-to-back,\" Holland said. \"The other guy doesn't even get a chance to get the ball.\"\n\nAfterward, Holland found out who was the instigator.\n\n\"I'm honestly thinking it's a teenager,\" Holland said. \"The kid is 6 years old.\"\n\nApparently, that kindergartner had told Edwards he couldn't beat his daddy, something the future No. 1 draft pick took personally.\n\n\"He's like, 'I had to let him know,'\" Holland recalled.\n\nFor Edwards, it doesn't matter who is calling him out. If someone doubts him, he has a deep-seated need to make them choke on their words.\n\nReally, that's why he turned to basketball in the first place.\n\nEdwards was a football star growing up, considered one of the top Pop Warner running backs in the country by age 10.\n\nBut Edwards' older brother, Antony (known as Bubba), helped swivel his focus to basketball because of their ultra-competitive one-on-one games. When Anthony would lose, he'd lose it.\n\n\"He'd want to start fighting,\" Bubba said. \"Blows were thrown.\"\n\nAnthony decided to focus on basketball, mostly so he could beat his brother.\n\n\"I was like, forget football,\" Edwards told FOX Sports. \"I want to be like, Bub.\"\n\nEdwards, who is the youngest of four siblings, attributes his battles against them to also inspiring another one of his skills: trash talk.\n\nHe needed every advantage he could get. He was willing to do anything for an edge, including using his mouth to compensate for whatever skills he may have lacked at the time.\n\n\"I would say growing up in the backyard, playing 21 with my brothers, I never could win,\" Edwards told FOX Sports. \"So I would try to talk them out of winning. I would find a way to cheat the game. 'Hey, let me get a free two-points right here.' But they would never do it. So I would try to trash-talk them out of the game. It wouldn't work. But as I got older, the better I got at trash-talking.\"\n\nEdwards is now so well-known for his verbal manipulation skills that he recently played a trash-talking foil in the movie \"Hustle\" alongside Adam Sandler.\n\nIf you ask Kevin Durant, he'd likely say Edwards wasn't doing much acting.\n\nEven though Edwards grew up idolizing the two-time NBA champion, he didn't hesitate to try to get under his skin during their first-round playoff series. In Game 3, en route to Edwards' 36-point, nine-rebound and five-assist performance, he talked smack to Durant following making several 3s, including one over Durant's outstretched arms.\n\nDurant smiled and shook his head.\n\nAnd after Edwards helped eliminate the Suns last Sunday, he further twisted the knife into Durant, who will be his teammate on the U.S. Men's Basketball Team at the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nEdwards emphasized that he can't wait to play alongside his childhood hero soon. But not for the reasons you may think.\n\n\"Talk a little trash,\" Edwards said. \"And let him know I sent him home.\"\n\n***\n\nEdwards' intensity undoubtedly conjures images of Jordan's fire. But they also have a lot of differences.\n\nEdwards' family describes him as soft and sensitive.\n\n\"He wears his heart on his sleeve,\" Uncle Chris said. \"That's why he don't read [social media] comments a lot. People can be so hard on him. It gets to him more than it may show.\"\n\nYou may not know that Edwards won his fifth-grade spelling bee (the winning word? Hamburger). Or that his favorite thing to do is prank people by dumping water on them and throwing snowballs in their faces. Or that he prefers to spend his evenings playing video games and eating chicken fingers rather than partying.\n\nWithin the Timberwolves organization, he's considered coachable and a good teammate.\n\nAnd while the explosion of Jordan's skills may have been inspired by him failing to make his high school varsity basketball team, Edwards' ascent was inspired by grief.\n\nIn 2015, when Edwards was 14 years old, his mother, Yvette, and grandmother, Shirley, both died from cancer within eight months of one another.\n\nEdwards channeled all his emotions into the sport, using it as an anesthetic for his pain. In fact, the night his mother died, Anthony and Bubba threw themselves into the one thing that could distract them from their paralyzing grief.\n\n\"They went to the gym for eight hours,\" Uncle Chris said. \"I was sitting there in the parking lot. I left, came back. Left, came back. I came into the gym, I was like, 'What time do y'all close?' [The janitor] was like, 'We close at 6, I heard what happened, and I just let them shoot.' It was 10 p.m.\"\n\nAbout six months later, Edwards linked up with Holland, who was well-known in the Atlanta area for training top college prospects. As the story goes, Edwards impressed him with his positive attitude despite the cards he was dealt, not his basketball skills.\n\nEdwards initially balked at the intensity of Holland's workouts, but, after a little encouragement from his uncle, he began craving them, showing up seven days a week and obsessing over every detail of his game.\n\nEdwards' game skyrocketed.\n\nHe grew from being a scrappy player who could get five steals a game when he'd press as an elementary schooler, into a seventh grader who could dunk, into a 10th grader who starred on the Under Armour Circuit.\n\nBubba still remembers being wowed at that event when he took one step, faked the other way, elevated off his left leg and then made a right-handed jam over a large center.\n\n\"It was coming together,\" Bubba said. \"Like, OK, he's going to be a problem.\"\n\nEdwards said basketball saved him from himself.\n\n\"Sports in general helped me stay out of a lot of trouble as a kid,\" Edwards told FOX Sports. \"Helped me stay out of a lot of trouble now. It's a shoulder to cry on.\"\n\nHe wants to be the best version of himself, whatever that might mean.\n\nHe hasn't reached out to Jordan for advice. Or LeBron James, even though he's being pegged as the next face of the league.\n\n\"I don't talk to anyone,\" Edwards told FOX Sports. \"None. But I would say, the people around me, they keep me level-headed, like Justin [Holland], my brother [Bubba], my uncle Drew, my uncle Chris. They keep me level-headed, man. They talk s--- to me all the time, tell me stuff that I need to be doing that I'm not doing right. So I think that's pretty much all the advice I need is from the people I love.\"\n\nEdwards is currently being flanked by cameras for a Netflix documentary he's starring in alongside a few other superstars, including James, and that's being produced, in part, by James' SpringHill production company.\n\nBut it hasn't gone to his head.\n\nNext Michael Jordan? Next face of the league? Not his focus.\n\n\"I don't really care,\" Edwards told FOX Sports. \"Whoever they make the face of the league -- they don't pick me or if they pick me -- it doesn't really bother me. I'm just trying to win with my teammates. I don't really care about being the face of the league. If my team could be the face of the league, that would be great.\"\n\nRight now, he's obsessing over something else: Trying to get past the defending champion Nuggets.\n\nNow that, he'll gladly run his mouth about.\n\n\"A healthy Timberwolves team, I see us winning the championship this year,\" Edwards told FOX Sports.\n\nAs for the Jordan comparisons, if anything, his inner circle believes they may be underselling Edwards' potential.\n\nBubba likened Edwards to a \"Create A Player\" in the video game NBA2K whose skills are customized: \"All his game sliders are turned up to 100.\"\n\nAdded Holland: \"He has an opportunity, if he can lock in and take advantage of what he's doing, he has a chance to not only be the face of the league, but the best person to ever touch a basketball.\"\n\nAs for Edwards, he's just keeping his head down and working hard. He's not overly concerned about his future.\n\nSo far, it has worked well for the young star.\n\nEdwards' family believes he doesn't need Jordan as inspiration because his motivation comes from elsewhere.\n\n\"I feel like he's playing so hard because he knows he's got two of his queens watching him,\" Bubba said of their mother and grandmother. \"His every move, he's trying to impress them and keep them smiling and keep them proud.\"\n\nFor the last three years, Uncle Chris would cry whenever he attended his nephew's NBA games because he was so heartbroken that Edwards' mother wasn't there to witness them. He recently stopped after hearing how the superstar views things.\n\nEdwards believes his mother and grandmother never really left him. They're just viewing him from a different vantage point.\n\nSo, whether Edwards becomes the next Jordan is irrelevant. He has more important people to impress.\n\n\"It's a crazy feeling,\" he said, \"knowing that they watching from up top.\"\n\nMelissa Rohlin is an NBA writer for FOX Sports.

But they didn't need Gobert's defensive prowess in order to suffocate the Nuggets' offense to the tune of 80 points.\n\nTrailing 61-35 at the break, the Nuggets' 26-point halftime deficit was Denver's largest in a home playoff game in franchise history.\n\nThe Timberwolves led 82-60 after three quarters and cruised the rest of the way.\n\nEdwards continues his ascent as one of the brightest young stars in the NBA. While all NBA players are compared to those that came before them, Edwards' comparison has suddenly become none other than the one and only Michael Jordan.

This is especially true given what the young All-Star has achieved at this point in the playoffs with the Timberwolves.\n\nHowever, Edwards is not painting his own narrative and is not embracing these comparisons to who many deem the greatest basketball player that has ever lived.

He's the greatest of all time.

I don't really care about being the face of the league. If my team could be the face of the league, that would be great.\"\n\nEdwards had dismissed the Jordan comparisons in December 2023 as well, but his continued improvement since has put an even larger spotlight on his similarities with Jordan.\n\n\"I just want them to stop. He's the greatest to ever play basketball. And I'm so far from it.\"\n\nEdwards is averaging 33.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 5.6 assists through the 2024 NBA Playoffs, dominating opponents on both sides of the ball. He is not Jordan or the second-coming of Jordan but he seems to have all the athletic and defensive tools to be an all-time shooting guard, along with the shooting touch of modern players.\n\nThe Michael Jordan Comparisons Won't Stop\n\nEven if Edwards wants these talks to stop, the nature of basketball discourse means it'll be brought up consistently for the rest of his career. He can't escape it, especially with how similar his on-court style is to Jordan's. Even the GOAT has sent commendations Edwards' way through Stephen A. Smith.\n\n\"I called the GOAT. Me and Wilbon called him, the GOAT, Michael Jordan. We're like, 'Yo, you seeing this?' Michael Jordan was like, 'That brother is special, no question about it.'\"\n\nThe comparisons have been floating around the league since Edwards was drafted in 2020, but Kevin Garnett comparing Edwards to the '80s version of Jordan is what got the conversation moving. Since then, we've seen more and more people make this comparison.\n\nEven Edwards' teammate Mike Conley sees the similarities.\n\n\"Obviously, they have a lot of the same mannerisms. The moves, the fadeaways, the athleticism, the poster dunks, the blocks, the defensive stuff that he does. But really, just his drive is kinda the main thing. That same kind of work ethic, that same kind of 'I don't sleep at all at night because I'm ready to play, I'm ready to hoop.'\"\n\nThe pressure of living up to Jordan can be too much to deal with, so Edwards is doing the smart thing by underplaying expectations.

As the Timberwolves soared to a commanding 2-0 lead in their second-round playoff series, Edwards' emphatic words resonated with the confidence and swagger that have defined his burgeoning career.\n\nDuring a recent media appearance, Edwards was confronted with the prospect of facing off against established stars like Murray. A reporter inquired about the experience of competing against \"OGs\" in Denver, specifically referencing Murray. Edwards' response was unapologetically candid, reflecting both his youthful exuberance and unwavering self-belief.\n\n\"Hell naw. What is he 27? I'm finna turn 23, dog. [Kevin Durant] is 36 or 35,\" Edwards retorted, dismissing any notion of intimidation or reverence for his more experienced counterparts. With a single sentence, Edwards signaled his readiness to take on the mantle of leadership and lead the Timberwolves to playoff glory.\n\nThe significance of Edwards' statement extends beyond mere bravado; it encapsulates the fearless mentality that has propelled him to the forefront of the league's rising stars. As the Timberwolves continue their quest for postseason success, Edwards has emerged as a beacon of hope and inspiration for the franchise and its devoted fanbase.\n\nOn the court, Edwards has backed up his words with a stellar performance, outshining Murray and leaving an indelible mark on the series. Averaging an astonishing 35.0 points per game, Edwards has showcased his scoring prowess and ability to thrive under pressure. With each electrifying play and clutch basket, he has solidified his status as a transformative figure for the Timberwolves.\n\nEdwards has dominated Murray in this series\n\nIn contrast, Murray, a seasoned veteran with a championship pedigree, has faltered in the face of Edwards' relentless onslaught. Despite his pedigree and past accomplishments, Murray has been unable to match Edwards' intensity and impact on the court, averaging just 12.5 points per game in the series.\n\nAs the Timberwolves prepare to return home for Game 3, Edwards' words linger in the air, serving as a rallying cry for his teammates and a challenge to his adversaries. With the spotlight firmly fixed on him, Edwards has the opportunity to further cement his legacy and lead the Timberwolves one step closer to playoff glory.\n\nIn a league defined by its stars and narratives, Anthony Edwards' bold declaration stands as a testament to his unyielding confidence and unwavering determination.

He's not trying to get a leg (or a foot) up on trying to get the rebound in case of a miss. He also isn't off balance. This step is by design, something he and his longtime skills trainer and coach Kierre Jordan have put in Edwards' routine.\n\nThe step is because the Timberwolves' All-Star guard begins the shot in his toes to generate power, along with raising his calves.\n\n\"A lot of times he would stay on the line and take his shoulders back instead of making sure his momentum was going forward,\" Jordan said. \"So now to make sure we have your momentum going forward, let's add that step after you shoot.\"\n\nThe step has worked. Edwards' free-throw percentage rose to 83.6% from 75.6% a season ago even as his attempts went up from 5.3 to 6.4 per game. He was also on pace to up his three-point percentage numbers this season before a late-season slump took it from 37.3% to 35.7% in the past 10 games. He has made up for that in the playoffs by shooting 41.9%.\n\nAnd Edwards' all-around scoring ability has been the talk of the league as the Timberwolves swept their first six playoff games heading into Friday's Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals against Denver at Target Center.\n\nBefore Edwards came into the league, one of the knocks on his NBA future was that he would never develop into an efficient shooter, and if there was any criticism Edwards took to heart in his four-year NBA career, it was that one.\n\nShortly after last season's first-round exit to Denver, Edwards said this in an interview with the Star Tribune: \"I'm a scorer. I don't pride my game on just getting to the rim. I hate when people say that. I work too hard to be somebody who finishes at the rim. I can score the ball with the best of them.\"\n\nAbout a year after he said that, Edwards is showing the NBA world just how good a scorer he can be -- and how good of a shooter he can be. He's averaging 32.3 points per game in the postseason and had three consecutive 35-plus point games, something only replicated at 22 years old or younger by Lew Alcindor (now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.\n\n\"A lot of work, man. It's a lot of work,\" Edwards said after a 43-point performance in Game 1. \"Super tiring. But it's all worth it when it shows on nights like [Game 1].\"\n\nWhen Jordan, who has worked with Edwards since he was about 15, was asked how often Edwards was working on his mid-range shot this summer, he let out a high-pitched \"Oooh.\" Edwards had four workouts a day over the summer (not all focused on shooting) but he would still put up hundreds of shots per day, to the point he was shooting 2,000 shots per week.\n\nHis shot has changed from the time he came into the league. Jordan and Chris Hines, Edwards' player development coach on the Wolves, constantly work with Edwards to make sure his shooting \"pocket\" is in line -- that the process of Edwards bringing the ball up from near his waist to the follow through is clean. That includes having his elbow at the correct 90 degree angle when he brings the ball up and finishing his shot by extending his follow through to the point where his elbow above his eye, instead of finishing in a downward motion.\n\n\"From his pocket to his form, it has to stay the same,\" Hines said.\n\nThe challenge is to make that consistent, even when Edwards is doing something besides an open catch-and-shoot three, like shooting a contested midrange jumper. Jordan said the dribble before he shoots is crucial, that the dribble must end up in Edwards' shot pocket so he can get into the normal mechanics of his shot.\n\n\"You don't want there to be any type of in-between space where the defender can reach in there and steal the ball, or they can affect your pickup,\" Jordan said. \"So a lot of times we'd make sure it's a lot of hard pound, low to the ground, one dribble pull up.\"\n\nNot only did Edwards want to work on his midrange game last offseason he also wanted to work on his post-up game. For that, Jordan applied some of the lessons he had from another client of his, New Orleans forward Brandon Ingram.\n\n\"That was his favorite thing,\" Jordan said. \"The post up stuff, I was able to transition the work I use with him and apply it with Ant. Ant, with him being a physical specimen, this is perfect.\"\n\nIn particular, Jordan told Edwards he had to give his defender a \"bump\" to create separation with his arm or shoulder. Not a bump \"chicken wing\" style, Jordan said, where Edwards might commit an offensive foul, but more subtle. All that work paid off in a key moment in Game 1, when Edwards had backed down Denver guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. There was the bump, and Edwards then whirled around to his right and drained a jumper to put the Wolves up 102-91 with 1 minute, 36 seconds left.\n\n\"He would just say, 'I can be the best guard in the league,' \" Jordan said. \"He was saying that two summers ago. So to be manifesting right now -- he had a plan, he had a goal.\"\n\nWhile Edwards works with Jordan a lot in the offseason, he is working with Hines during the season. Hines, who sits just behind the bench, helps Edwards break down film and is a constant reminder in his ear about his shot mechanics.\n\n\"We have all these techniques or sayings that he knows, 'OK, why am I missing that shot?'\" Hines said.\n\nHe and Edwards have quick ways to communicate that in game. For instance, Edwards knows exactly what Hines means when he says \"box\" or \"you're not in your box.\"\n\n\"That means he's going left or right on his landing,\" Hines said. \"He's not going straight up and down and now he's off-balance in his shot.\n\nA quick \"pocket\" from Hines to Edwards lets Edwards know he has to fix that process of getting the ball up and released in a straight up-and-down motion with no vacillation.\n\n\"Base\" means Hines doesn't see Edwards generating power from his legs enough. \"Elbow over eyebrow\" means Edwards isn't following through properly.\n\n\"Now he knows how to change it or fix it in the game,\" Hines said.\n\nThere are times during the long slog of the season that Hines said Edwards could get bored with the repetition, and Edwards would try some different things with his shot, much to Hines' chagrin.\n\n\"He can be an elite shooter,\" Hines said. \"He likes playing with it a little bit. It's funny because I'm like 'Dude, just say solid all the time.' He'll say 'I thought it was gonna go in.' You gotta stop thinking it's going to go in. Make it go in.\"\n\nBut one area where Edwards hasn't gotten bored is in trying to figure out how teams are guarding him. That's perhaps Edwards' biggest area of growth the second half of the season. When Karl-Anthony Towns went out and teams became even more focused on Edwards, he had to make the right reads and decisions to move off the ball. The lessons he learned then are paying dividends with Towns back in the playoffs.\n\n\"It's crazy. It's like a supercomputer,\" Hines said. \"... He's starting to see it at a faster rate. It's going to get to the point where we won't even have to talk about it, it'll just be a read.\"\n\nEdwards is also trusting that he can get the ball back should he give it up in those situations, and when he does, he's never been more shot ready than he is now, whether from deep, midrange or the free-throw line.\n\n\"When I came into the league, the thing was that I couldn't shoot,\" Edwards said. \"So those summers that I had leading up to now, me, C. Hines and Key, it was a lot of work. Just shooting. Just shooting.\"", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_hine@startribune.com", "name": "Chris Hine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_throw", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free throw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Abdul-Jabbar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Abdul-Jabbar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Star Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Ingram", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Ingram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentavious_Caldwell-Pope", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentavious Caldwell-Pope"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/EUCSFDU27RDMRKCX5TUAAZBR24.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

I Can't Be Compared To Him\"", "body": "The comparisons between Anthony Edwards and Michael Jordan are increasing as Edwards keeps ascending through the 2024 NBA Playoffs. But it seems Edwards is sick of hearing his name next to the NBA's greatest player, openly telling FOX Sports that he wants the Jordan comparisons to stop.\n\n\"I want it to stop. He's the greatest of all time. I can't be compared to him.\"\n\nEdwards' respect for Jordan is clear, but it seems he's more focused on being the best he can be rather than hold himself to becoming the next Jordan. He doesn't even care to be the face of the league unless it means the Timberwolves as a whole would be the faces of the NBA.\n\n\"I don't really care. Whoever they make the face of the league -- they don't pick me or if they pick me -- it doesn't really bother me. I'm just trying to win with my teammates. I don't really care about being the face of the league. If my team could be the face of the league, that would be great.\"\n\nEdwards had dismissed the Jordan comparisons in December 2023 as well, but his continued improvement since has put an even larger spotlight on his similarities with Jordan.\n\n\"I just want them to stop. He's the greatest to ever play basketball. And I'm so far from it.\"\n\nEdwards is averaging 33.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 5.6 assists through the 2024 NBA Playoffs, dominating opponents on both sides of the ball. He is not Jordan or the second-coming of Jordan but he seems to have all the athletic and defensive tools to be an all-time shooting guard, along with the shooting touch of modern players.\n\nThe Michael Jordan Comparisons Won't Stop\n\nEven if Edwards wants these talks to stop, the nature of basketball discourse means it'll be brought up consistently for the rest of his career. He can't escape it, especially with how similar his on-court style is to Jordan's. Even the GOAT has sent commendations Edwards' way through Stephen A. Smith.\n\n\"I called the GOAT. Me and Wilbon called him, the GOAT, Michael Jordan. We're like, 'Yo, you seeing this?' Michael Jordan was like, 'That brother is special, no question about it.'\"\n\nThe comparisons have been floating around the league since Edwards was drafted in 2020, but Kevin Garnett comparing Edwards to the '80s version of Jordan is what got the conversation moving. Since then, we've seen more and more people make this comparison.\n\nEven Edwards' teammate Mike Conley sees the similarities.\n\n\"Obviously, they have a lot of the same mannerisms. The moves, the fadeaways, the athleticism, the poster dunks, the blocks, the defensive stuff that he does. But really, just his drive is kinda the main thing. That same kind of work ethic, that same kind of 'I don't sleep at all at night because I'm ready to play, I'm ready to hoop.'\"\n\nThe pressure of living up to Jordan can be too much to deal with, so Edwards is doing the smart thing by underplaying expectations. But if he continues on the trajectory he's on, these comparisons will become commonplace.\n\nRelated: Comparing Anthony Edwards, Michael Jordan, And Dwyane Wade After They Won Their First Playoff Series\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

In addition, analysts and peers alike have increasingly made comparisons between Edwards and Michael Jordan.\n\nDuring this year's playoffs, Anthony Edwards is averaging 32.3 points on 54.7% shooting with 6.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists on 39.5 minutes on the floor.\n\nIn Game 2 of their Western Conference semifinals match against the Denver Nuggets, Edwards had 27 points on 64.7% shooting with seven assists and two steals in the Timberwolves' 106-80 rout.\n\nChris Finch on Anthony Edwards-Michael Jordan comparisons\n\nWhen asked about his young star, Timberwolves Head Coach Chris Finch lauded Anthony Edwards for his ability to rise to the occasion, but noted that the Michael Jordan comparisons are still long ways away despite Edwards showing certain flashes of brilliance and being able to rise to the occasion under the spotlight (jump to 4:28).\n\n\"Stylistically, [the Michael Jordan comparisons] might be [fair]. I think there's a long way to go, of course, in terms of championship level, sustainability, and all that,\" Finch said on The Dan Patrick Show. \"The confidence is there, the swagger is there...I can tell you that it's 100 percent real.\"\n\n\"He's never shied away from the moment, that was apparent early on...you never know how a young player is gonna react, some players take years to try to figure out in the playoffs. But that's not been the case for him...the bigger the game, the more he relishes it.\"\n\nAmong the traits Edwards possesses is his ability to be self-aware of his weaknesses and being open to improve his game, says Finch. Despite his ability to perform his best under the limelight, there are certain moments in which the 22-year old has a hard time to lock in his focus.\n\n\"One thing that's really great about coaching Ant [is that] he'll still be honest and tell you what he doesn't know, tell you what he needs to be better at, his self-awareness is very high. He's a bit of an old soul that way,\" Finch noted.\n\n\"Sometimes with Anthony, it's harder to get him focused and revved up for a game in February on a Tuesday night. Those are some of the challenges he has a hard time motivating himself. But if it's a big moment, he's always gonna be there.\"\n\nAnthony Edwards deflecting Michael Jordan comparisons\n\nStephen A. Smith exclaimed that Edwards is \"the best two-way guard\" in the NBA right now, on top of the ESPN analyst's bold proclamation that he is comparable to all-time greats Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant.

Their highlight plays are mesmerizing and can be eerily similar at times.\n\nThat similarity in style extends past their dunking feats. Whether intentional or not, Edwards is looking more and more like Jordan with every passing day.\n\nThe younger superstar is pulling from MJ's playbook, in terms of moves, defense and attitude.\n\nMORE: Edwards earns Nikola Jokic's praise, Jordan comps after Timberwolves win Game 1\n\nJordan dominated right off the bat due to his sheer speed and leaping ability. But if there was one shot that defined the second half of his career, it was his post fadeaway. It was completely unstoppable and helped him lead the league in scoring through his 30s after his legs had started to age.\n\nJordan's success with his fadeaway was based on three things. First, he was way ahead of the curve when it came to strength training. He used that power to back down players and create separation. Second, he had amazing footwork, using counters so that defenders couldn't sit on his moves. And third, he still had good hops, which allowed him to get that shot off in traffic.\n\nEdwards has all three of those components as well. He can absolutely muscle defenders down low, and that MJ fade has become a go-to shot for him down the stretch of close games.\n\nThe similarity in technique between the two is uncanny. It's no wonder that fans are wondering if the two are related.\n\nMORE: The photo that made Anthony Edwards-Michael Jordan parallels impossible to ignore\n\nJordan is remembered primarily as an electric scorer, but he could defend. He made nine All-Defensive teams and won the Defensive Player of the Year award in 1988.\n\nJordan didn't start getting that defensive recognition until his fourth season. Edwards is on a similar trajectory.\n\nEdwards was known first and foremost as a scorer through his first three seasons. His on-ball defense started to pick up at the end of his third year, but he was thought of as a poor defender overall because he made far too many mistakes away from the ball.\n\nEdwards has embraced that defensive challenge in his fourth year, asking for the toughest assignments at the end of games. Jaren Jackson Jr. was destroying the Wolves earlier in the season, making it look like Memphis was poised for a big upset. Edwards asked to guard the much bigger forward, completely locking him down in the fourth quarter to lead Minnesota to a comeback win.\n\n\"I have nights like this all the time where somebody gets hot or their best player gets hot and I shut them down the rest of the game,\" Ant said afterward.\n\nEdwards has done the same against the Nuggets to start the team's second-round series, surprisingly taking on the Jamal Murray assignment. He forced Murray into a tough 6-of-14 shooting night in Game 1, limiting him to just 17 points and sticking like glue to him.\n\nJordan used to do the same in the playoffs, taking on some of the toughest guard matchups one-on-one. Doc Rivers called him \"a suffocating defender.\"\n\n\"You're bringing the ball up thinking, 'Man, is this guy even going to let me get over half court?' It was unbearable,\" he told ESPN's Jackie MacMullan back in 2020.\n\nBoth Edwards and Jordan use their intense competitiveness to fuel that defensive effort. They look for any edge that they can get.\n\nEdwards clearly does not back down from anyone. He had one of the most viral moments of these playoffs after going at Kevin Durant, who he looked up to growing up.\n\nEdwards has even trash-talked about a potential matchup with a prime MJ. In an interview with Complex, he noted that he was nowhere near Jordan, then almost immediately followed up with a declaration that Jordan wouldn't be able to guard him in a one-on-one game.\n\nJordan's jawing was, of course, the stuff of legends. Nobody was spared from his wrath, not even extras on the set of Space Jam. Even into his 60s, MJ was still trash-talking current players in the league like Brandon Miller.\n\nBoth players have earned him the respect of their peers despite the trash talk.

Here are his 10 best.\n\nAs the face of the Minnesota Timberwolves, there's no doubt that Anthony Edwards is one of the top rising stars in the NBA today. Many basketball fans will also agree that the two-time All-Star is a walking human highlight reel, thanks to his ability to just dunk on nearly everybody.\n\nIn fact, there have been a handful of victims that Edwards placed on the poster. But aside from poster dunks, Edward surely loves to punish the rims in more ways than one. Let's rank Anthony Edwards' 10 most powerful dunks.\n\nAny regular player would've been checked by the defense of the Memphis Grizzlies' Xavier Tillman. But despite being forced to pick up his dribble, Edwards made something out of nothing by pulling off a self alley-oop play. The All-Star guard capped off the night with 28 points, five rebounds, and five assists in the 118-103 victory.\n\n9. Doug McDermott gets out of Anthony Edwards' way\n\nWhen Ant-Man finds an open lane, every opposing team player must brace themselves and clear the path. The Pacers' Doug McDermott pretty much got the idea but found out a tad too late. Although Edwards had a rough night in the loss with eight points on 3-of-15 shooting, the dunk was a clear silver lining in the 134-128 loss.\n\nWhile Edwards loves finding an open lane, he also doesn't seem to mind dunking over anyone that's in his way. Just ask Robert Covington, who was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Despite Covington being a few inches taller, Edwards just soared over him for a powerful dunk.\n\nAlthough Edwards doesn't necessarily have the height to dominate the offensive glass, the Timberwolves star does know how to clean up a mess in dominant fashion. In a game against the San Antonio Spurs, Edwards climbed up in \"escalator style\" to just dunk on the Spurs for the impressive putback off a Jaden McDaniels missed 3-pointer.\n\n6. Anthony Edwards going baseline\n\nEarly in the 2023-24 season, the Timberwolves got a convincing victory over the Golden State Warriors, 116-110. The Wolves were led by Edwards, who erupted for 33 points and seven assists.\n\nHowever, it's safe to say that the highlight of the night was Edwards dunking over the Warriors after the defense allowed him to get loose at the baseline. Unfortunately for Dario Saric, the Croatian big man suffered the most damage from the dunk.\n\n5. Anthony Edwards goes upstairs\n\nThe Pistons were cellar dwellers in the 2023-24 season despite the lucrative hiring of coach Monty Williams. Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards didn't mind adding more salt to their wounds after just about dunking on the Pistons with one hand after finding an open lane.\n\nIt's safe to say Jalen Duren won't be forgetting about that one so easily. Edwards scored 27 points to go along with five rebounds and eight assists.\n\n4. Alperen Sengun left helpless by Anthony Edwards\n\nThere's no doubt that Alperen Sengun is one of the Houston Rockets' breakout stars, especially before his injury. However, that didn't matter when Edwards came face to face with him in the paint. After driving past the top of the key, Edwards met a 7-foot Sengun in the air. Unfortunately for the Rockets center, the two-time All-Star brought the hammer to finish with authority.\n\n3. Anthony Edwards dunking over Yuta Watanabe\n\nArguably the dunk that cemented Edwards' high-flying prowess, the two-time All-Star showed no mercy against Japanese big man Yuta Watanabe. Watanabe is often known for his defensive tenacity and shot-blocking.\n\nUnfortunately for him, Edwards managed to drive the baseline and completed the play with a jump over Watanabe's outstretched arms to pull off an explosive dunk over him. The dunk easily went viral, and Ant-Man cemented his place as one of the best dunkers of the game.\n\n2. Anthony Edwards has 'signature slam' against Suns\n\nEdwards put on a show in a first-round sweep of the Phoenix Suns in the 2024 NBA Playoffs. He averaged 31.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 6.3 assists. In the final minutes of Game 4, Edwards threw down a thunderous dunk over the Suns' Kevin Durant in what TNT announcer Ian Eagle excitedly called, \"a signature slam!\"\n\n1. Anthony Edwards puts John Collins on a poster\n\nAt 6-foot-9 and 226 pounds, many basketball fans will agree that John Collins isn't a small player. Moreover, his defense is quite solid against his counterparts.\n\nHowever, in transition, Edwards just didn't mind Collins one bit. The Timberwolves star decided to cut through the open lane and dunked it over a standing Collins with no regard for human life. The thunderous dunk is easily in the running for dunk of the year.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Wolves now have a 2-0 lead with the series heading back to Minnesota.\n\nEdwards has heard the comparisons to Michael Jordan that are ever so popular right now. The 22-year-old Wolves guard is roughly the same build at MJ, has similarly nuclear athletic ability, and hit shots that look like a carbon copy of the GOAT. As the Wolves were coasting to a Game 2 win, Edwards hit another amazing shot and immediately started shrugging and grinning. Watch the clip here:\n\nEdwards said before Game 2 that he doesn't want to be compared to Jordan, but it sure looked like he knew what he was doing by going to the shrug after a tough shot.\n\nNine years before Edwards was born in 2001, Jordan famously shrugged after hitting one of his six three-pointers against the Portland Trail Blazers in the 1992 NBA Finals. Keep in mind that Jordan, at the peak of his powers that season, only hit 27 three-pointers total during the regular season. While six threes in a game might not seem that notable anymore, it was amazing back in '92.\n\nIt's hard to ignore the comparison:\n\nBasketball is a global game, but there's only one country in the world that could produce a player like Anthony Edwards. He has the bounce, the shooting touch, and the tenacity of someone like Jordan or Kobe Bryant, the players who created the mold by which we judge the shooting guard position.\n\nEdwards has a long, long way to go before there's any real comparison to MJ, but the important thing is he strikes a similar feeling among fans. He's too strong, too fast, and jumps too high for anyone to credibly defend. What he's doing to Nuggets wing Kentavious Caldwell-Pope in this series feels as similarly cruel to the way Jordan used to abuse defenders in the '90s.\n\nEdwards might say he doesn't want to be compared to MJ, but he fully leaned into it by doing the shrug.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ricky_o_donnell@sbnation.com", "name": "Ricky O'Donnell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Trail_Blazers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portland Trail Blazers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentavious_Caldwell-Pope", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentavious Caldwell-Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nNjLnzHrKaaTpc15xRYEXSrXGww=/0x41:1126x604/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25436987/Screen_Shot_2024_05_07_at_8.55.51_AM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Along the way, he allegedly engaged in demonstrative discourse, asserting his presence and adding excitement to what projects to be a back-and-forth series.\n\nEdwards finished with a playoff career-high and franchise postseason-record 43 points, seven rebounds, three assists, two blocks and three 3-pointers on 58.6% shooting. Meanwhile, the Timberwolves secured a crucial road win to steal home-court advantage from the second-seeded Nuggets.\n\nOn Sunday, alleged leaked audio from Edwards' sensational Game 1 outing went viral on X/Twitter. In the clip, the two-time All-Star engages in a back-and-forth exchange with Denver star point guard Jamal Murray.\n\nMurray reacts excitedly upon discovering that Edwards is defending him, purportedly saying, \"Oh, you got me? This is gonna be fun.\" Edwards concurs before proceeding to play lockdown defense on Murray and staring him down. He then drills a 3-pointer in his face and runs back up the floor allegedly yelling, 'Oh, yeah!\"\n\nLater in the video, Edwards attempts to shoot a jumper over Nuggets shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Caldwell-Pope appears to slap him across his forearms but no call is made. Edwards reacts by allegedly saying, \"That motherf**ker just smacked both of my arms. Damn.\"\n\nIt's only been one game, however, it appears Edwards isn't lacking confidence against the defending champions. If the 22-year-old can continue his elite Round 2 play, he will likely further establish himself as one of the NBA's top players and arguably the league's brightest young star.\n\nAlso Read: \"He's a human highlight reel.\": Stephen A Smith gets even more reasons to wax lyrical on Anthony Edwards\n\nDespite alleged NSFW Game 1 discourse, Anthony Edwards pays respect to Nuggets postgame\n\nWhile Anthony Edwards made a strong on-court statement with his Game 1 dominance and alleged NSFW discourse against Denver, he showed respect postgame.\n\nEdwards again referred to Nuggets superstar center Nikola Jokic as the NBA's top player.

He had sat in front of his locker room mirror after Game 3, confronting the reality that the Denver Nuggets were one game away from knocking the Minnesota Timberwolves out of the playoffs in four games.\n\nSo when the Timberwolves blew a 12-point lead with 2:52 left in the game, forcing overtime, Edwards decided he had to take over. Denver rallied in the fourth quarter and mounted a threat in overtime, but Edwards staved them off. With 11.5 seconds left in the game, he shimmied away from Aaron Gordon and hit a three-pointer that clinched the game.\n\n\"I wasn't passing the ball,\" Edwards said. \"I was taking the shot. I was going to live with whether I lost us the game or we won. I end up hitting the shot.\"\n\nHowever, Edwards missed the game-tying three-pointer in the next game, and the Nuggets eliminated the Wolves in five games. Edwards has shown growth since then. He's quick to complement his teammates in interviews this year and more willing to share the ball. Edwards drives winning for Minnesota like he did with 43 points in Game 1 this year. Still, he knows he can't will the Timberwolves to the second round on his own.\n\n\"Just the whole team, we trust each other,\" Edwards said after Minnesota's 106-99 Game 1 win in Denver. \"It doesn't matter down the stretch who takes the shot; just find the open guy. Everybody put the work in, and I trust my teammates, so I can't wait to pass it to them if they're open.\"\n\nEdwards can score in ways reminiscent of Michael Jordan, but he also continues to evolve as a playmaker. He sees the court better than he did last year, and he passes better off double-teams. Kyle Anderson said he saw the transformation early in the season when Edwards would have 35-point games and still come close to having ten assists.\n\n\"I've seen that about a month and a half or two months ago when he started making the right play,\" said Anderson. \"Like damn the shots that he takes and makes. Like, he started making the right play, making the right pass, getting off it early. And that just opened up his offense.\n\n\"He's done a tremendous job of totally transforming his mindset and transforming his game into, 'I'm gonna make the right play. I'm gonna make my teammates better, and I'm gonna go get mine as well.'\"\n\nIt's one thing for Edwards to trust his teammates when they're scoring. It's another when Denver holds Rudy Gobert (6), Nickeil Alexander-Walker (5), Anderson (2), and Jaden McDaniels (0) to single digits. Naz Reid also only had two points until his 14-point outburst in the fourth quarter. Still, Edwards said he'll continue to try and get his teammates involved, even on a slow night.\n\n\"These guys are going to make shots,\" said Edwards. \"Everybody is going to miss shots. I'm going to miss shots. I'm not going to make all my shots. I don't care how many shots they're going to miss. If they're open, I'm going to pass it every single time. I see the work that they put in.\"\n\nMicah Nori coached Game 1 with Chris Finch sidelined by a knee injury. He said that Edwards spoke up in the locker room at halftime with the Wolves trailing 44-40. Edwards was carrying the team with 25 points at halftime, and he encouraged his teammates to stay aggressive in a hostile road environment.\n\n\"He's become more vocal,\" said Nori. \"Obviously, you have some great vets on our team with KAT, with Rudy, with Kyle, who do most of the talking. However, when Ant speaks, they all listen for sure, and they know that he's all-in, and all he is is positive. 'Naz, keep shooting.' 'Nickeil, we need you.'\"\n\nNot only is Edwards goading his teammates into shooting more, but it also allows them to feel comfortable in their roles. Gobert, McDaniels, and Alexander-Walker are good enough defensively to contribute to winning without scoring.\n\n\"It's different. It's the playoffs now,\" said McDaniels at practice the next day. \"It's win or go home type of thing. So I mean, just gotta affect the game in other ways. We've got plenty of scorers, so I'm not tripping that I scored zero. I still affected the game on defense. That's what I'm here for.\"\n\nStill, the Wolves can't fully tap into Edwards' superpowers unless he gets more scoring support. Reid played a vital role in Game 1 by scoring 14 points in the fourth quarter. Karl-Anthony Towns (20) and Mike Conley (14) provided significant secondary scoring. But as much as McDaniels and Alexander-Walker change the game with their defense, the Wolves can't fully activate Edwards until they contribute offensively.\n\nEdwards' superpower isn't that he can score 40-plus points in a playoff game or dunk like Jordan. That drives winning, but he can't carry the Timberwolves by himself. His superpower is creating gravity and making scoring easier for everyone around him. It's not that he can take and make the last shot. It's that he's willing to find the open man.", "source": {"uri": "zonecoverage.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zone Coverage"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_schreier@zonecoverage.com", "name": "Tom Schreier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Anderson_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Anderson (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naz_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naz Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_McDaniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaden McDaniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickeil_Alexander-Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nickeil Alexander-Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://zonecoverage.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_23191784_168390100_lowres-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Downing-USA TODAY Sports / Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards is thriving in the NBA playoffs, even drawing comparisons to Michael Jordan, arguably the greatest of all-time also known as the G.O.A.T.\n\nEdwards is averaging 32.3 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 1.8 steals on 54.7 percent shooting and 41.9 percent shooting from three-point range through six games. The Wolves are up 2-0 in their Western Conference Semifinals series against the reigning champion Denver Nuggets. Here's what Edwards said regarding the comparisons to the Chicago Bulls legend.\n\n\"I want it to stop,\" Edwards told FOX Sports. \"He's the greatest of all time. I can't be compared to him.\"\n\nEdwards is exceeding all expectations at 22 years old despite being a former No. 1 pick. The Wolves have appeared unstoppable in thus far, taking down the Nuggets in Game 2 without one of their top players, Rudy Gobert. However, he doesn't stack up to the dominance that Jordan displayed at the same age. In the 1986 playoffs, the Hall of Famer averaged 43.7 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.3 steals on 50.5 percent shooting. It's clear Edwards has a long way to go before entering any conversations about being on a similar level as Jordan.\n\nOn the alternative, Jordan is reportedly embracing the comparison.\n\n\"I reached out to the G.O.A.T. today, Michael Jordan. Jordan said there are similarities in their games, and he agreed, so if Jordan says there are similarities, there are similarities,\" Chris Broussard said on an episode of First Things First.\n\nAnthony Pasciolla is a contributing writer for Back In The Day NBA.

Edwards was excellent as the Minnesota Timberwolves swept the Phoenix Suns in round one, and in the first game of the Western Conference Semifinals, Edwards had his playoff career high in a win over the Nuggets in Denver.\n\nPart of what makes Edwards so good is how much fun he can be when he's cooking. Unfortunately, Reggie Jackson learned this lesson the hard way during Game 2 of Nuggets-Wolves, as he tried to poke the ball away from Edwards while he was dribbling. It didn't work, because Edwards coolly switched his dribble hand while Jackson lunged towards the ball, so he ended up hitting the deck and had both knees hit the ground.\n\nJamal Crawford saying \"that was almost a proposal\" was terrific, but even better was Edwards taking a moment to point right at Jackson after this happened. Kudos to Jackson for continuing to play after this, because if this ever happened to me while I was playing basketball, I would probably make my way to the locker room and then go home immediately.", "source": {"uri": "uproxx.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UPROXX"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_rossignol@uproxx.com", "name": "Derrick Rossignol", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "steven_hyden@uproxx.com", "name": "Steven Hyden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "aaron_williams@uproxx.com", "name": "Aaron Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "wongo_okon@uproxx.com", "name": "Wongo Okon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "megan_armstrong@uproxx.com", "name": "Megan Armstrong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/edwards-reggie.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

The media is fixated on the comparison, especially after the Timberwolves guard's dominant showing against the reigning Champions, the Denver Nuggets. But Reggie Miller disagrees.\n\nThe Hall of Famer compared Edwards to another shooting guard instead. During his appearance on the Dan Patrick Show, Miller said, \"Michael Jordan is one of one...Having said that, I do see some similarities between Michael Jordan and Anthony Edwards. The movement, some of the shots, the fadeaways, how he approaches the defensive side of things, but they're two different players.\"\n\n\"I'm not gonna jump on the bandwagon and say he's the next Jordan... I would say, he's more like Dwyane Wade but with a jump shot... He's more in that Flash category but with a better jump shot,\" he added.\n\nThe TNT analyst admitted that Ant is slowly taking his game more and more closer to that of MJ's. But these comparisons are mostly a broader scheme of the media to find the next Jordan. And Edwards is not in that category, especially because of his size, which is a couple of inches shorter than the Bulls legend.\n\nThe comparison with Wade, however, is pretty apt. Like Edwards, Dwyane Wade was blessed with unmatched athleticism and game-changing explosiveness, which made him difficult to contain. The Miami Heat icon could leave defenders in the rearview mirror with his lightning-quick first step, prompting Shaquille O'Neal to anoint him with the nickname 'The Flash.'\n\nThere are parallels between Wade's and Edwards' physical gifts in that aspect. However, perhaps the most critical similarity between the two is their leadership. At 23, Wade put the Heat on his back, carried them to an NBA title, and won the Finals MVP over Shaq. Similarly, a 22-year-old Edwards is leading his team, which has quite a few experienced vets, to a deep playoff campaign.\n\nAnthony Edwards has yet to make up his mind on how he feels about the Michael Jordan comparisons. In an interview with Complex Magazine in December 2023, he distanced himself from them and claimed that the Chicago Bulls icon is the greatest basketball player ever and he's far from it.\n\nHowever, he embraced the comparison when Kevin Garnett attached a technicality. On an episode of the KG Certified podcast, the Hall of Famer claimed that Edwards was like a rookie Michael Jordan. The Timberwolves star agreed with that assessment, saying,\n\n\"\"I think he's right, for sure. '84 Jordan. He didn't say '96, '97. He said '84. He's finding himself. I agree with that.\"\n\nAfter welcoming the Jordan comparison two months ago, Edwards is back to shooing them away. In an interview with Fox Sports recently, he said,\n\n\"I want it to stop. He's the greatest of all time. I can't be compared to him.\"\n\nEdwards isn't too keen on the pressure and scrutiny that comes with being the 'next Michael Jordan.' He's content with building his unique legacy based on who he is, rather than who he reminds people of.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_mahesh_lokegaonkar@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Jay Mahesh Lokegaonkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_shot_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jump shot (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Patrick_(sportscaster)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Patrick (sportscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIBA_Basketball_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIBA Basketball World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TNT (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Complex Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historians", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historians", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Art_and_Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Art and Graphics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Extreme_Sports/Base_Jumping", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Extreme Sports/Base Jumping", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Jumps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Jumps", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/4602e49f-nba-2024-05-07t174837.028.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Smith And Dion Waiters During His Rookie Season", "body": "Anthony Edwards is now regarded as one of the best players in the NBA, but not everyone was so high on him during his rookie season. Edwards had been selected with the first pick of the 2020 NBA Draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves and toward the end of the 2020-21 campaign, The Ringer's Zach Kram shared his top five player comparisons for him.\n\n\"(1) Coby White, (2) J.R. Smith, (3) Collin Sexton, (4) Dion Waiters, (5) Jordan Crawford.\"\n\nThe issue with Edwards as a rookie was that he was the classic case of high usage but low efficiency. He averaged 19.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.5 blocks per game but shot 41.7% from the field and 32.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nKram stated that Edwards had to up that efficiency and be better at creating for his teammates to improve his standing and well, he has done just that. In the 2023-24 season, the 22-year-old averaged 5.4 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.3 steals, and 0.5 blocks per game while shooting 46.1% from the field and 35.7% from three.\n\nEdwards then took things up another notch in these playoffs. The two-time All-Star is putting up 33.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 1.8 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game while shooting 53.2% from the field and 43.6% from beyond the arc. Safe to say, that none of the five players he was compared to, would be able to play this well.\n\nSmith was a fine role player in the NBA while Waiters was basically a journeyman. Coby White, who finished runner-up for Most Improved Player this season, is probably the only one of the five who might end up making an All-Star team, which shows how off-base the comparisons were.\n\nWhile I understand Kram's logic to an extent, I think it shows that you can't always accurately predict how good a player will be based on their rookie season. It can be seen when you consider some of the other player comparisons he did.\n\nThe players LaMelo Ball was compared to, were Steve Francis, Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Jordan Clarkson, and Ja Morant. With the exception of Clarkson, all four are multi-time All-Stars, which is what Ball is expected to be as well.\n\nWhile that was on point, player comparisons for another All-Star from that 2020 NBA Draft weren't. Tyrese Haliburton's top five comparisons were Milos Teodosic, Malcolm Brogdon, Leandro Barbosa, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Steve Blake. None of them were ever close to being All-Stars while Haliburton is one of the best point guards in the league now.\n\nAnthony Edwards Claimed He Would Be The Best Player In The League In 2-3 Years\n\nThe thing that stands out the most about Edwards off the court is his unwavering confidence in his own abilities. He believes he can get the better of anybody and right before these playoffs started, Edwards claimed he would be the best player in the NBA in two to three years.\n\nI didn't think that was all that realistic, as the likes of Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo, are still a couple of levels ahead of him and would still be in their prime then. At least for one playoff game against Jokic, though, Edwards was the best player on the court. He recorded 43 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 steal, and 2 blocks against the Denver Nuggets in Game 1 to lead the Timberwolves to a 106-99 win on the road.\n\nSuppose Edwards and the Timberwolves knock out Jokic and the Nuggets. In that case, I think conversations will have to start about whether he deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the Serb and Antetokounmpo.\n\nRelated: Warriors Didn't Want To Draft Anthony Edwards Because Of Concerns About His Drive And Enthusiasm For Winning\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

He picked up where he left off when Minnesota topped Denver on Saturday, but he wants people who've started comparing him to Michael Jordan to take things down a notch.\n\nThere's a reason the Minnesota Timberwolves decided to use the top overall pick in the 2020 NBA Draft to select Anthony Edwards, and it didn't take him very long to prove he'd be able to live up to the hype he'd managed to drum up during his lone season at the University of Georgia.\n\nThe 6'4'' shooting guard averaged 19.3 points per game during his inaugural campaign and has seen that number improve every single year going forward (a feat he's also been able to match on the assists front).\n\nIn 2024, he earned a spot in the All-Star Game for the second time while helping the Timberwolves punch their ticket to the playoffs and headed into the postseason hoping to advance past the first round for the first time since joining the team (a feat that franchise hadn't been able to achieve since making it to the Western Conference Finals in 2004).\n\nThe T-Wolves were able to do exactly that thanks in no small part to Edwards, who went on an absolute tear over the course of their four consecutive wins against the Suns. He averaged 33 PPG in a sweep where Minnesota was barely tested by Phoenix, and he proved it was anything but a fluke by scoring 43 points against the Nuggets in their 106-99 victory in Game 1.\n\nIt's probably a bit early to start comparing the 22-year-old Edwards to Michael Jordan, but Stephen A.

If we had the No. 1 pick, we wouldn't take you.' And I was just like, 'Damn, that's crazy.' \"\n\nHe's already been traded by Golden State and is now a backup big man for the Detroit Pistons, who went 14-68 and were the NBA's worst team this season.\n\nFour years later, Edwards has been praised by everyone from Charles Barkley to Durant.\n\n\"So impressed with Ant,\" Durant said. \"My favorite player to watch.

They're here. They're killers. They're legit title contenders, and Edwards is one of the best players in the world.\n\nFollowing the Game 2 demolition of the defending champs in their own house, much of the focus has (rightfully) been spent praising Minnesota's defense. Nickeil Alexander-Walker is the best screen navigator on the planet, and Jaden McDaniels isn't far behind. Naz Reid, Karl-Anthony Towns and Kyle Anderson have done a wonderful job holding their ground inside against Nikola Jokic. Mike Conley has great hands and is never in the wrong spot. Did I mention that they did this without four-time Defensive Player of the Year Rudy Gobert on the court for a single minute of action in Game 2?\n\nHowever, this Wolves' squad wouldn't be getting this shine without Edwards -- a ferocious on-ball defender in his own right.\n\nDespite all the praise lathered on the Minnesota defense, it's \"only\" ranked fifth on a per-possession basis amongst playoff teams, while the Wolves' playoff offense is the unit ranked first among all teams, per Cleaning the Glass. Averaging 35 points on 67.8 true shooting percentage through the first two games of the series, Edwards is the driving force behind this suddenly elite scoring unit, and \"driving\" is a very appropriate word in this case.\n\nEdwards has made a living attacking the rim with fierce downhill drives through the first two games. More specifically, Edwards is targeting Jokic, and driving right at him over and over again. Often, it's done by bringing Jokic's man to set the ball screen for Edwards. Other times, it's simply by blowing past the Nuggets' first line of defense and trusting Jokic can't hold up on the back line. Either way, Edwards is having a field day when he sees the two-time (and very likely soon-to-be three-time) MVP at the rim.\n\nBy-and-large, Jokic is a good defender. He's tall and strong, his hand-speed and reaction time to get rebounds and deflections are second to none, and he's progressively gotten better at moving in space as he's shed weight over the past half-decade.\n\nBut he still has one major weakness on that end: his contests at the rim. Jokic simply doesn't have the vertical lift to erase and alter shots at the rim like other great defensive anchors do. The Nuggets built a good if not great defense the past few seasons by surrounding Jokic with terrific athletes and preventing all free-runs to the rim in the first place. But now, they're facing Edwards, who is far too explosive for even the best athletes on Denver's team to keep him in front, and Jokic isn't capable of cleaning up any of those breakdowns at the rim.\n\nTry and put one of the NBA's best wing defenders in Kentavious Caldwell-Pope on him to slow down the onslaught? Edwards simply takes the lighter KCP to the post and shoots over him.\n\nGive Gordon the defensive matchup to show Edwards more size and length? The Wolves simply clear out and let Edwards rev up his engine to blow right past the slower forward.\n\nSure, some of Edwards' jumpers can be chalked up to an unsustainable hot streak. Sometimes the Nuggets are playing great defense and a shot just goes in. But the bigger problem for Denver is just how comfortable Edwards looks. He knows what he wants to do against Caldwell-Pope. He knows how he wants to attack Gordon. He knows he can easily maneuver around Jokic at the rim. At all times, Edwards is confident he can score, because he's already seen that the Nuggets don't have a good answer for him.\n\nThese first two games versus Denver have also been a credit to a growth in mindset from Edwards himself. In his previous two playoff appearances, he was far too willing to let his opponents off the hook by shooting contested jumpers instead of bulling his way to the rim. Edwards is one of the most explosive athletic forces the NBA has seen since the turn of the century. When he puts his head down and hits the accelerator, the number of defenders who can stop him can probably be counted on one hand.\n\nAfter taking only 36.4% of his field goal attempts in the paint against the Memphis Grizzlies during the 2021-22 NBA playoffs, and 45.6% of them in the paint against the Nuggets a year ago, a whopping 56.5% of Edwards' 46 field goal attempts in the first two games of this current series have come directly in the paint.\n\nEdwards still shoots plenty from outside. He's 4-for-11 on threes in this series, and his step-back triple into the Jordan shrug was a defining moment of Game 2. You can't give him the Ben Simmons treatment. You can't stash a center on him like opponents do against Josh Giddey. Edwards still shoots a lot of jumpers and makes a lot of jumpers. The difference is that pulling up outside the paint is his plan B now. Plan A is driving at the bucket at full-speed and causing a unique form of terror to every defender in the area.\n\nThe Nuggets are far from finished in this series, and the Wolves' work is far from complete.

With a number of remarkable high-flying performances that remind fans of MJ, many have compared the style of play between the two. Of course, on the flip side some feel as though these comparisons may be premature.\n\nCount former No. 1 pick Kenyon Martin in the latter category. After spending a number of years watching Jordan, and even a few playing against MJ in the twilight years of the six-time champ's career, he feels as though the Jordan- Edwards comparisons need to stop.\n\nAs he explained on a recent edition of SiriusXM NBA Radio, fans should appreciate Anthony Edwards' play on its own. This sentiment has been expressed by many fans throughout the years, specifically regarding the GOAT debate, in hopes of appreciating individual greatness without comparing eras.\n\n\"First and foremost, I hate comparisons. Everybody's different. Michael Jordan. Michael Jordan. Nobody's ever going to be Michael Jordan. So let's stop this.\n\n\"Anthony Edwards is a great young talent in this league and he's making a name for himself in this NBA and he has a bright, bright future competitive nature, you could probably go with that. But it's too early, man. Kids, 22 years old. Let's take him out of the microwave society and let's let him enjoy this success\"\n\nLooking at how Anthony Edwards has reacted to the Michael Jordan-Anthony Edwards comparisons\n\nAs previously mentioned, the Edwards-Jordan comparisons have been running rampant in recent weeks. Between Anthony Edwards' athletic style of play, midrange game, and competitive nature, it's understandable that people see similarities between the two.\n\nWhile they both have nuances to their games that make them unique, many, including Kendrick Perkins see the similarities. In the case of Perkins, he notably took things a step further on ESPN, indicating that Anthony Edwards is the next Michael Jordan.\n\nFrom the sounds of things, much like Kenyon Martin indicated, Edwards isn't interested in the comparisons. Speaking to FOX Sports, he indicated that he even wants the comparisons to stop.\n\n\"I want it to stop. He's the greatest of all time. I can't be compared to him. ... It's just not possible.\"\n\nDespite that, many other NBA veterans believe that the Edwards- Jordan comparisons are warranted, simply just based on their style of play. Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett noted his slashing abilities, while Charles Barkley noted his fierce competitive nature reminiscent of both Jordan and Kobe Bryant.\n\nAccording to Edwards' trainer, who spoke in the aforementioned FOX Sports article, the young Timberwolves star didn't grow up watching MJ play. Given that, the similarities in the styles of play between the two seem to be natural, making them all the more fascinating to analysts and fans alike.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "evan_bell@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Evan Bell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyon_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenyon Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Perkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Perkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/e40f8-17151861899552-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

But despite the Warriors' apparent concerns about Edwards, it's worth noting the Timberwolves weren't too confident either, reportedly trying to trade out of the No. 1 slot before the draft.\n\nNow, as Wiseman tries to find his way in The Motor City, Edwards is averaging 33.4 points, 7.8 rebounds and 5.6 assists for the Wolves across five 2024 playoff games. Minnesota, led by Edwards, swept the Phoenix Suns in the opening round and currently holds a one-game-to-none lead over the defending-champion Denver Nuggets in the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nAnd, ironically enough, Edwards admitted he might not be where he is today if it weren't for some criticism from Warriors coach Steve Kerr. After a pre-draft workout with Golden State, Kerr told Edwards he \"wasn't working hard enough.\"\n\n\"[Kerr's] like, 'Man, you've got to see Steph [Curry], [Kevin Durant] and Klay [Thompson] work out,' \" Edwards said. \"They still was continuously telling me, 'You didn't work hard enough. If we had the No. 1 pick, we wouldn't take you.' And I was just like, 'Damn, that's crazy.' ...\n\n\"Me and my trainer [were] riding home after dinner and we're just talking like we got to pick it up. I don't know how, I don't know what we got to do, but we got to pick it up. After that, I became a madman at the gym.\"\n\nThat madman mentality certainly has paid off for Edwards, and he partly has Kerr -- and however the Warriors were feeling pre-draft -- to thank.\n\n\"I just went down and I said, 'Can you go a little harder?' \" Kerr recalled this past November of the moment. \"[Edwards] kind of looked at me like, 'Yeah, OK' and they started going a little harder. We ended up going back there a couple weeks later and we went to dinner and he told me, 'Hey, thanks for saying that. I didn't realize how hard I needed to work or what I needed to show.' \"\n\nNow, Edwards and Kerr will look to recreate some of those learning lessons as the Team USA coach and Timberwolves star link up in the Paris Olympics.

Helping the Minnesota Timberwolves finish as the third seed in a hardened Western Conference, Ant-Man received a lot of praise and respect from NBA players, analysts, and even some legends. But to draw comparisons between Edwards and the great Michael Jordan? That is something former Warriors head coach Mark Jackson just can't seem to get on board with.\n\nMark Jackson, along with his son Mark Jackson Jr., better known by his moniker 'Bluu', recently had a pretty strong debate on the comparisons being drawn between the Minnesota Timberwolves guard and the Chicago Bulls legend.\n\nOn a recent episode of his podcast; Night Mode, Jackson and his son went back and forth on this topic. Bluu wanted to show love to a young Anthony Edwards while Mark Jackson wanted these comparisons to stop entirely.\n\n\"You don't get an argument from me when you say he's (Anthony Edwards) cut from the same cloth. I love his mentality, I love his approach, I love the trajectory that he's on. I'm not disrespecting his greatness and where he's going to wind up but he's not Michael Jordan.\"\n\n\"Before you get to the exit that says Michael Jordan, you gotta pass the exit that says Kobe Bryant. So, what're we jumping to? He's Ant-Edwards. The guy has won one playoff series in his entire life. Let's slow down, pump the brakes, and enjoy the ride. Because he's on his way to do special things. Let's just play it out.\"\n\nWhile Mark Jackson does make an extremely valid point, it is hard to deny the similarities between Edwards and MJ. His footwork in the post, the way he gets his shots off from the midrange, and his high-flying antics, all remind many viewers of Air Jordan.\n\nEven the three-time Sixth Man of the Year award winner Jamal Crawford mentioned how there were similarities between Anthony Edwards' midrange fadeaway to the Los Angeles Lakers' legend, Kobe Bryant. Of course, Kobe was as close to a carbon copy of Michael Jordan as one can get.\n\nComing back to Jackson's argument, he mentioned how before comparing Ant-Edwards to Michael Jordan, he should first be compared to Kobe Bryant, the only player who was as identical to MJ since he retired from the league. He then goes on to say that it is just too early to draw comparisons between him and the greats, given how little he has achieved so far.\n\nJackson may not be completely off, but his perspective on this topic may be just a tad off. Fans, analysts, and legends alike have been comparing the Wolves star to Jordan, not because of what he has won so far. Instead, it is the mentality he has, to pair with his game, that many find to be a throwback to the Bulls legend.\n\nHowever, while that may be a massive compliment, Edwards doesn't yet seem to know how to feel about it.\n\nKevin Garnett was one of the first NBA legends to hype up Anthony Edwards' giving off Michael Jordan vibes. Even though Garnett drew comparisons between Edwards and a 1984 rookie Jordan, Ant-Man did not deny it and seemingly agreed with KG's take.\n\nAlthough, only a few months before Garnett's take, Anthony Edwards did express his desire that the Michael Jordan comparisons be brought to an end as he was nowhere close to what 'Black Jesus' used to do on the hardwood floor.\n\nAs per SportsIllustrated, this is what the Minnesota Timberwolves guard said during an interview. \"I just want (the comparisons) to stop. (Jordan is) the greatest to ever play basketball, and I'm so far from it.\"\n\nWhile he may feel that he is far from MJ, even Mark Jackson believes he is on the trajectory to be one of the greats in the coming days of the NBA.\n\nSweeping the All-Star trio of Kevin Durant, Devin Booker, and Bradley Beal in the very first round of the playoffs, Edwards has already made a mark for himself in the league. And with taking Game 1 of the series against the reigning NBA champions, let's see how far the 22-year-old All-Star leads this Minnesota squad during these playoffs.", "source": {"uri":

Over 32 games at Georgia, there were moments -- more than a couple, but fewer than a slew -- when potential met reality.\n\nThe first came Nov. 20, 2019. The Bulldogs were playing Georgia Tech -- in March 2021, many of these Yellow Jackets became ACC champs -- at Stegeman Coliseum. Junior Rayshaun Hammonds, who'd scored 26 of Georgia's first 56 points, incurred his fourth foul with 10 minutes left and his team leading by eight.\n\nWith Hammonds sitting, Edwards -- who'd scored one basket over the previous 30 minutes -- took the next shot. It was a 3-pointer in transition. He made it. He scored 12 points in 3 1/2 minutes, prompting Tech coach Josh Pastner to say, \"He's a pro ... Pros do that.\"\n\nEight days later, Edwards and the Bulldogs were in Maui. Bill Walton was doing commentary for ESPN. At the half, Georgia trailed Michigan State -- the Spartans of Tom Izzo and Cassius Winston were No. 1 in preseason -- by 21. Edwards had four points. A pre-Thanksgiving audience was thinking, \"Why is he a big deal?\"\n\nThose who stayed tuned saw why. Edwards scored 33 second-half points. From 28 down, the Bulldogs drew within two. Walton was his pragmatic self, asking, \"What was Edwards doing the first half?\" By game's end, one of the greatest-ever college players had come around, asking, \"Why isn't Edwards taking every shot?\"\n\nGeorgia would lose, 93-85. Edwards finished with 37 points, having also made two assists, of which former Spartan Magic Johnson would have been proud. An ESPN camera caught UGA coach Tom Crean half-smiling, prompting Walton to say, \"He's thinking, 'We're going to win a lot of games.' \"\n\nThose Bulldogs finished 16-16. Their last victory came on March 11, the night before the world shut down due to COVID-19. In an 18-point victory over Ole Miss on the first/last night of the 2020 SEC tournament, Edwards scored six points. He took 13 shots, missing 11.\n\nHe'd finish as the conference's third-leading scorer and its freshman of the year. Only twice after Maui would he break 30 points, those in losses at Florida and South Carolina. A season that was supposed to return Georgia and Crean to national prominence ended with a shrug. How could a talent so big make so small a splash?\n\nCOVID pushed the 2020 draft to November. Two days shy of a year after his stunning second half, Edwards was the first player taken. Nobody doubted he could play. Nobody disputed his skills. At no time did Crean, who lasted one more season in Athens, suggest Edwards was difficult to coach, calling him \"one of the greatest teammates I've ever been around.\"\n\nFor all that, we wondered how long it would take Edwards to settle in the NBA. The answer: about 15 minutes. He finished second -- to LaMelo Ball, taken No. 3 in 2020 -- in rookie of the year voting. By his third season, Edwards was an All-Star. Now he acts as if he owns the place.\n\nOn a star-spangled Minnesota roster, he's the unquestioned main man. He scored 40 points in the Timberwolves' closeout of Phoenix and Kevin Durant. Edwards had 43 in the Game 1 victory over Denver. In Monday's Game 2, he made the poised and polished Nuggets look as helpless as Michigan State had been in Maui.\n\nAfter Karl-Anthony Towns staked Timberwolves to an early lead, Edwards did his takeover thing. He flashed past, dribbled between and rose above all would-be defenders. Minnesota led by 26 at halftime. Its lead peaked at 32 points -- this on the road against the reigning champs.\n\nAfter sinking a fourth-quarter trey, Edwards gave the Jordan Shrug. MJ being the GOAT, this seemed a bit much, though here we note: Michael Jordan was 23 when he had his first 40-point playoff game; Edwards, who won't turn 23 until August, has three already.\n\nIn hindsight, we -- I include myself in this -- might have paid too little heed to Edwards' age. He was 17 when he graduated from Atlanta's Holy Spirit Prep. He was 19 years, 5 months and 18 days old when he made his NBA debut. Sahvir Wheeler, part of the same Georgia recruiting class, just finished a fifth season at a third different college.\n\nOn the night in 2019 when Edwards took over against Tech, Crean said: \"We're not even scratching the surface on him.\" Consider that surface scratched. Potential and reality have met, and they're doing a happy dance.\n\n\u00a92024 The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Visit at ajc.com.

The Timberwolves took a 2-0 series lead in the second round of NBA playoffs with a 106-80 win over the Denver Nuggets on Monday to bring Minnesota two wins closer to reaching the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 2004.\n\nEdwards' leap during the 2024 NBA Playoffs has been undeniable. The former No. 1 overall prospect by 247Sports in the 2019 recruiting cycle and the top pick from the 2020 NBA Draft out of Georgia is in his fourth season in the NBA. Edwards is moving up the all-time No. 1 overall recruit leaderboard because of his performances in the postseason -- he had a ho-hum-for-him 27 points Monday night. Edwards is part of the new guard of young talent taking over the NBA postseason and is positioning himself as one of the faces of the league going forward.\n\nIn Game 1 against the Nuggets, Edwards scored 43 points to become the fourth player in NBA history with three consecutive playoff games with at least 35 points. Edwards joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant. Edwards also joined Bryant as the only player with back-to-back 40-point games at age 22 or younger in NBA playoff history.\n\nIn the 247Sports era (2010-), Edwards is one of five former top recruits who were the No. 1 pick in their respective drafts, joining Anthony Davis, Andrew Wiggins, Ben Simmons, and Cade Cunningham. Edwards, Davis, and Simmons are the only players who have already been named multi-time all-stars.\n\nEdwards' path from top recruit to NBA superstar was anything but conventional. Edwards reclassified from the 2020 cycle to what would become a star-crossed 2019 class to join Georgia one season early. Edwards averaged 19.1 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 2.8 during the 2019-20 season at Georgia that was cut short due to COVID-19.\n\n\"Ant's natural scoring ability, combined with his physical gifts, all-around skill set and long-term upside make him a special prospect,\" said then-247Sports Director of Scouting Evan Daniels.\n\nDuring the pre-draft process in 2020, there were question marks surrounding his desire to play basketball. Edwards was a Pop Warner football star in his younger days and expressed before the start of the 2023-24 NBA season his hopes of one day playing in the NFL.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Edwards told Marco Summers on his talk show Open Thoughts. \"I might be the first one (to play in the NFL and NBA.)\"\n\nWhile Edwards may have the tools and athleticism to make a run as a multi-sport athlete, his charisma, high-flying dunks and friendly trash talk have gravitated basketball fans toward the 22-year-old rising star.\n\nHere are the No. 1 overall recruits in the 247Sports era, ranked by NBA success.\n\nNote: The parenthesized year denotes when the player was ranked as the No. 1 overall recruit in his respective class. PER stands for Performance Efficiency Rating, which is an all-encompassing metric used to judge player performance.\n\n1. Anthony Davis (2011)\n\nAll-Star appearances: 8\n\nBest PER: 30.8 (2013-14)\n\nWhen Davis is at his best, he's in the conversation for the best big man in the NBA. In his lone season at Kentucky during the 2011-12 campaign, The Brow put up monster numbers that also have him in the conversation as the best one-and-done prospect in modern college basketball history. Davis was drafted first by the New Orleans Hornets (now the New Orleans Pelicans) in 2012 and spent the first seven years of his career there before being traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2019. Davis averaged 28 and 10 during the Lakers' championship run in the 2020 Bubble. He is an eight-time NBA All-Star, made the All-NBA First Team four times, and appeared on the All-Defensive Team four times. Davis appeared in a career-high 76 games during the 2023-24 campaign for the Lakers.\n\n2. Anthony Edwards (2019)\n\nAll-Star appearances: 2\n\nBest PER: 19.7 (2023-24)\n\nEdwards averaged a career-high 25.9 points during the 2023-24 campaign and made the NBA All-Star team for the second consecutive season. Edwards is one of the most entertaining players in the league to watch because of his frequent highlight reel plays. Edwards ranked ahead of James Wiseman and Cole Anthony in the 247Sports rankings. Edwards assumed the top spot in his class after reclassifying.\n\nHe is well on his way toward earning more accolades at the next level.\n\n3. Ben Simmons (2015)\n\nAll-Star appearances: 3\n\nBest PER: 20.4 (2019-20)\n\nSimmons' NBA career is complicated. The former No. 1 pick in the 2016 NBA Draft quickly rose to stardom after helping the Philadelphia 76ers reach the NBA Playoffs. Simmons reached the NBA All-Star Game three consecutive seasons between 2019-21 and was considered one of the best defenders at his respective position. It's been downhill since. Simmons has appeared in 57 games in the last two seasons due to injuries.\n\n4. Andrew Wiggins (2013)\n\nAll-Star appearances: 1\n\nBest PER: 16.5 (2015-16)\n\nA change of scenery was the best thing for Wiggins' career. Once considered a bust on the Timberwolves, Wiggins proved his ability to be an elite two-way player during Golden State's playoff run in 2022. He is a major reason why the Dubs were able to beat the Celtics in six games after falling behind 2-1 in the series. Wiggins is part of one of the most notable NBA trades to happen this century. The Cavs traded away Wiggins in exchange for Timberwolves star big man Kevin Love to pair with LeBron James and Kyrie Irving, which paid off for Cleveland. Wiggins is coming off one of the worst statical seasons of his career.\n\n5. Chet Holmgren (2021)\n\nAll-Star appearances: 0\n\nBest PER: 20.4 (2023-24)\n\nAfter missing the entire 2022-23 season with injury, Holmgren helped the Oklahoma City Thunder earn the No. 1 seed in the Western Conference. Holmgren finished behind San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama in Rookie of the Year voting but is having a rookie campaign to remember. Holmgren starred at Gonzaga during his lone college season during the 2021-22 campaign and is working his way up the list as one the best all-time No. 1 recruits. His Thunder tip off Round 2 against the Mavericks on Tuesday night. We expect Holmgren to have a loud NBA playoffs.\n\n6. Cade Cunningham (2020)\n\nAll-Star appearances: 0\n\nBest PER: 17.1 (2023-24)\n\nThe first three picks of the 2021 NBA Draft were in the exact order as the final 247Sports rankings from the 2020 recruiting cycle. Cade Cunningham went No. 1 to the Detroit Pistons, Jalen Green was drafted No. 2 by the Houston Rockets, and the Cleveland Cavaliers selected Evan Mobley with the No. 3 pick. Cunningham has flashed some of the tools that made him the top high school recruit and the first pick of the draft, but he is currently part of a Pistons team that just finished with the worst record (14-68) in the league.\n\n7. RJ Barrett (2018)\n\nAll-Star appearances: 0\n\nBest PER: 16.4 (2023-24)\n\nLike Wiggins, a change of scenery may be the best thing for Barrett's career. Barrett was part of a star-studded recruiting class at Duke that included Zion Williamson, Cam Reddish and Tre Jones. After being drafted by the New York Knicks with the No. 3 pick in the 2019 NBA Draft, Barrett was traded this past December to the Toronto Raptors in the OG Anunoby trade. Back in his native Canada, Barrett averaged a career-high 21.8 points in 32 games with Toronto.\n\n8. Marvin Bagley lll (2017)\n\nAll-Star appearances: 0\n\nBest PER: 19.4 (2023-24)\n\nBefore Bagley became the top-ranked player from the 2017 class, current Denver Nuggets star Michael Porter Jr. occupied that spot before Bagley reclassified up. The Kings famously, stupidly, passed on Luka Don\u010di\u0107 with the No. 2 pick in the 2018 NBA Draft and instead went with Bagley. The Kings traded the former Duke star to the Pistons at the 2022 NBA Trade Deadline.\n\n9. Nerlens Noel (2012)\n\nAll-Star appearances: 0\n\nBest PER: 20.4 (2016-17)\n\nOnce projected as the No. 1 overall pick in the lackluster 2013 NBA Draft, Noel fell all the way to No. 6. Noel played for six different NBA teams during his career and was most recently cut by the Sacramento Kings before the start of this past season. Noel only averaged double-digit points once during his time in the league.\n\n10. Emmanuel Mudiay (2014)\n\nAll-Star appearances: 0\n\nBest PER: 14.6 (2018-19)\n\nMudiay is the only player on this list that didn't play in college. After committing to SMU, Mudiay elected to play overseas before being drafted by the Nuggets with the No. 7 pick in the 2015 NBA Draft. Mudiay averaged a career-high 15 points in one of his final seasons during the 2018-19 campaign.\n\n11. Josh Jackson (2016)\n\nAll-Star appearances: 0\n\nBest PER: 14.1 (2019-20)\n\nAfter a standout season at Kansas, Jackson was selected by the Phoenix Suns with the No. 4 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft. Jackson's pure athleticism and shotmaking made him an intriguing project. Jackson never lived up to the hype and last played in the NBA during the 2021-22 season.\n\n12. Nick Smith Jr. (2022)\n\nAll-Star appearances: 0\n\nBest PER: 8.1 (2023-24)\n\nSmith was drafted by the Charlotte Hornets with the No. 27 pick last summer. Smith appeared in 59 games and averaged 5.9 points. While there is still plenty of time for the 20-year-old guard to improve his standing, he is the defacto last-ranked player on this list due to his lack of experience in the NBA. Smith last summer spoke vulnerably about his disappointing year at Arkansas.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

On Tuesday, former NFL star Keyshawn Johnson became the latest analyst to claim that the Minnesota Timberwolves guard reminded him of the Chicago Bulls icon before he also shared an interesting perspective about the discourse. Johnson explained,\n\n\"There's a lot of similarities to Michael [Jordan] in [Anthony Edwards'] game. A whole bunch of them. Whether it's the turnaround, all of a sudden he'll hit a turnaround, which looks like Kobe [Bryant] to me, which looks like Michael. Whether it's, 'I'm falling to the ground, I got fouled, but I'm gonna fall to the ground, double-clutch it, and I'm still gonna be able to stay in the air when everybody else is on the ground, and knock the shot down.' That's Michael. You can't run from that.\"\n\nHowever, despite his initial statement, the NFL legend added that comparing Edwards to the 1998 Jordan, who rode off into the sunset after winning a sixth NBA title in eight years, was incorrect.\n\nInstead, he believes that the Timberwolves star should be compared to 1980s Jordan. By this, he meant that Edwards was closer to the version of MJ that dragged a subpar Chicago Bulls side on his back, while also fighting to become the face of the NBA.\n\nJohnson's analysis is spot on. Edwards may have showcased that he is the top option on his team while battering the defending champions in their own arena in these playoffs. However, he is still a 22-year-old guard, who is likely at least half a decade away from truly hitting his peak.\n\nHis game will continue to get more polished and refined as he gains more experience and he should be allowed to grow, just like Jordan was in the 1980s. Expecting Edwards to operate at the same level that the Bulls icon did in the 1990s is a fool's errand. And pressuring him to buy into the comparison will only add undue pressure on the young star.\n\nThe discourse about the Anthony Edwards and Michael Jordan comparisons has taken a life of its own with many prominent names sharing their view about the Timberwolves star's being the 'next MJ.'\n\nMark Jackson dismissed the notion, Reggie Miller offered an alternate comparison, while Shaquille O'Neal shared video evidence of the similarities between them. While the talking heads can continue to discuss the topic to death, Jordan, the only person whose opinion about the comparison is worth a dime, has already given his verdict.\n\nIn March, ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith revealed that he reached out to the five-time NBA MVP for his take on Edwards. He said on an episode of First Take,\n\nI reached out to the GOAT (Michael Jordan) today. Michael Jordan said there are similarities in their games, he agreed!\"\n\nSmith also excitedly added that Jordan admired the Timberwolves star's game and labeled him 'special'.\n\nAs Edwards continues to ascend to the top of the NBA pyramid, the chatter will only get louder. The more he dominates, the more the comparisons to Jordan will amplify. All he can do is downplay it, work on his game, be the best version of himself, and find success on the court with the Timberwolves.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_mahesh_lokegaonkar@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Jay Mahesh Lokegaonkar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyshawn_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keyshawn Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Take_(talk_show)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Take (talk show)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Smith And Dion Waiters During His Rookie Season", "body": "Anthony Edwards is now regarded as one of the best players in the NBA, but not everyone was so high on him during his rookie season. Edwards had been selected with the first pick of the 2020 NBA Draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves and toward the end of the 2020-21 campaign, The Ringer's Zach Kram shared his top five player comparisons for him.\n\n\"(1) Coby White, (2) J.R. Smith, (3) Collin Sexton, (4) Dion Waiters, (5) Jordan Crawford.\"\n\nThe issue with Edwards as a rookie was that he was the classic case of high usage but low efficiency. He averaged 19.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, 2.9 assists, 1.1 steals, and 0.5 blocks per game but shot 41.7% from the field and 32.9% from beyond the arc.\n\nKram stated that Edwards had to up that efficiency and be better at creating for his teammates to improve his standing and well, he has done just that. In the 2023-24 season, the 22-year-old averaged 5.4 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 1.3 steals, and 0.5 blocks per game while shooting 46.1% from the field and 35.7% from three.\n\nEdwards then took things up another notch in these playoffs. The two-time All-Star is putting up 33.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 1.8 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game while shooting 53.2% from the field and 43.6% from beyond the arc. Safe to say, that none of the five players he was compared to, would be able to play this well.\n\nSmith was a fine role player in the NBA while Waiters was basically a journeyman. Coby White, who finished runner-up for Most Improved Player this season, is probably the only one of the five who might end up making an All-Star team, which shows how off-base the comparisons were.\n\nWhile I understand Kram's logic to an extent, I think it shows that you can't always accurately predict how good a player will be based on their rookie season. It can be seen when you consider some of the other player comparisons he did.\n\nThe players LaMelo Ball was compared to, were Steve Francis, Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Jordan Clarkson, and Ja Morant. With the exception of Clarkson, all four are multi-time All-Stars, which is what Ball is expected to be as well.\n\nWhile that was on point, player comparisons for another All-Star from that 2020 NBA Draft weren't. Tyrese Haliburton's top five comparisons were Milos Teodosic, Malcolm Brogdon, Leandro Barbosa, Bogdan Bogdanovic, and Steve Blake. None of them were ever close to being All-Stars while Haliburton is one of the best point guards in the league now.\n\nAnthony Edwards Claimed He Would Be The Best Player In The League In 2-3 Years\n\nThe thing that stands out the most about Edwards off the court is his unwavering confidence in his own abilities. He believes he can get the better of anybody and right before these playoffs started, Edwards claimed he would be the best player in the NBA in two to three years.\n\nI didn't think that was all that realistic, as the likes of Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo, are still a couple of levels ahead of him and would still be in their prime then. At least for one playoff game against Jokic, though, Edwards was the best player on the court. He recorded 43 points, 7 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 steal, and 2 blocks against the Denver Nuggets in Game 1 to lead the Timberwolves to a 106-99 win on the road.\n\nSuppose Edwards and the Timberwolves knock out Jokic and the Nuggets. In that case, I think conversations will have to start about whether he deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the Serb and Antetokounmpo.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gautam_varier@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Gautam Varier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dion_Waiters", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dion Waiters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Mandatory Credit: Bruce Kluckhohn-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMinnesota Timberwolves have already conquered the Nuggets home, Ball Arena. Anthony Edwards led a defensive masterclass against the Denver side, even in the absence of this year's DPOY, Rudy Gobert. While the series has been humiliating for the defending champs, thus far, Edwards' antics are adding insult to injury, as the 22-year-old has been taking shots at Jamal Murray since before the start of the series.\n\nAfter sweeping the Phoenix Suns in the first round, the Wolves were en route to playing the Nuggets. Before the two matched up, Edwards was asked if he had the same kind of motivation facing the superstar duo of Denver as he did with his childhood idol, Kevin Durant.\n\nEdwards looked \"offended\" at the reporter's question, quickly firing back with an answer,\n\n\"Naah, these guys are three, four years older than me, man.\"\n\nThe Edwards-Durant battle was a seminal moment in the league, signifying the passing of the torch from one generation to the next. For Edwards, the previous series was against a true \"OG\" of the sport, while the upcoming contest didn't possess the same. Murray is more of a peer for Ant-Man. He added,\n\n\"Hell, Naw! Like I said, what is he 27? I am finna, a turn 23 dog, KD 36, 35. Come on, man.\"\n\nMoving forward, Edwards clarified that he meant \"no disrespect\" to Murray, even mentioning that he respected Denver as a team. But when it came to admiration, he didn't seem to attach that tag with Denver, which was visible in the first two games.\n\nOver the first two games against the Nuggets, Edwards has looked unstoppable, as he had a 43-point showing in Game 2. The opponents will have to look for an answer for Edwards soon, as the series is only poised to get tougher for them. On the flip side, the Timberwolves side will look to close out the series at home, similar to their first-round match-up with Pheonix.\n\nIf it was a preview of what was to come, the Nuggets might be the second team to get swept by the Timberwolves this season. The only two teams that appear to be performing at the same level as Minnesota are the New York Knicks and the Oklahoma City Thunder, as a possible Shai-Edwards matchup is looking like a real possibility moving forward.\n\nBut prematurely counting out the Denver Nuggets and this season's MVP Nikola Jokic is not advisable either. Fans expect a comeback from the Denver side, and their counter-punch must include a big performance from Jamal Murray. The 27-year-old has been abysmal since he sent the Lakers home off a buzzer-beater in Game 5 of the first round.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trikansh_kher@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Trikansh Kher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ball Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_State_Wolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern State Wolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/b54f1982-untitled-design-2024-05-09t185925.887.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

This begs the question: Which young NBA star would you want to start your team with?\n\nNow, of course, this is a hypothetical. There are rumors that Seattle may be awarded a new franchise and expansion team in the future, but obviously they don't just get to pick any star player to be the centerpiece of the team. Nonetheless, with some of the performances we've seen from players like New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson and Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards, the question posed here is a tough one.\n\nLet's examine a few different factors. We'll start with the unanimous rookie of the year.\n\nVictor Wembanyama - San Antonio Spurs\n\n\"In 71 games this season, Wembanyama averaged 21.4 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.9 assists, 3.6 blocks and 1.2 steals per game,\" ESPN explained. The last person to hit those numbers was NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal, who did that in 1999. \"Wemby\" is seven-foot-four and was arguably the most intriguing draft prospect last year since LeBron James came out of high school. His size and global recognition are certainly unique, but what makes his game special is how diverse his skillset is. He's incredibly athletic and smooth with the basketball. And the fans love him: his #1 jersey was in the top five of best sellers, which is another angle to consider when picking your team. Wemby is just twenty years old.\n\nAnthony Edwards - Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nBy now, we've seen the thunderous slam dunks from Edwards. Those above-the-rim jams where it appears he is at eye-level with the rim. However, Edwards' best play of the season was a defensive play when he blocked a last-second shot vs. the Indiana Pacers. Edwards' game is filled with intensity. He thrives in big games and has no problem attacking his prey, even if that includes his favorite player growing up, Kevin Durant. Edwards is leading his Wolves team this postseason, having the defending champion Denver Nuggets on the ropes. Edwards is 22-years-old.\n\nJalen Brunson - New York Knicks\n\nWhen you watch these playoff games at Madison Square Garden, a few things from the fans stand out. The first is simply the incredible volume of the crowd all game long. The second is when they chant \"M.V.P.\" when Brunson has the ball. The fearless leader of the Knicks has carried the team on his back all year. They were often counted out due to amassing so many injuries. However, Brunson has excelled as the underdog, hitting clutch shot after clutch shot. He has scored over 40 points in the last four playoff games in a row, after averaging just under 28 points per game during the regular season. He has become beloved in New York and is largely responsible for the team becoming a contender again. Brunson is the senior citizen of the group at 27-years-old.\n\nWriter's Young NBA Star Draft Pick\n\nWhat I love about this question is that all three players have totally different styles of play. Each of them has the ability to sell out the arena each night for years to come. What has sold me, however, is Anthony Edwards being compared to Michael Jordan. So many athletes, in general, get measured up against MJ. Most times it's an irrational comparison, but this one I can actually see. Edwards' \"prime\" years are still ahead of him. He's also the leader of a smaller market franchise that has not won much lately, nor have they ever made it to the finals. If Edwards continues this trajectory, that will certainly change, and those #5 Wolves jerseys will be just as hot as tickets to his games.", "source": {"uri": "sunny1063.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sunny 106.3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_gorra@sunny1063.com", "name": "Jeff Gorra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Wembanyama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Victor Wembanyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Brunson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Brunson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Expansion team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sunny1063.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/62/2024/05/GettyImages-2044270579-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Every franchise knows the feeling of being burned a regrettable decision that in many instances altered its trajectory.\n\nHindsight is genius forever tortured.\n\nThe Warriors have been living with that torture for almost two years.\n\nThey've spent much of that time mentally smacking themselves upside their collective head for a missed opportunity - and the regret has gotten more painful over the past two weeks.\n\nSlapped into the offseason for days before the 2024 NBA playoffs, the Warriors can only watch from afar as Anthony Edwards is earning the privilege of being compared to Michael Jordan and the late Kobe Bryant - while representing the Minnesota Timberwolves instead of Golden State.\n\nEdwards is the Timberwolves' lead exterminator, and they are using these playoffs to establish themselves as the most ferocious team on earth. Now that Edwards is spinning and winning and grinning through the playoffs, everybody loves him. Every team wishes they had their own Ant.\n\nGolden State, according to league and team sources, was presented with an opportunity to draft Edwards in 2020.\n\nThough the Warriors finished with the worst record in the league (15-50) in 2019-20, bad lottery luck dropped them into the No. 2 slot. Minnesota, which had the third-worst record (19-46) jumped Golden State for the rights to the No. 1 overall pick.\n\nThe Timberwolves were willing to swap out of No. 1, but their attempts to engage the Warriors were not successful. Though the Timberwolves correctly believed the Warriors were focused on 7-foot-1 center James Wiseman, Golden State also believed there was no need to move up because Minnesota was focused on Edwards, a 6--foot-4 guard.\n\nThe Warriors did, however, consider Edwards. They scouted him on multiple occasions and came to the same conclusion as most other teams. That he was intriguing, but he was the star of a mediocre team - the 16-16 Georgia Bulldogs - and his effort was inconsistent.\n\nEdwards was on Golden State's draft board, but the name at the top belonged to Wiseman. Both players were 19 years old, but Edwards played 1,057 minutes over 32 games at Georgia while Wiseman put in only 69 minutes over three games at Memphis before he was declared ineligible.\n\nThere were questions about both. But if anyone - including Edwards or the Timberwolves - now insists they knew Edwards would be as remarkable as he has become, dare them to take a polygraph and count how many seconds pass before they fail.\n\nGolden State and Minnesota each chose a player that fit a positional need. The Timberwolves, with Karl-Anthony Towns at center, had little interest in Wiseman. The Warriors, with Stephen Curry as their lead guard, were not of a mind to add Edwards.\n\nWiseman, who turned 23 in March, spent most of this season as the third-string center for the Detroit Pistons, who finished with the worst record (14-68) in the NBA. He remains in development.\n\nEdwards, who turns 23 in August, has appeared in two NBA All-Star Games and will be the youngest member of the Team USA roster chosen for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. He is a leader on a championship contender that features four veterans between the ages of 28 and 36.\n\nThe Timberwolves finished with the third-best record (56-26) in the Western Conference and fourth-best record in the league. They swept the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the playoffs and have a 2-0 lead over the defending champion Denver Nuggets in the conference semifinals.\n\nTeams are finding it is incredibly difficult to score against the Wolves - and impossible to stop Edwards.\n\nThis is not to assign blame within the Golden State organization. The Warriors chose not swap picks with Minnesota because they could get their man at No. 2 without giving up anything else. The Warriors were intoxicated by Wiseman's length, athleticism and potential. The decision to draft him followed the wishes of the majority.\n\nOnly if the Warriors could know then what they know now would they have chosen Edwards over Wiseman. They would have the man with the goods to take the torch from Curry and keep them among the elite. Dr. Hindsight never misses.\n\nThe Warriors can only accept their reality. No playoffs. A desire to regain contender status. And an offseason spent seeking an answer to the question that nagging them before the 2020 draft.\n\nHow can we get better now without sacrificing our future?", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warriors_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Warriors (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Bay_Area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Bay Area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wiseman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Wiseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Bulldogs_and_Lady_Bulldogs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Bulldogs and Lady Bulldogs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scout (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/csnbayarea.com/b5587716325c45c04cb3b9ab48dc2260", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

A sense of fluidity around her endeavors in science, mentorship and activism, intersectional to her identity as a biracial Black woman in academia. As a fifth-year doctoral candidate in the Neuroscience and Behavior program at the University of Massachusetts, questions of people and place are central to her work -- as is her own reflection with the potential for shared identity across communities.\n\nA non-linear path to higher education imbues her story with unique anecdotes of access and adversity, but also overwhelming tenacity. You cannot separate science from the systems by which they are practiced. But Edwards is intent on the dialogue she fosters, the noise she makes and the spaces she works tirelessly to create when envisioning science where scholars who look like her are not only seen, but heard.\n\nWhether researching the impact of aromatase inhibitors like Letrozole on cognitive function, connecting Black youth and underrepresented communities to STEM opportunities, or engaging with feminist literature, Edwards is most confident pursuing models of \"appreciative inquiry,\" where the culmination of individual experiences can compose a stronger whole.\n\nIt is fair to say that moments of stillness are few and far between for Edwards. But at this current moment, Edwards -- traveling between presentations and conferences, wrapping up loose ends before graduation -- is simply just trying, as she says, like everyone else, to retain connections to her work and why they matter outside of an institutional space.\n\nEdwards' research investigates sex differences in disease with a focus on Alzheimer's disease. Her broader interests explore the effects of estrogens and the cytochromes P450 enzyme family on gene expression and cell signaling in the brain.\n\nAs a former member of the Hormones and Cognition lab, Edwards brought RNA-sequencing skills to investigate the effects of the Letrozole on brain gene expression. Her work with common marmoset brain tissue helped her understand how aromatase inhibitors affect cognitive function. Her findings indicated that Letrozole-treated animals showed significant gene expression in the hippocampus of the brain, important for learning and memory.\n\n\"I had to teach myself a lot and find external sources who could help me learn how to design an RNA-seq experiment,\" Edwards said. \"I had never done any aspect of this work before, so I hope this encourages folks who think they have to be experts in everything before applying to graduate school.\"\n\nEdwards is the recipient of the Dissertation Award, issued by the Center for Research on Families, a Ford Foundation Predoctoral Fellow and Spaulding-Smith Fellow among other campus-level, national and international accolades.\n\nNow \"all but dissertated,\" Edwards finds a new opportunity to consider who she is, and what comes next.\n\nAfter earning her bachelor's degree in evolutionary biology, ecology and French at Appalachian State University, her undergraduate research solidified her passion for animals and nature. An internship to study flying squirrels, turtles and other species across the Blue Ridge Parkway further cemented a love for the outdoors.\n\nIt was not until she started her doctorate where self-advocacy and lived experience as a function of activism would position Edwards to think as critically with systems of privilege in academia. Edwards reflected on how she moved through spaces of higher education with a certain consciousness of value systems.\n\nThese systems, as Edwards explains, are baked into the cultural landscape of higher education, reflected in the disproportionate representation of women, Black and Hispanic individuals in science.\n\n\"Being able to obtain one of the highest degrees in the world - a degree that less than two percent of the world has - brings up many mixed emotions for me,\" Edwards said. \"On one hand, I am exceedingly grateful...I was repeatedly told by racially overrepresented scholars that I was a diversity hire and would never be fit for higher education. To make it this far having faced so many systemic and personal struggles from a very young age feels nothing short of miraculous.\"\n\nBeing uncomfortable in a space of higher education is not unfamiliar to Edwards. It is, however, one of Edwards' primary mechanisms to act and pave the way for change. She consciously integrates this idea into her perspectives on finding community.\n\n\"Community is such a beautiful and challenging topic,\" Edwards said. \"When we talk about community, it's important to think about the many different types of communities that exist. There are some that we choose with intention and others we may belong to with varying sense of connection or belonging.\"\n\nThis notion of visibility is the core of Edwards' mentorship model. To be an effective mentor, there's a sense of reciprocity Edwards believes must be curated between mentor and mentee. Edwards is certain of the sheer growth she herself has experienced while becoming a better mentor with time.\n\n\"At the most basic level, I think it is really important to foster an environment where accountability and healthy dialogue aren't feared by people in positions of power or privilege,\" Edwards said. \"Scholars should be able to ask for what they need, share ideas, make decisions as a group without majoritarianism constantly reinforcing the status quo... and engage in dialogue without all conflict seen as scary.\"\n\nMany of the ways in which Edwards' perception of community have changed are rooted in an embrace for its constantly transforming qualities. After co-founding MUSE Mentorship Inc. alongside colleagues of color in 2019, the intent to provide resources for underrepresented scholars, particularly Black and Native scholars, was also an earnest effort to provide representation. Edwards and her colleagues have been able to award over $40,000 in scholarships since beginning their respective doctorate programs.\n\nWhen working with students and mentees, Edwards always approaches her work at a distance. Granting those she works with the agency and ownership of their own goals helps to foster a framework for mentorship that decenters the mentor, and effectively begins to deconstruct many of the same expectations for hierarchy present throughout academia.\n\n\"...In academia it feels like a very extractive and exploitative process,\" Edwards said. \"...Even though I'm learning from the student, they're learning from me, and we're... constantly doing this exchange -- back and forth of information and ideas. The focus is on their career goals and their trajectory.\"\n\nEdwards believes in relationship-based learning that positions mentors and mentees on equal ground to employ strategies of co-creation. Where Edwards is transparent with her own shortcomings, she finds strength and greater purpose knowing that she does not have all the answers, and that knowledge is best shared through application -- and failure.\n\n\"...It's not about me making [mentees] a copy-cutter image of me,\" Edwards said. \"It's being your own person and making sure that you're happy and fulfilled and that we can co-create this sort of process together.\"\n\nOne of the most important mediums for effective mentorship is conversation. Working through complex ideas, Edwards says, takes time. But being collaborative with others also \"struggling with these ideas and concepts\" helps situate academic concepts within greater themes of social justice.\n\nEdwards' own experiences with racism, classism, colorism and gendered violence are deeply impactful indicators of personal hardship for which she knows are often shared across the experiences of her minority colleagues.\n\n\"I see my job as like 'how can I utilize my privilege and resources and power?'\" Edwards said. \"In a way that we can both kind of help you, [the mentee] have the best outcome possible.\"\n\nEdwards maintains agency over her story, but also recognizes the importance of constantly pushing boundaries, and pushing to amplify voices who come from similar backgrounds.\n\n\"Community has been something that hasn't always been the most stable to me,\" Edwards said. \"Especially as somebody who's biracial, I am Black, and that's how I'm usually racially perceived but I also have that other part of my identity that also informs so much of my privilege and the way that I move through spaces.\"\n\nUltimately, Edwards looks to keep her post-graduation options open as she defines new notions of community and pathways to explore the depths of her interests. While she considers potential research on whales as a model of hypoxia, and the translational benefits to human health, she is eager to continue learning and growing alongside scholars of diverse backgrounds.\n\n\"I also love that no matter what this university and these systems try to take from us, we will always have our capacity to dream of something different,\" Edwards said.", "source": {"uri": "dailycollegian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Massachusetts Daily Collegian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "catharine_li@dailycollegian.com", "name": "Catharine Li", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_expression", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene expression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neuroscience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aromatase_inhibitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aromatase inhibitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RNA-Seq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letrozole", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Letrozole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_signaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cell signaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Massachusetts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cytochrome P450"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscientist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neuroscientist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intersectionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marmoset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marmoset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enzyme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fellow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Appalachian State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ridge_Parkway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blue Ridge Parkway"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science", "label": "dmoz/Science", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Psychology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Psychology", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Neurobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Neurobiology", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://dailycollegian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Picture1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

His authoritative performance has compared him to a young Michael Jordan, and many have wondered about the inspirations in Ant-Man's life.\n\nOn the eve of game 3, the Timberwolves guard was asked such a question and a specific opponent came into the conversation. When a curious reporter asked him if Jamal Murray was the one he tracked, Edwards was quick to shut down the suggestion. \"Hell nah. What is he 27? I'm finna turn 23, dog. [Kevin Durant] is 36 or 35,\" said a confident Anthony Edwards.\n\nGiven the age difference between the two, it was quite obvious to begin with, but the 22-year-old's brutal dismissal of Murray only drew parallel with their on-court match-up which the Timberwolves ace had thoroughly dominated.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves have a 2-0 lead in the Western Conference semifinals and Anthony Edwards has been one of the key pioneers of their success so far.\n\nHis 43 in game 1 and 27 points in game 2 were the catalysts in the lead, but his defensive work is not something to sleep on. Edwards gave Jamal Murray a nightmare of a series so far, locking him out to a scoreless first half in game one. Game 2 was no different for the Canadian guard as he recorded a measly 16.7% shooting with only 8 points to show for.\n\nThe thorough mauling seemingly took a toll on Murray when he was at the center of controversies in the second game. His heat pack and towel throws earned him a $100K fine from the NBA, which only compounds his hapless series so far.\n\nOn Friday, the two teams will meet again at the Target Center and, given Anthony Edwards' form, the series could easily get to an unsalvageable position for the Nuggets.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FotoJet-31-e1715240445590-1024x563.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

The Warriors could have potentially gotten their hands on Anthony Edwards, but they reportedly had some major concerns regarding him.\n\n\"Teams are worried about Edwards' drive and enthusiasm for winning, and according to a source, the Golden State Warriors aren't a likely landing spot due to these concerns,\" Bleacher Report's Jonathan Wasserman wrote.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves were the ones who held the first pick of the draft that year and they ended up selecting Edwards. As per NBA insider Brian Windhorst, though, the Timberwolves repeatedly tried to swap picks with the Warriors, but they were not interested.\n\n\"To go back to draft night -- the Wolves were very interested in trading out of this pick,\" Windhorst said. \"They were trying up until they were on the clock, from what I have been told, to get the Warriors interested in moving up.\"\n\nAs per reports from back then, the Warriors only wanted James Wiseman and knew the Timberwolves wouldn't pick him, as they already had Karl-Anthony Towns. So, they didn't feel the need to go up a spot, as they had no interest in Edwards and were sure Wiseman was going to fall in their lap anyway, which is what happened.\n\nLooking back at that situation, it was obviously a complete disaster for Golden State. It's easy to mock the Warriors considering what we know now, but Edwards was by no means seen as a can't-miss prospect back then.\n\nThere were some doubts about just how great of a player he could be and when you add in questions about professionalism and whatnot, you do get why they would have been a bit hesitant. Fast forward to the present, though, and Edwards' drive and enthusiasm for winning are things no one questions.\n\nThe 22-year-old has grown so much as a player during his short time in the league and during these playoffs, Edwards said he wanted to kill everything in front of him. It is exactly what he has been doing thus far.\n\nEdwards helped the Timberwolves sweep the Phoenix Suns in the first round and then delivered a masterpiece in Game 1 against the Denver Nuggets to steal home-court advantage. The two-time All-Star is now averaging 33.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 1.8 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game in this postseason.\n\nAs for Wiseman and the Warriors, they split in 2023 as he was traded to the Detroit Pistons. The big man never lived up to expectations in Golden State and has gone down as one of the biggest busts in recent NBA history. Fumbling that great opportunity with the second pick hurt the Warriors greatly as well, as their dynasty seems to have ended now.\n\nRelated: Anthony Edwards Says Steve Kerr Made Him A 'Madman In The Gym'\n\nThe Timberwolves Famously Passed On Stephen Curry Twice In 2009\n\nWhat makes the Warriors' decision back in 2020 so interesting is the parallels you can somewhat draw from what the Timberwolves did in 2009. Minnesota had the fifth and sixth picks in the draft that year and could have selected Stephen Curry.\n\nInstead, they chose two other point guards over him, Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn. The Warriors then drafted Curry with the seventh pick and the rest is history.\n\nWill Edwards make the Warriors regret their decision to the same extent that the Timberwolves regretted passing on Curry? Well, only time will tell, but Edwards will have to win an awful lot for that.\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

After taking a 2-0 lead against the reigning champions Denver Nuggets, Wolves' confident All-Star guard Anthony Edwards had no hesitation in taking desperate measures to guarantee the first championship trophy for the franchise.\n\nDuring an interview, when the 22-year-old was asked whether he would ink teammate Rudy Gobert's face on his body to ensure the glittery championship title, Edwards said, \"Yeah.\" On asking where he would get it done, the \"Ant-Man\" quickly stated, \"Probably [on] my arm or some sh*t.\"\n\nAfter being informed that he couldn't get rid of the tattoo later, Edwards replied, \"That's cool. To win a championship? Yeah.\" Gobert has been taking care of the Timberwolves' defense the entire season and earned his fourth DPOY title on Tuesday for his outstanding contribution.\n\nMeanwhile, Anthony Edwards is leading with the team's offense on his shoulder and has been a delight to watch in the post-season. His style of play and zeal have often been compared with NBA legend Michael Jordan, and Minnesota head coach Chris Finch laid his opinion on it.\n\nAnthony Edwards has shone brightly in the Timberwolves' colors, showing glimpses of prime Jordan. During an appearance on \"The Dan Patrick Show\", when Finch was asked about the comparison, the HC said \"Stylistically, [the Michael Jordan comparisons] might be [fair]. I think there's a long way to go, of course, in terms of championship level, sustainability, and all that. The confidence is there, the swagger is there...I can tell you that it's 100 percent real.\"\n\nWhile many have imitated MJ's moves, not everyone has impressed the Bulls legend. However, His Airness reportedly confirmed Edwards's similarities to his younger self.\n\nThe Wolves guard is averaging 32.3 points, 6.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists in the playoffs and will be facing the Nuggets in the third game of the semifinal series on Friday. While he will be entertaining the Target Center crowd with his on-court actions, he may show off his new tattoo if he decides to go for it.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dan_Patrick_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dan Patrick Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1783121979-scaled-e1715237219676.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The Warriors could have potentially gotten their hands on Anthony Edwards, but they reportedly had some major concerns regarding him.\n\n\"Teams are worried about Edwards' drive and enthusiasm for winning, and according to a source, the Golden State Warriors aren't a likely landing spot due to these concerns,\" Bleacher Report's Jonathan Wasserman wrote.\n\nThe Minnesota Timberwolves were the ones who held the first pick of the draft that year and they ended up selecting Edwards. As per NBA insider Brian Windhorst, though, the Timberwolves repeatedly tried to swap picks with the Warriors, but they were not interested.\n\n\"To go back to draft night -- the Wolves were very interested in trading out of this pick,\" Windhorst said. \"They were trying up until they were on the clock, from what I have been told, to get the Warriors interested in moving up.\"\n\nAs per reports from back then, the Warriors only wanted James Wiseman and knew the Timberwolves wouldn't pick him, as they already had Karl-Anthony Towns. So, they didn't feel the need to go up a spot, as they had no interest in Edwards and were sure Wiseman was going to fall in their lap anyway, which is what happened.\n\nLooking back at that situation, it was obviously a complete disaster for Golden State. It's easy to mock the Warriors considering what we know now, but Edwards was by no means seen as a can't-miss prospect back then.\n\nThere were some doubts about just how great of a player he could be and when you add in questions about professionalism and whatnot, you do get why they would have been a bit hesitant. Fast forward to the present, though, and Edwards' drive and enthusiasm for winning are things no one questions.\n\nThe 22-year-old has grown so much as a player during his short time in the league and during these playoffs, Edwards said he wanted to kill everything in front of him. It is exactly what he has been doing thus far.\n\nEdwards helped the Timberwolves sweep the Phoenix Suns in the first round and then delivered a masterpiece in Game 1 against the Denver Nuggets to steal home-court advantage. The two-time All-Star is now averaging 33.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists, 1.8 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game in this postseason.\n\nAs for Wiseman and the Warriors, they split in 2023 as he was traded to the Detroit Pistons. The big man never lived up to expectations in Golden State and has gone down as one of the biggest busts in recent NBA history. Fumbling that great opportunity with the second pick hurt the Warriors greatly as well, as their dynasty seems to have ended now.\n\nThe Timberwolves Famously Passed On Stephen Curry Twice In 2009\n\nWhat makes the Warriors' decision back in 2020 so interesting is the parallels you can somewhat draw from what the Timberwolves did in 2009. Minnesota had the fifth and sixth picks in the draft that year and could have selected Stephen Curry.\n\nInstead, they chose two other point guards over him, Ricky Rubio and Jonny Flynn. The Warriors then drafted Curry with the seventh pick and the rest is history.\n\nWill Edwards make the Warriors regret their decision to the same extent that the Timberwolves regretted passing on Curry? Well, only time will tell, but Edwards will have to win an awful lot for that.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gautam_varier@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Gautam Varier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wiseman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Wiseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Anthony_Towns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Anthony Towns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonny_Flynn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonny Flynn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Locks", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Fantasy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Pick_Two", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Pick Two", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjQwMDQxMjk3NTg1NTYz/441025596_1142890883504717_4483146296323701038_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Anthony Edwards finished the night with an impressive stat line of 27 points, 2 rebounds, and 7 assists, all while shooting a blistering 64% from the field.\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns also provided much-needed offensive power as he also finished with 27 points. They now head back home to Minneapolis with a series lead, ready to face off in Game 3 of the best-of-seven series this Friday.\n\nEdwards, who has already made significant strides in such a short period, shattering the 20-year playoff drought by helping the Wolves win their first series since 2004.

Anthony Edwards has suddenly become the second coming of Michael Jordan while Nikola Jokic of the Nuggets has been rendered ineffective by a tag team of Rudy Gobert and Karl-Anthony Towns, with support from rising star Naz Reid.\n\nGobert won a prestigious NBA award over Victor Wembanyama, while the Wolves' stifling defense frustrated Jamal Murray to the point of throwing a forbidden object onto the court after his team's Game 2 loss.\n\nNow, the question is how far the Timberwolves can go in the 2024 NBA Playoffs. The Wolves may not become the betting favorite to win it all any time soon, but they have the recipe for a championship if Edwards and his teammates continue to play to their fullest potential.\n\nHere are three reasons why the Timberwolves should be the new NBA title favorites:\n\n1. Anthony Edwards: Future GOAT?\n\nThe Timberwolves have had some great players in town over the course of their young franchise's illustrious history, led by franchise all-time leading scorer Kevin Garnett. Karl-Anthony Towns, Stephon Marbury and Terrell Brandon.\n\nEdwards could surpass them all by the time this year's playoff season is over and done with in Minnesota. So far, he's third in the playoffs in scoring behind former regular season MVP Joel Embiid and Big Apple media darling Jalen Brunson of the New York Knicks.\n\nEdwards' 54.7% shooting percentage is surpassed only by Anthony Davis and LeBron James in these playoffs, two physically larger players, a stat virtually unheard of as a shooting guard and just part of the reason for the Jordan comparisons.\n\nEdwards is already one of the top players in the NBA. If he can knock off Jokic and the Nuggets, a Western Conference matchup with Luka Doncic or Shai Gilgeous-Alexander could further demonstrate his status as the unofficial best player in the game at the ripe, shockingly young age of 22.\n\n2. Frontcourt Strength in Numbers-\n\nThe Timberwolves have quietly put together what could be the deepest and most versatile frontcourt rotation in the National Basketball Association.\n\nTowns is a great scorer and a dangerous shooter who can pull opposing big men away from the basket with ease. He is also quick enough to defend power forwards allowing him to play alongside either Naz Reid or Rudy Gobert, two defensive aces in the paint.\n\nModern NBA big men might not have the power and strength of guys from the past like Patrick Ewing, Shaquille O'Neal and Karl Malone, but there is more versatility in today's NBA frontcourts than perhaps at any time in NBA history. The variable skills of Towns, Gobert and Reid give Coach Chris Finch the ability to mix and match his lineups with ease, allowing the Timberwolves to play aggressive on defense with guys like Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Edwards and Jaden McDaniels picking up the opposition from the backcourt onward.\n\n3. Defense Wins Championships-\n\nTo the layman NBA fan, the Timberwolves have Anthony Edwards, Towns, and not a whole lot else compared to teams with multiple high octane scorers like the Dallas Mavericks and Boston Celtics.\n\nWhat these fans don't realize is that defense wins championships, or at least used to before Stephen Curry and Jokic began stuffing the stat sheet with outlandish three point shots, assists and rebounds totals.\n\nThe Timberwolves are currently fourth in the NBA in defensive stats in terms of points given up, but to the experienced NBA fan, it's easy to see that the T'Wolves are just now warming up. They put the screws to Murray, Jokic and the Nuggets, dismantling their offensive attack with a Trojan horse style of defense that infiltrated Coach Malone's way of attacking and put players like Michael Porter Jr. in precarious spots all game.\n\nPorter Jr.'s ineptitude attempting to put the ball on the deck versus a swarming pack of Timberwolves defenders showed just how bad Malone's team was outfoxed on Monday night.\n\nMinnesota may not have the best defensive at this point statistically in the NBA, but make no mistake about it: they have the most defensive potential of any team, a prediction Gobert made prior to the season that appears to be coming true in due time for a team that should be considered the favorites to win it all at this stage of the playoffs.\n\nWe will see if the Wolves have the chops to put away the Nuggets this coming weekend, in the meantime, it's time to give credit where credit is due and Finch's team deserves their flowers for an incredible start to what could be a transformative playoff series win in the West.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_meyer@clutchpoints.com",

The two-time All-Star didn't hesitate to concur, boldly choosing his arm as the most likely spot for the hypothetical tattoo.\n\n\"Yeah, Yeah,\" Edwards said. \"Probably [on] my arm or some sh*t.\"\n\nWhen told that he couldn't remove the tattoo afterward, Edwards wholesomely appeared unfazed.\n\n\"That's cool.

Yeah,\" Edwards said.\n\nGobert missed Monday's 106-80 blowout Game 2 second-round road win over the defending champion Denver Nuggets due to the birth of his first child.\n\nHowever, the three-time All-Star played a key role in Minnesota's No. 1-ranked regular-season defense (108.4 defensive rating). He secured his record-tying fourth Defensive Player of the Year award on Tuesday.\n\nGobert has also helped the Wolves maintain their defensive dominance in the postseason, as they boast a fourth-ranked 105.5 defensive rating through six games. Meanwhile, they are leading the playoffs in offensive rating (120.8) behind Edwards' team-best 32.3 points per game.\n\nMinnesota's hot start has made it the betting favorite to win the Western Conference (-115), per FanDuel.

As the Timberwolves advanced to Round 2, Edwards lit up the Nuggets with a 43-point explosion, including fadeaways and dunks that reminded fans of the great MJ once again.\n\nBut while the Jordan comps are everywhere for Anthony, Indiana Pacers Hall of Famer Reggie Miller isn't about to crown Edwards as the next Michael.\n\n\"There's that similarity with MJ, but I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and say he's the next Jordan because we tried to do that with Kobe, and Kobe was probably the closest thing,\" said Miller on the 'Dan Patrick Show.'\n\nFascination with finding the next Jordan\n\nAccording to Reggie, people are fascinated with trying to find the next MJ. Once a special kid arrives and his game resembles Mike's, they always end up comparing him to the Bulls legend. In the past, there was Kobe and Vince Carter. Right now, that kid is Ant.\n\nTo Edwards' credit, Reggie pointed out several correlations between his game and MJ's. Miller mentioned the movement, the shots, the fadeaways, and how Ant-Man approaches the defensive end of the court. But while there are plenty of similarities, Uncle Reg says that Anthony is more like another all-time great shooting guard than Jordan.\n\n\"I would say he is more like Dwyane Wade with a jump shot because he's not as tall as Mike. Mike was about 6'5\", 6'6\", Anthony Edwards is about 6'4\" but he is more in the Flash category but with a better jump shot,\" added Miller.\n\nAnt is in the Flash Category\n\nLooking closely at Miller's comparison, Ant-Man and D-Wade do have some striking similarities. Both are listed at 6'4'' and have the same body type. Both also have explosive athleticism, which allows them to attack the basket effectively. With their stocky frames, they can also finish with contact.\n\nHowever, as Miller pointed out, the 22-year-old Edwards has the jump shot that Wade had to develop throughout his career. Ant has consistently shown that during the current postseason, hitting mid-range jumpers and fadeaways almost at will against both the Suns and Nuggets.\n\nWhether he resembles MJ or D-Wade more, the Timberwolves could care less as long as Edwards is dominating the game. Anthony averaged 31.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game against Phoenix.\n\nHe has now recorded 35.0 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.0 blocks, and 1.5 steals per contest through the first two games against the Nuggets, as Minnesota has taken a 2-0 lead over the defending champions. If he prolongs this run, Ant could really make his name even bigger than it is right now.\n\nRelated: \"Ant hit the Jordan shrug\" - Internet reacts to Minnesota whooping the Nuggets", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shane_garry_acedera@postandcourier.com", "name": "Shane Garry Acedera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Miller", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Miller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Lang_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jump_shot_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jump shot (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Patrick_(sportscaster)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Patrick (sportscaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vince Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/4d/44df7b6a-18c0-5c9a-904a-c1328153c5e2/663a4e46a5020.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

There's always someone bigger, stronger, and faster on the horizon. Not too long ago LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Kevin Durant dominated. Now, they're all gone from the NBA Playoffs, replaced by fresh young faces.\n\nThe NBA is changing, and it's for the better.\n\nLeBron, Steph, and KD are trailblazers, but their end is near. This is the first time since 2005 that none reached the second round of the playoffs. There are only six starters left who are over 30 years old. The youth have taken over.\n\nA new crop of stars has emerged to carry the league into the future. Leading the way is Minnesota's brash and electric Anthony Edwards. The 22-year-old is a walking highlight who has been so impressive that comparisons to Michael Jordan don't seem like hyperbole. The Oklahoma City Thunder is the youngest team to earn a No. 1 seed and have MVP finalist Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, 26, a sophomore in 22-year-old Jalen Williams, and Rookie of the Year runner-up Chet Holmgren who just turned 21 this month. The Indiana Pacers have Tyrese Haliburton, 24, and by the way, even veteran playoff performers like Jayson Tatum and Luka Don\u010di\u0107 are 26 and 25 respectively.\n\nHow far can youth take an NBA team? Historically, not very. Champions are usually veteran teams with veteran players. The playoffs may go according to script again this year, with the defending champion Denver Nuggets facing the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals. But given the surprising regular season, we wouldn't rule out the unexpected. No one could have predicted that Oklahoma City and Minnesota would be undefeated in the playoffs so far.\n\nIf you're NBA commissioner Adam Silver, seeing the Timberwolves or the Thunder reach the Finals would be exciting and intriguing. Edwards is the poster child for the new hope. He's been famous since he was the top high school recruit in the nation. But in college, while he was electric, his Georgia team went 16-16 in his one-season stint. And while Edwards was the No. 1 overall pick by Minnesota in 2020, for most of his young career, he hasn't had much postseason success. The most we paid attention to Edwards was his impressive acting debut in the Adam Sandler basketball movie Hustle.\n\nEdwards made a leap this season, setting career bests in several categories and emerging as a bonafide star in the playoffs. Edwards and 24-year-old Naz Reid, the NBA's Rookie of the Year, have put the league on notice. If Minnesota upsets the Nuggets and reaches the Western Conference Finals, you could make the argument that Edwards is already the third-best player in franchise history behind Kevin Garnett and Kevin Love.\n\nAs impressive as Minnesota has been with its stifling defense, Oklahoma City has been the most consistent force in the West. What makes it more surprising is that its starting lineup has an average age of 23.2. The Thunder are the envy of every front office. Their best player, Gilgeous-Alexander, is entering his prime, and Williams and Holmgren still have plenty of room to grow. This is the best young core the team has had since Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and James Harden powered them to the 2012 NBA Finals.\n\nAre Minnesota and Oklahoma City too young to win it all? Don't tell them. Just enjoy this new edition of upcoming stars. The league needs the next generation to shine.", "source": {"uri": "thecomeback.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Comeback"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_grant@thecomeback.com", "name": "Michael Grant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chet_Holmgren", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chet Holmgren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shai_Gilgeous-Alexander", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shai Gilgeous-Alexander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Love", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Garnett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Garnett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Sandler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Sandler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SYLED.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

After executing a remarkable layup, Edwards exchanged a stare with Nuggets guard Reggie Jackson, resulting in a technical foul.\n\nThe decision drew widespread criticism, with NBA legends Charles Barkley and Reggie Miller questioning the officials' judgment.\n\nBarkley expressed his disbelief, asserting, \"Nobody came to see your a*s play. Stop giving taunting technicals... Nobody came to see you.\" Miller echoed similar sentiments, emphasizing the heightened emotions of playoff basketball and the need for officiating leniency.\n\nDespite the controversy, Edwards remained composed, etching his name alongside NBA icon Kobe Bryant in the record books. His back-to-back 40-plus point performances at the age of 22 or younger mirrored Bryant's historic achievement in the 2001 playoffs.\n\nEdwards' stellar performance included 17 made field goals, a 42.9% shooting accuracy from beyond the arc, and significant contributions in rebounds, assists, blocks, and steals. However, a controversial technical foul marred an otherwise flawless display.\n\nAs the Timberwolves prepare for Game 2 of the series, fans eagerly anticipate an intense matchup, hoping for improved officiating standards.

George was one of the first to say that Edwards may be the face of the league sooner than people think.\n\n\"Anthony Edwards [is] going to have his time [getting old], so be careful what you wish for,\" George said. \"I heard him say he'll be the face of the league in about two, three years. I think maybe less than that. I just love his approach. I love his tenacity. He's challenging the peers at his age now and he's going at the veterans that spend 10 plus years in the game. So I love that.\"\n\nSeeing Edwards' banter to Kevin Durant during the NBA Playoffs brought a smile to George's face. To George, witnessing that moment was like witnessing a passing of the torch in real-time.\n\n\"I wish we could have heard that banter between those two. I love that moment of KD laughing it off because AE actually said KD was his GOAT. And so I'm sure for him that was a special moment to be able to match up with him in that playoff run against the Phoenix Suns. So it was dope, man. It was dope.

The Timberwolves led by double digits for most of the game and Anthony Edwards was asked if he was surprised that the Nuggets didn't throw the first punch and also if he felt they were losing confidence.\n\n\"Nah, not at all. It worked in our favor tonight, man, that's all that was,\" Edwards said. \"We made shots, they didn't. That's the defending champs over there. They're not gonna come out and play like that again in Game 3. We gotta be ready to take their punch.\n\n\"And I always tell the team when we huddle up, and (Chris Finch) say, 'We gotta be ready to take they punch', I say, 'We gonna punch too'. S***, they not the only one punching in the fight,\" Edwards continued. \"So I mean, yeah, just like that. They not the only one that is gonna coming out punching.\n\n\"I don't give a damn if we go up 3-0,\" Edwards stated. \"For Game 4 we gonna come out punching, too. So they gotta be ready to take our punch and we will be ready to take their punch. I don't see no slippage in their games. They just missed shots tonight. They'll be ready to go (in) Game 3 and we will be.\"\n\n(starts at 8:38 mark):\n\nThat is certainly the mindset you want your team's star player to have, as it then spreads to the rest of the team as well. Edwards knows the Nuggets are not going to throw in the towel and the message is clear, be prepared for the punches and fire back.\n\nIn Game 2, though, the Timberwolves were the only ones throwing punches. They led by as many as 32 points at one stage and completely outclassed the defending champions. Edwards did his part in that dismantling, as he recorded 27 points, 2 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2 steals on the night. Just like the Phoenix Suns in the first round, the Nuggets have not found a way to slow down the 22-year-old.\n\nAnthony Edwards Praised Jaden McDaniels\n\nEdwards also had some special praise for his teammate Jaden McDaniels during his press conference. When talking about the team's approach in Game 2, the two-time All-Star felt McDaniels deserved to get a shoutout. (starts at 2:42 mark in the above video):\n\n\"But I do just want to just shoutout Jaden McDaniels before I get out of here,\" Edwards said. \"He's been phenomenal this whole playoff run and this series in particular. I think he's like a +51 or something and only probably had 5 points, took 3 shots in all two games, and don't complain, keep guarding, keep picking up full court.\n\n\"And we wouldn't be the team that we are today, we wouldn't have been the team that we was in the regular season,\" Edwards continued. \"Hopefully we can keep him out there and he keeps playing like that because he's definitely the x-factor of the team. Everything that he brings, we thank him so much. So big shoutout to Jaden, for sure.\"\n\nMcDaniels has given the Nuggets plenty of headaches in this series with his tough defense.

With stakes at their highest, players want to acquire every edge. Take an inch and turn it into a mile. And for Draymond Green, that means getting inside the heads of his opponents.\n\nAccording to the former Defensive Player of the Year winner, Minnesota Timberwolves superstar Anthony Edwards is one player showing a lot of savvy this postseason.\n\nAt just 22 years old, Edwards already displays a level of gamesmanship that belies his age. He's been quick to credit the Denver Nuggets, particularly Nikola Jokic, whom he's dubbed the best player in the world. But Draymond, one of the NBA's most brilliant minds, suspects there's more to Edwards' words than meets the eye. He believes that Edwards, deep down, truly sees himself as the best in the business, not Jokic.\n\nPlaying mind games\n\nSpeaking on the latest episode of \"The Draymond Green Show,\" the Golden State Warriors forward shared his observations of the explosive 6-foot-4 wingman. While Edwards's supreme athleticism is evident, what lies beneath is a fire stoked by his innate desire to be the best.\n\n\"He's hungry as hell, and he believes that he's the best, and he wants to be the best,\" Dray shared. \"He knows how to play the game. I mean, to play the game, this dude going up in these press conferences during this series, like, 'You know, Joker's the best player in the world.' And he thinks he's the best player in the world. I ain't hearing none of that.\"\n\nEdwards is a playful guy who likes to go back and forth with opponents willing to banter. But so far, he has let his play do all the talking, averaging 35.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 1.5 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game to push the Timberwolves to a commanding 2-0 lead over the reigning NBA champions.\n\nBacking his belief up\n\nAs talented and skilled as Ant is, Draymond says his unwavering self-belief ultimately propels him to success. Whether his shot is on target or not, he never loses focus and looks for the next opportunity to influence his team's chances of winning.\n\n\"He 100% believes that he's the best player in the world. And if you don't believe he 100% believes that he's the best player in the world, all you got to do is watch him play. He's playing like he believes he's the best player in the world,\" the Dubs' versatile forward remarked.\n\nGreen added that what's captivating is that Ant has been prophesying about his future impact on the league for a while now. It wasn't long ago that Edwards proclaimed he would dominate the league in two to three years and that he had only tapped into 40 percent of his potential.\n\n\"While all along, all this year, he's told y'all what he thinks of himself since he came into the league. He's been telling so, it is very evident that he believes that,\" the fiery and controversial power forward quipped.\n\nThe Ant-Man takeover is in full effect. While Minnesota is up 2-0 on the Nuggets, the defending champions won't likely go out without a proper fight. And chances are, it will be up to Edwards whether the T-Wolves' magical march through this season continues or ends.\n\nRelated: \"Hope he doesn't show up\" - George Karl says the most difficult opponent to prepare for wasn't Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonas_panerio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jonas Panerio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Karl", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Karl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/5/de/5de57e09-9cac-52d2-a6a1-0886dc152dd2/663b3575cae87.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

One superstar who seems to be in awe of Ant Edwards is the Atlanta Hawks star, Trae Young. Just two days ago, Trae Young took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice his opinion about Edwards' 43-point performance against the Nuggets. He wrote, \"Ant Man in that Zone!!\" Edwards followed his impressive Game 1 performance, with another stellar showing. He scored 27 points and dished out 7 dimes, as the T-Wolves won by a scoreline of 106-80.\n\nFollowing this impressive display, the X account of Everything Georgia dropped a congratulatory post, with captions, \"The whole state of Georgia is rooting for Ant-Man to win it all.\" However, what caught most fans' attention was Trae Young's comments under the post. Young wrote, \"Should've been a Hawk to start, but that's for another day.\"\n\nTrae Young's remarks about Anthony Edwards and his association with the Hawks organization have caught many by surprise.", "source": {"uri": "todayheadline.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "TodayHeadline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trae Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historians", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historians", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/todayheadline.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-13T011243Z_1903535697_MT1USATODAY23010521_RTRMADP_3_NBA-ATLANTA-HAWKS-AT-MINNESOTA-TIMBERWOLVES-473x315.jpg?ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

He emphasized that such incidents shouldn't occur in the playoffs:\n\n\"Oh, come on, man!...

He was never viewed as that, especially when I got here. I always thought he was a great defensive player. He just had to put his mind to it.\"\n\nEdwards made it clear that Chris Finch's defensive influence on the team has impacted every player, with the team especially motivating Towns to be a major defensive contributor.\n\n\"When Finchy got here, man, Finchy put emphasis on, 'Hey, Ant and KAT, if we wanna go somewhere, we gotta defend'. And like he said, that's the head of the snake. And hearing that from him, it pushed KAT. And I tell KAT, we need you to defend. Corliss tells KAT, we need you to defend. The whole team. And ever since he's been back, this whole year, man, since he's been at the 4, he's been defending his ass off.\"\n\nKarl-Anthony Towns has been one of the most talented players in the NBA since being drafted in 2015 but has been regarded as one of the worst big man defenders in recent memory. He's shattered that reputation by holding his own defensively as the Wolves look like one of the greatest modern defenses in NBA history.\n\nMinnesota ended the regular season with a defensive rating of 109.0, a mark that's 2.3 points better than any other team in the NBA. For context, teams that finished two through nine on the defensive rating rankings are separated by 2.1 points.\n\nIf Towns was still as bad a defender as people claim, the Wolves wouldn't be so much better than every other team when it comes to defense. He's averaging 20.7 points and 9.0 rebounds this playoff run, returning from a torn meniscus a week before the playoffs and continuing to excel while on the court as a secondary option behind Edwards.\n\nAnthony Edwards Will Not Underestimate Denver Heading Into Game 3\n\nAnthony Edwards is ready to face the challenge the Nuggets will pose in Game 3, not underestimating his opposition and stressing the importance of his team needing to be ready to handle whatever Denver throws at them as well as throwing punches of their own.\n\n\"That's the defending champs over there. They're not gonna come out and play like that again in Game 3. We gotta be ready to take their punch. I always tell the team when we huddle up, and (Chris Finch) say, 'We gotta be ready to take they punch', I say, 'We gonna punch too'. S***, they not the only one punching in the fight.\"\n\nEdwards made it clear his mentality will stay the same even if the Wolves win Game 3 and have a chance to sweep Denver.\n\n\"I don't give a damn if we go up 3-0. For Game 4 we gonna come out punching, too. So they gotta be ready to take our punch and we will be ready to take their punch. I don't see any slippage in their games. They just missed shots tonight.

His teammates look at him as the team's superstar and he has delivered so far in the Playoffs.\n\nEdwards is averaging 32.3 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 5.8 assists through the five wins the Wolves have enjoyed so far.

He's averaging 32.3 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 5.8 assists through the six consecutive wins the Wolves have rattled off to open the 2024 Playoffs.\n\nEdwards and the Wolves are on the verge of eliminating the biggest threat in the West as they lead the Denver Nuggets 2-0 after the first two games in Denver. The home team has only made four successful comebacks from a 0-2 deficit in NBA history, so the pressure is on the Wolves to see this series win through as Games 3 and 4 will be played in Minnesota.\n\nAnthony Edwards Coming Into Game 3 With An Aggressive Mentality\n\nEdwards is ready to take full control of this series with a 3-0 lead, something that no team in NBA history has successfully overturned. The Wolves know they're on the precipice of the second Conference Finals appearance in franchise history and won't let the moment slip.\n\nEdwards is well aware of how dangerous the Nuggets can be and made it clear that the Wolves aren't taking them lightly despite the lead.\n\n\"They're not gonna come out and play like that again in Game 3. We gotta be ready to take their punch. And I always tell the team when we huddle up, and (Chris Finch) say, 'We gotta be ready to take they punch', I say, 'We gonna punch too'. Sh*t, they not the only one punching in the fight. So I mean, yeah, just like that. They not the only one that is gonna coming out punching.\"\n\nEdwards made it clear that even a Game 3 win won't be enough for the Wolves to take their foot off the gas.\n\n\"I don't give a damn if we go up 3-0. For Game 4 we gonna come out punching, too. So they gotta be ready to take our punch and we will be ready to take their punch. I don't see no slippage in their games. They just missed shots tonight. They'll be ready to go (in) Game 3 and we will be.\"\n\nIf the Wolves advance past the Nuggets, they would be serious contenders for the title. They'd likely be favored over the Mavericks or Thunder depending on who makes it to the Conference Finals.

Durant was a rookie that year and his Thunder team didn't make the playoffs, while Curry was not yet in the NBA.\n\nIt is the first time none of the trio have reached the second round of the playoffs since 2005, the year before James made the first playoff trip of his career.\n\nJames, Durant and Curry have provided countless iconic moments in the post-season for the best part of two decades, but the next generation is well and truly ready to take centre stage.\n\nDurant's Phoenix Suns were ousted by the Minnesota Timberwolves, and there was a real sense of a torch being passed between the two-time Finals MVP and Wolves superstar Anthony Edwards during the four-game sweep.\n\nEdwards, the number one pick in the 2020 draft, has all the tools to be the next face of the NBA after the James-Durant-Curry era comes to an end.\n\nHe is charismatic off the court in a way that makes every one of his press conferences must-watch TV. At just 22, he is already the undisputed leader of his team, and he is as explosive an athlete the league has seen perhaps since a young Michael Jordan in the 1980s.\n\nIt's almost sacrilegious to compare anyone to Jordan, who is still considered by many to be the greatest player of all time, but with Edwards the comparisons are undeniable.\n\nEvery time he steps on the court, regardless of who the opponent is, Edwards believes he is the best player. He has the Jordan-like ability to drag the best out of his teammates, and has the jaw-dropping plays that make him jump off the TV screen.\n\nEdwards is marketable in the same way that made Jordan instantly one of the most recognisable athletes on the planet as the NBA really took off into a different stratosphere throughout the 90s.\n\nJames's accolades led to him being compared to Jordan the most, but the truth is their playing styles are completely different. In terms of simply looking like Jordan did on the court, the only player in the last 30 years who has been more Jordanesque than Edwards is the late Kobe Bryant.\n\nIt's hard to believe that the Wolves came into this series as underdogs, but if there were any nerves early, Edwards's play helped them dissipate immediately as he went toe to toe with Durant, a player he idolised when growing up.\n\nEdwards finished the series averaging 31 points, eight rebounds and 6.3 assists per game and closed out Game 4 and Durant's season by dunking on his head with the game on the line.\n\nJordan famously told future Hall-of-Famers Magic Johnson and Larry Bird that there was a \"new sheriff in town\" during the 1992 Olympics when the trio suited up on the US Dream Team.\n\nEdwards will be flanked by Durant, James and Curry in Paris this year. Don't be surprised if he tells the old heads something similar.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder had a right to feel a little slighted coming into the NBA playoffs.\n\nDespite securing the number one seed in the Western Conference after winning 57 games -- second only to the 64-win Boston Celtics in the east -- the Thunder were talked about like they would be a speed bump for most teams in the first round.\n\nWhen the Lakers finished the season in seventh spot, there was a train of thought that they should tank one of the play-in games before winning the second in order to face the Thunder instead of the reigning champion Denver Nuggets.\n\nThere was a similar confidence among those who believed in the 10th-seeded Golden State Warriors, who thought they could easily account for the inexperienced Thunder.\n\nThe result? The Warriors didn't even make the playoffs, while the Lakers were bundled out in five games by the Nuggets, and the Thunder swept their first-round series against the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nAs expected, there were some playoff jitters for the Thunder, who came into the season as the second-youngest team in the entire NBA ahead of the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs won 22 games this season for comparison's sake.\n\nOKC looked like it would lose the series opener at home to the Pelicans before their nerveless superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander carried them home with 28 points, six rebounds and four assists.\n\nFrom there, the Thunder went from strength to strength, and the results have to be terrifying for the rest of the league.\n\nThe biggest reason inexperienced teams often flounder in the post-season is a lack of belief, but this Thunder team has that in spades, led by Gilgeous-Alexander himself.\n\nWhile the Canadian guard set the tone, as the series wore on, he saw his younger counterparts all come to the fore at different points in the series.\n\nJalen Williams, who is likely to be an All-Star forward for years to come, finished the series averaging 21.3 points, 7.3 rebounds and five assists per contest. His all-round reliable game takes the load off Gilgeous-Alexander and doesn't allow defences to key in on the Canadian guard.\n\nYoung big man Chet Holmgren certainly looked frazzled in the series opener, but still finished with five blocks before responding to that win with a 26-point, seven rebound effort in Game 2.\n\nThat brings us to Giddey. The Aussie was unsighted in Game 1, making just one basket in OKC's 94-92 win, but his finish to the series showed just how important he is to making the Thunder truly unguardable.\n\nOKC's starting line-up of Giddey, Holmgren, Gilgeous-Alexander, Williams and Lu Dort outscored the Pelicans by 29.5 points per 100 possessions, and the Aussie's ability to constantly knock down outside shots unlocked that five-man unit.\n\nAfter a slow start to the series, Giddey exploded in Games 3 and 4, knocking down eight triples on just 13 attempts from deep, including three in the final quarter of Game 4 to close out the Pelicans.\n\nA common train of thought has been that the Thunder are a piece away or a year away. But if they keep up this play in the next round against Dallas, they'll soon wonder, 'Why not this year?'.\n\nIs the 'Big Three' era of the NBA over? It certainly seems like it.\n\nThe basketball landscape shifted in 2010 when the Miami Heat managed to lure both LeBron James and Chris Bosh to join Dwyane Wade in South Beach.\n\nJames's titanic free agency call ushered in an arms race across the league as teams attempted to follow the model set out by the Heat -- three All-NBA level players flanked by ring-hunting veterans and cheap young players on minimum contracts.\n\nIt's a model that has yielded championships for James -- in both Miami and Cleveland -- and several other franchises over the last decade, but recently there's been a shift.\n\nDepth has become a key factor in this post-season and the teams with the best chance of winning the title have all been able to call on their benches in key moments to help lift them through games.\n\nJames won his fourth title on a Lakers team that was built around he and All-Star big man Anthony Davis, with the pair flanked by solid role players such as Alex Caruso, Kyle Kuzma, Danny Green and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.\n\nJust 12 months later, the Lakers punted on their depth in search of a third star with an ill-fated move to acquire Russell Westbrook in a deal that effectively cost them Caldwell-Pope and Kuzma as well as Caruso, who signed with the Chicago Bulls as a free agent that summer.\n\nThe Lakers have been playing catch-up ever since that trade in order to find pieces that fit as well around their star duo, and Caldwell-Pope has become a vital part of the Denver Nuggets team that is threatening to go back-to-back.\n\nWhen Phoenix went to the finals in 2021, it was on the back of a deep team that was stacked with elite role players who supplemented All-Stars Chris Paul and Devin Booker.\n\nSince then, the Suns traded their depth for starpower, first adding Kevin Durant, before trading for Bradley Beal last summer.\n\nThe Suns found out first-hand just how important depth can be after their bench was outscored by Minnesota's in a first-round sweep.\n\nThis is not to say every team with three or more All-Star calibre players is doomed from the tip-off. The Timberwolves, who have flanked Anthony Edwards and Karl Anthony-Towns with Rudy Gobert to great effect, are one example. The league-leading Boston Celtics were an outside chance of having four All-Stars this season.\n\nHowever, both teams have multiple homegrown All-Stars in Edwards and Towns, and Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown, which makes a GM's task of team-building that much easier. The Nuggets have a similar model after drafting Nikola Jokic, Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr.\n\nThe lesson here is simple -- stacking talent is still a viable route to winning a championship, as long as you're not gutting your roster to do so.\n\nThe saddest theme to come out of the first round was the number of stars either not playing at all or playing hobbled.\n\nMilwaukee was thought of as the most likely team to give Boston a run for its money in the East, yet was bounced out in the first round by Indiana, with Giannis Antetokounmpo not seeing the floor for a single minute due to a calf injury, while star off-season recruit Damian Lillard was hobbled with an Achilles issue.\n\nPhiladelphia was also bounced out in the first round and was once again forced to deal with Joel Embiid being nowhere near 100 per cent healthy.\n\nThe Pelicans cruelly saw peak Zion Williamson in the first play-in game against the Lakers, only for the 2019 number one pick to be forced out of the game (and eventually the rest of the post-season) with three minutes left.\n\nThis brings us to the curious case of Kawhi Leonard and the LA Clippers.\n\nLeonard joined the Clippers in the summer of 2019 on the back of winning the second title and second Finals MVP of his career in a stellar season with the Toronto Raptors.\n\nHe was magical in that playoff run, which ended with the Raptors beating the Warriors in six games and appeared to be well past the injuries that ruined his final season in San Antonio.\n\nLeonard was heavily courted before settling on the Clippers. There was a school of thought at the time suggesting he had become the best player in the entire league.\n\nThe Clippers traded a host of picks as well as Gilgeous-Alexander to the Thunder for Paul George in the hopes of pairing him with Leonard to bring the team its first NBA title. In a cruel twist of fate, just five years on from that deal, Gilgeous-Alexander and the Thunder appear far closer to a title than the Clippers are.\n\nSince joining the Clippers, Leonard has ended the post-season healthy on exactly one occasion -- in 2020 when he saw his team blow a 3-1 lead to a young Nuggets team in the second round.\n\nLeonard was playing the best basketball of his career in the 2021 playoffs before suffering a partial ACL tear that not only ended his post-season, but ruled him out of the following season.\n\nLast year, Leonard was again on fire in the first round against the Suns, only to suffer a torn meniscus in his right knee.\n\nLeonard's chequered injury history has resulted in him gaining a reputation of being unreliable, which has clouded the fact that he is still one of the 10 best players in the world ... when healthy.\n\nThis season was Leonard's last five years in a nutshell. He was excellent in the regular season and was named to the All-Star team for the sixth time in his career. He is likely to be named on one of the All-NBA teams as well. He then missed half of the Clippers' first-round series against the Mavericks.\n\nThe Clippers signed Leonard to a three-year extension in January, but have to be wondering just what his age 33-36 years will look like and whether he'll even be able to see out the end of that contract.\n\nThe New York Knicks were the laughing stock of the NBA two summers' ago when their plans of adding Donovan Mitchell went up in smoke, leaving them with Jalen Brunson as a consolation prize.\n\nUp until that point, Brunson had been a solid but unspectacular sidekick to Luka Don\u010di\u0107 in Dallas. His signing with the Knicks was the league's worst-kept secret, given his father Rick was hired as an assistant coach with the Knicks a month before Brunson signed a four-year, $104 million deal as a free agent.\n\nEven in their wildest dreams, Knicks fans would not have predicted what Brunson has turned into since landing in the Big Apple.\n\nThe pint-sized point guard has become the most beloved Knick since Patrick Ewing, and after an upset first-round win over Mitchell's Cavs in last year's playoffs, Brunson's Knicks are at it again.\n\nOn paper, the Knicks have no right to be winning these series. They are severely undermanned without All-Star forward Julius Randle, and the ball is always in Brunson's hands down the stretch of games, given there's no other solid ball-handlers capable of running an offence consistently.\n\nTeams know what's coming yet they can't stop it, a testament to Brunson's offensive wizardry.\n\nThe Knicks took care of the Sixers in the first round, the same Sixers other teams in the East willingly ducked from facing in the first round.\n\nNot many people would consider Brunson to be a better player than Sixers star Joel Embiid, but time and time again, it was Brunson closing out games down the stretch with the composure of a league MVP, not the reigning MVP himself.\n\nBrunson averaged 35.5 points and nine assists per game against Philly. Here's how he finished the last four games of that series: 39 points and 13 assists in Game 3, 47 points and 10 assists in Game 4, 40 points and six assists in Game 5, and 41 points and 12 assists in Game 6.\n\nHis Game 4 and Game 6 statlines have never been achieved by any other player in Knicks history. He joined LeBron James and Michael Jordan as just the third player to put up over 35 points and five assists in four straight playoff games.\n\nEvery time Embiid and the Sixers looked ready to overpower the Knicks, there was Brunson, hitting a contested triple or stumbling in between three defenders to drain an off-balance floater in the lane to keep New York alive.\n\nAfter they were the butt of jokes for years before his arrival, Brunson has made the Knicks relevant and respected again by being the star they've yearned to have since Carmelo Anthony's heyday a decade ago.", "source":

The former Grizzlies is in full support of Anthony Edwards and Jalen Brunson.\n\n\"1a. He's right there with Jalen Brunson,\" Carter said about Anthony Edwards.

To them, they're still not satisfied.\n\n\"You want to win every game,\" Minnesota star Anthony Edwards said. \"You don't want to split, you want to win two here and have home court advantage and try to win two at home.\"\n\nMinnesota led by as many as 32 points -- a new playoff franchise record. It did it with defense, holding Denver to 80 points, which tied for the lowest point total for the Nuggets in a playoff game in the Nikola Jokic era.\n\n\"We've had some really, really good defensive efforts this year, but that has to be right up there with the best of them,\" Minnesota coach Chris Finch said. \"Doing it over and over and over again requires mental toughness, and we had that.\"\n\nEven though Gobert couldn't make it back to Denver after the birth of his first child, his presence was more than felt in the T-Wolves locker room.\n\n\"Rudy's driven a defensive culture here,\" Finch said. \"It's a testament to his impact, his presence and what he's infused into the team. We expect to win no matter who's with us and who's not. Our guys truly believe that. We're extremely happy for him.\"\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local Savings\n\nAlthough the Game 1 win may be equally as impressive in its own way, the T-Wolves did it in Game 2 without an offensive explosion from Edwards, who had 27 points on an efficient 11-for-17 shooting from the field. He also responded to all of the double teams thrown at him with seven assists.\n\nHis only 3-pointer came midway through the fourth quarter, when he moved to his right and fired a shot up from the right wing with the shot clock winding down. As soon as the ball went in the hoop, Edwards hit a shrug that reminded some people of a similar shrug a guy named Michael Jordan did back in the day.\n\nEdwards didn't feel like he was living in the moment, he feels like the moment is living in him.\n\n\"It definitely gives me energy,\" Edwards said. \"I feel like I've always done that, no matter what stage it's on. It brings excitement to the game.\"\n\nBut that wasn't even the biggest celebration of the night for the T-Wolves.\n\nIn the final minute of the second quarter, veteran point guard Mike Conley stole the ball from Michael Porter Jr. and immediately threw the ball ahead to a wide-open Edwards, who let the ball bounce one time inside the 3-point line before picking it up and slamming it through the hoop to give his team a 28-point lead.\n\nBut before the ball even got to Edwards, Conley turned to the Minnesota bench and screamed so loud everyone in the Twin Cities could hear him.\n\n\"That moment was just a microcosm of the whole night,\" Conley said. \"We were being aggressive, we were scrappy, we were getting our hands on loose balls. I got my hand on the ball and was able to get a steal and I knew Ant was gonna dunk it. I turned around and started yelling before he even dunked it. I think the bench felt that energy, and that's just who we have to be.\"", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_king_tyler_king@gazette.com", "name": "Tyler King Tyler.King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Gobert", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rudy Gobert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ball Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Finch_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Finch (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Gazette", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montreal Gazette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Joki\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nikola Joki\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Klee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Klee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Conley_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Conley Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shot clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis\u2013Saint_Paul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slam_dunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slam dunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Porter Jr."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/88/c887ab5f-d195-586a-8dd6-bcc8a9116f08/6639ac84485ba.image.jpg?crop=1705%2C895%2C0%2C159&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

And look, and I get the argument, \"well, Tatum's already been to a finals. How many Eastern Conference finals has he gone to?\" There's a softness I see with him. He's not my favorite player on the team. There's something missing with him. Edwards is a badass.

That's a big checkmark in the Anthony Edwards category.\n\nJim Murray: That's a great point, Jimmy.\n\nJim Murray: Jimmy Butler, with some questionable tactics, tried to get Karl-Anthony towns to play hard and it didn't work. Anthony Edwards has done that.\n\nFelger: Tatum is with 6'9'' and plays like 6'11\". Or he's 6'8'', but I feel like he plays like Durant. Like I think he's got that length. So I would much rather have Tatum's size and length. Tatum's also a little bit better of a shooter, don't you think?\n\nMazz: Yeah, this kid's still learning it, but yeah.\n\nFelger: I mean, statistically, Edwards is a 35% shooter from three career. Tatum is.\n\nJ-Stew: Edwards came into the league and they weren't sure if he was going to be able to shoot the three as the number one overall draft pick. And he worked to get to 35%.\n\nMazz: That number is going to go up.\n\nFelger: So I think Tatum, and again just eyeballing it and just seeing it, I think Tatum is a more fluid athlete. He's a more coordinated athlete. I think Anthony Edwards is more raw power. More aggressive, certainly, but he's smaller. Tatum is bigger and shoots a little better.\n\nMazz: Yes. You're right. That part's right. Here's what I would tell you, I look at them and I say, Edwards is 6'4'' but plays bigger. Tatum is 6'9'' and plays a little smaller.

To name a few.\n\nIt would be a bit premature to say, with absolute certainty, that Edwards, Doncic and Gilgeous-Alexander will soon start a run for championship trophies with their teams. They might not even lift one next month. Or ever in their careers.\n\nSometimes stuff happens to spoil the conversation and wreck the crystal ball. Ask Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley and Grant Hill, among others -- all were seen as \"next\" during their prime.\n\nBut it sure feels like a page-turning here in the spring of 2024.\n\nAnd these young players are impatient and greedy, which is what a perspective champion and superstar must be. They're no longer asking James, Curry and the rest for autographs.\n\nHere's how, and why, these 25-and-under stars are announcing their attempted takeovers in these playoffs with a bullhorn:\n\nAnthony Edwards, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nBody of work: At just 22, he owns the fastest-rising reputation in the league, drawing comparisons to 2006 Dwyane Wade and even Michael Jordan (pre-six championships). The latter might be a bit rich, but such is life in a social media and debate TV era, where recency bias runs unchecked and nuance is often lost in the rush to gush.\n\nMake no mistake, though, Edwards is jumping the line and could already be a top-five pure talent in today's game. Just ask Kevin Durant, whom he swept in the first round, or any current greats. Or, just trust your eyes. Best of all, his impact lies on both ends of the floor.\n\nHis biggest improvement is shooting. As he said the other day: \"When I came into the league, the thing was, I couldn't shoot.\" Edwards' 3-point shot remains a work in progress -- he's a career 35.3% shooter and has regressed from last season. But his confidence from that distance is better and he doesn't hesitate to aim in big moments.\n\nHis scoring has increased every season, and aside from the growth in his mid-range game, his passing and trust in his teammates show improved basketball maturity.\n\nEnd of the game? Edwards wants the last shot, not caring about the blowback if he misses.\n\nFinally: Edwards is available. For the second straight season, he played 79 games. Yes, that's the advantage of being young, yet he stays in supreme shape, and having a football background doesn't hurt. Besides, while many say they love basketball, Edwards proves it.\n\nWork to do: He just took his team into the Western Conference semifinals. At least that's progress, considering he lost in the first round last season. The ultimate measure of greatness is playing well into May and even June, and doing it consistently.\n\nEdwards has never won a major award, but again, he's just getting started. He's expected to be named All-NBA this month, which could be the first of many such honors.\n\nSaid Durant: \"So impressed with Ant. My favorite player to watch ... he's gonna be somebody I'm following for the rest of his career.\"\n\nLuka Doncic, Dallas Mavericks\n\nBody of work: Initially he was on the fast track for being one of the greatest international players ever. After further review, Doncic at his current pace could rank among the greatest players -- regardless of birthplace.\n\nDoncic has few peers as a playmaker, shot-creator, passer, rebounder and floor surveyor. The ability to combine elite basketball smarts and elite basketball skills is rare -- even the best players in the league don't enjoy that balance -- and makes him a problem.\n\nHe's already made four All-NBA first teams, is a four-time All-Star starter and claimed the scoring title this season (only Euro to do so). He and LeBron James are the only players to reach 10,000 points, 3,000 rebounds and 3,000 assists before turning 25.\n\nAlso, Doncic's thirst for competition runs high. It often backfires on him -- pity the referees who work his games -- although it also fuels him in big moments and with the game up for grabs.\n\nDoncic has only taken the Mavericks to one Western Conference Finals, but he's still looking to be blessed with a long-running star teammate, which is necessary to make constant deep playoff runs. Dirk Nowitzki was too old to be Doncic's co-star during their short time together, and this is just Doncic's second season with Kyrie Irving.\n\nWork to do: Win a Kia MVP, win a championship. That's the to-do shortlist for Luka. Both are reasonable, especially the MVP as he could win multiple such awards.\n\nSaid Irving: \"I want to see him win MVP. If it's not going to be this year, it's going to be in the eventual future.\"\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nBody of work: Discipline, work ethic, talent, competitive spirit. It's all there with Gilgeous-Alexander, who's making a strong bid to be the most dangerous scorer in the league at just 25.\n\nAbout that scoring: Gilgeous-Alexander mainly works the creases and openings inside the 3-point arc, searching for that spot to pull up for the jumper. It's all very Chris Paul-like, which is no accident since he took tips from Paul in 2019-20, their one season together.\n\nIn addition, he beats a path to the free-throw line, a sign of a creative and opportunistic player who looks to get buckets by any means necessary. He shot 87.4% from the line this season, and in the last two seasons, Gilgeous-Alexander has averaged a combined 30.7 points per game on 52.3% shooting.\n\nHe should make first-team All-NBA for the second straight season, mainly because -- aside from scoring and leading the Thunder to the top of the West -- his defense took another leap. His two steals per game tied him with the Sacramento Kings' De'Aaron Fox for No. 1 in the NBA.\n\nWork to do: Despite his knack for scoring, Gilgeous-Alexander is an average 3-point shooter (career 34.9%). Defenses will choose their poison and collapse and give him that space. If he can stretch the floor more, he'd be even better off the dribble -- and nearly unstoppable.\n\nFor a point guard, his passing is solid, not superb (career assist average 4.9). However, that improved this season as he posted 5.5 apg, his highest since 5.9 apg in 2020-21. That kind of improvement is why he's an MVP finalist.\n\nSaid Nikola Jokic: \"He's a special player. Not just this year. And the good thing about him, he wants to win. He doesn't care about numbers. He wants to win. And I think that's the best thing about him.\"", "source": {"uri": "nba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBA.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shaun_powell@nba.com", "name": "Shaun Powell", "type":

The lawsuit does not detail any incidents of overtly racist behavior, but rather focuses on the officers' lack of confidence in Edwards, which he blamed on racism.\n\n\"I was the first Black chief of police in a town that was predominately white, and I think there is a long history of Black people who have authority over groups of white employees where our judgment is questioned, competency is questioned, and I think that this was the case with me,\" Edwards said.\n\nSimonson did not return requests for comment Monday. The lawsuit, filed last week in U.S. District Court in Denver, names the city of Leadville as the sole defendant.\n\nEdwards started as Leadville's chief in August 2021. Within months, officers lodged complaints about his leadership style, including that he was rude and didn't listen to employees. Then, in October 2022, four white police department employees and two Latino employees brought a collective complaint against Edwards to Simonson, who hired a third-party investigator to examine the wide-ranging allegations.\n\nThe investigator found most of the complaints against the chief to be baseless or overblown, though some were substantiated, including claims that Edwards used profanity and appointed a field training officer who had not been fully trained, according to a three-page summary of the investigation provided to The Denver Post by Edwards' attorneys.\n\n\"Overall, the objective evidence and witness accounts of Edwards' conduct do not substantiate claims that Edwards engaged in unprofessional behavior, communications, discrimination or retaliation,\" the summary reads.\n\nThe outside investigation left open the possibility that the officers' rebellion was racially motivated, and noted the effort could have been politically motivated as well, as Edwards was running for Lake County sheriff at the time and at least two of the complaining officers supported other candidates.\n\n\"While the evidence does not plainly reveal that the complaint is racially motivated, the optics of a mostly white group of officers... complaining about their Black superior is suspect,\" the summary reads.\n\nEdwards alleges in the lawsuit that despite the third-party investigation's findings, Simonson nevertheless placed him on leave, hired an acting chief to replace him, and then instructed that acting chief to re-investigate the officers' complaints internally. He alleges she placed him on leave as retaliation after he spoke publicly about the third-party investigation's findings.\n\nSimonson ultimately demanded Edwards either resign or return to work under onerous conditions, the lawsuit alleges. When he rejected her offer, she fired him in February 2023, \"under the guise of informing him that she considered him to have 'resigned,' \" the lawsuit alleges.\n\nThe former chief is seeking unspecified monetary damages for both economic losses and emotional distress, according to the lawsuit. He said Monday he'd also like to see city employees trained on diversity and equity, and see the police department institute regular performance reviews.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shelly_bradbury@denverpost.com", "name": "Shelly Bradbury", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadville,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leadville, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leadville, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lake County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denver_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Denver Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HOUSING-BALLOT-INITIATIVES-3-0.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5294117647058824, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Now that we've seen at least five games from each team, it's time to revisit the biggest trends of the playoffs thus far and what we can learn from them.\n\nWhen ESPN's Neil Paine ranked the best players of the first round using advanced stats, Edwards finished second behind three-time MVP Nikola Jokic, but that was before Edwards' Timberwolves took the first two games of their series against Jokic's Nuggets in impressive fashion.\n\nAdd in the tendency for many all-in-one stats to favor big men over perimeter players and no one has been close to Edwards' value thus far. His 1.7 wins above replacement players by my WARP metric are 26% above the next highest total -- Kyrie Irving of the Dallas Mavericks, who benefited from playing an extra game.\n\nAlthough Edwards had a strong regular season and will likely earn All-NBA honors for the first time in his career, this is still a huge jump in play after he finished sixth in regular-season WARP. Looking at playoff series since 1997, seven players have averaged at least 0.25 WARP per game over the first two rounds of the playoffs without having been voted All-NBA first team to that point.\n\nIn many of those cases, like Paul Pierce in both 2002 and 2003 (Boston), Ben Wallace in 2003 (Detroit Pistons), Elton Brand in 2006 (LA Clippers), Chauncey Billups in 2009 (Denver) and Rajon Rondo in 2012 (Boston), the playoff run represented a high-water mark for their value. But two rising star shooting guards -- like Edwards -- made the leap to top-five players in real time. Both, coincidentally, while playing with Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nEntering the 2001 playoffs, 22-year-old Kobe Bryant was the Robin to O'Neal's Batman. But by the end of the Lakers' 15-1 romp through the playoffs, he'd emerged as a legitimate co-star, averaging 29.1 points, 7.3 rebounds and 6.4 assists. Dwyane Wade's 2005 playoff run at age 23, which ended in the conference finals despite his 27.4 points, 6.6 assists and 5.7 rebounds per game, was a taste of what was to come when he won Finals MVP the following year as the Heat won the title.\n\nAveraging 32.3 points, 6.8 rebounds and 5.8 assists in the playoffs, Edwards is on a similar pace. His emergence as potentially the best player in a series featuring the reigning Finals MVP changes the ceiling for what the Timberwolves can do, starting this postseason.\n\nAs important as Denver's clutch play was to the team's 2023 title run, the Nuggets also put together the strongest first halves of any playoff team a year ago, outscoring opponents by 9.0 points per 100 possessions according to NBA Advanced Stats. That has changed dramatically this year, when Denver's minus-17.0 net rating in first halves ranks ahead of only the long-eliminated Heat (minus-33.4).\n\nOnly one other team in the play-by-play stats era (back to 1997) has posted a worse first-half net rating over multiple playoff series: the 2013-14 Portland Trail Blazers at minus-17.1. There's an obvious reason for that: Most teams that get outscored so badly before halftime are quickly wiped out of the playoffs. Portland was a more acceptable minus-6.7 points per 100 possessions in the first half of its first-round win over the Houston Rockets before getting routed against the San Antonio Spurs in Round 2 (minus-29.5).\n\nAgainst the Los Angeles Lakers in Round 1, the Nuggets could afford to fall behind an average of 14.7 points per 100 possessions in the first half and still win the series in five games by virtue of their second-half comebacks. But Denver doesn't have that margin for error against Minnesota and must start better, particularly on offense. The Nuggets' 96.5 points per possession before halftime ranks 15th among playoff teams before its offensive rating jumps to 122.3 in the second half, the fifth-best mark in the playoffs.\n\nInevitably, shot-making is a factor here. The Nuggets are making 28% of their 3s in first halves and 37% after halftime. Denver's shot selection has been better over the final two quarters as well. According to Second Spectrum's quantified shot probability (qSP) metric, which factors the ability of the shooter in addition to the location, type of shot and distance to nearby defenders, the Nuggets' first-half shot quality ranks sixth in the NBA. Their second-half shots have been the best of any playoff team, but Denver needs that level of execution for a full 48 minutes.\n\nJust six teams since the first round of the playoffs expanded to best-of-seven series in 2003 had seen at least three of their first five wins come by 20-plus points. We've added a pair of teams to that short list in Boston and Oklahoma City Thunder this playoff.\n\nThe Celtics actually stand out even more with 20-plus point victories in four of their five wins. The only other team to have so many blowout wins through Game 1 of the second round was the 2016 San Antonio Spurs, who would be upset by an Oklahoma City team led by Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook despite winning Game 1 of the series by 32 points.\n\nIn general, early blowout wins haven't translated into titles. Boston's 2008 title team, which alternated three wins by 20-plus points and another by 19 with three road losses against the No. 8 seed Atlanta Hawks in Round 1, was the only champion from this group, with just one other team reaching the NBA Finals: the 2016 Golden State Warriors.\n\nThat track record is hardly reason for skepticism about the Celtics and Thunder, but it is a reminder the Mavericks can still come back and beat Oklahoma City despite a lopsided Game 1 loss. The Cavaliers' prospects for beating Boston as heavy underdogs entering the series are less favorable.\n\nOne of the most fascinating stats from this year's playoffs has been the success of teams that merely take more 3s. I first saw this from Lev Akabas of Sportico, who pointed out that through April playoff teams with more 3-point attempts in a game were 27-8. That has now extended to 34-13 (.723), which would blow away the best record for teams that take more 3s in any postseason. Previously, that came in 2015, when teams with more 3-point attempts went 50-31 (.617). So far in the 2024 playoffs, teams are already above .500 when attempting more 3s (22) than in 2015 (19).\n\nWhat's intriguing about this trend is that simply attempting more 3s hasn't been as strong a winning formula in recent regular seasons as 3-point volume has surged. Not coincidentally, regular-season win percentage for teams taking more 3-point attempts peaked at 55% in 2015 but has been in decline ever since. The 2022-23 regular season was the only one since 2019 in which teams with more 3-point attempts had an above-.500 record, and those teams won just 48% of games during this regular season.\n\nGiven how much it runs counter to recent trends, I'm not quite sure what to make of this one. Perhaps it's merely a fluke, since we're still talking about fewer than 50 games total. We certainly see more fluctuation in the winning percentages during the playoffs than during the regular season. This is one stat worth monitoring for the rest of the postseason.", "source": {"uri": "africa.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The motions argued were all filed by Edwards' attorney Dominic Vitantonio and centered around Edwards' bond, disclosure of grand jury proceedings, and a request to have separate trials for each of the alleged victims.\n\nA majority of the time in the roughly 45-minute hearing was spent arguing whether or not to separate the cases.\n\n\"We have to sever some of these things because otherwise, we're not going to have fairness,\" said Vitantonio.\n\nWildman disagreed saying, \"It's the defendant's burden to demonstrate actual prejudice. He can't do that. He's failed to do that and that's because there is no actual prejudice from keeping these charges joined.\"\n\n\"The jury deserves to know all of the illegal conduct that Mike Edwards committed in this case. Joinder is the rule, not the exception,\" said Wildman.\n\n\"I argue that he is a serial rapist. I don't say that to be mean to him and call him names. I think the facts bear that out. He has raped multiple women. That is the state's position. I think he's a danger,\" Wilman stated.\n\nJudge Cynthia Westcott Rice continued Edwards' bond at $750,000 with a condition of electronically monitored house arrest at Edwards' expense should he post it and took the other two motions under advisement.\n\nEdwards is due back in court next month for another pretrial hearing in Warren.", "source": {"uri": "wkbn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKBN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nadine_grimley@wkbn.com", "name": "Nadine Grimley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_rapist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serial rapist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumbull_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trumbull County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Trumbull County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prejudice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rice University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preliminary_hearing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preliminary hearing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_arrest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House arrest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://www.wkbn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2024/05/Michael-Edwards-hearing.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542745", "eventUri": "eng-9542745", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Warren, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 452987382, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 102, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 102}}}

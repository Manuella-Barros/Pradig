National Guard on that day.\n\nColonel Earl Matthews came forward as a whistleblower to the House subcommittee reviewing the January 6 Select Committee's investigation.\n\nHe sat down with DailyMail.com two weeks after the public hearing to explain what he saw happen that day.\n\nHe claims that Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, and then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, were plotting to disobey any orders handed down by Trump because they 'unreasonably' assumed the then-president was going to break the law and try to use the D.C. National Guard (DCNG) to stop certification of the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nA lot has been made about the breakdown in military and administration communication when it came to the timeline of deploying DCNG to the Capitol.\n\nBut Matthews claims senior military leadership was solely focused on getting the heat off of them and putting it back onto Trump.\n\nCol. Earl Matthews was the Staff Judge Advocate on January 6, 2021. He came forward as a whistleblower before the subcommittee reviewing the investigation by the Select Committee on January 6\n\nMatthews told DailyMail.com that Army leadership essentially stripped then-President Donald Trump of his authority as Commander-in-Chief on January 6, 2021 because they plotted to go against any orders from him to deploy the National Guard to the Capitol that day\n\nThe Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, Matthews claims, was more than happy to lean into this narrative and blame the entire ordeal on the then-president.\n\nBut Matthews says that senior military leadership essentially stripped the president of his authority as commander-in-chief by preemptively planning to go against orders because they didn't like the optics of uniformed soldiers at the Capitol.\n\n'I think a very plausible argument can be made that through no fault of his own, President Trump's command authority over both the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Army itself had been surreptitiously curtailed by the senior leadership of the Army on January 6, 2021,' Matthews told DailyMail.com.\n\nHe continued: 'Army leadership had unreasonably anticipated an 'unlawful order' from the President, an order that the President had no plans to issue, and were preemptively seeking to curtail his discretion to issue such an order.'\n\nMatthews, who was the Staff Judge Advocate of the DCNG during the riot, was on the consequential and highly discussed phone call the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021 with McCarthy, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other senior leadership.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund pleaded during the call for the DCNG to help law enforcement in responding to the Capitol riot. And DCNG Commander Maj. Gen. William Walker had prepared his troops to deploy.\n\nSund said at a congressional hearing, and Matthews reiterated in his interview with DailyMail.com, that Army Staff Director Walter Piatt and Chief of Staff for Operations Charles Flynn were part of that discussion, despite the latter claiming under oath he was not on the call.\n\nThe more than three-hour delay of deployment of the D.C. National Guard to the Capitol on January 6, 2021 has been at the center of the claim that Trump tried to engage in insurrection\n\nMatthews claims that Army Staff Director Walter Piatt (left) and Chief of Staff for Operations Charles Flynn (right) were 'nonchalant' on the call during the breaching of the Capitol where U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund pleaded for National Guard back up\n\nMatthews said on the call Flynn and Piatt seemed 'almost disinterested' in Sund's concerns and displayed no urgency toward getting the National Guard to the U.S. Capitol to respond to rioters.\n\n'Flynn and Piatt displayed what I would characterize as a nonchalant attitude during the roughly 25 minute call,' the Colonel claimed.\n\nAdditionally, he said the two Army leaders 'didn't like the optics of the Guard coming to the Capitol,' even though Piatt said under oath to Congress that he never mentioned 'optics.'\n\n'Both Piatt and Flynn were obsessively focused on what they considered the bad optics of military personnel at the Capitol during the certification of the election,' Matthews told DailyMail.com.\n\n'They both stated that they believed that what was transpiring at the Capitol was most appropriately handled by civilian law enforcement personnel,' he continued, 'despite the fact the capabilities and resources of the U.S. Capitol Police and MPD were quickly being overwhelmed and the National Guard typically assists civilian police authorities in such circumstances.'\n\nMatthews detailed: 'Piatt and Flynn wanted the D.C. National Guard to find locations around the city where it could relieve MPD officers performing traffic or other duties in order to allow those civilian police officers to deploy to the Capitol.'\n\nCritics blame the three-hour-and-nineteen-minute delay of the DC National Guard arrival at the Capitol for not stopping the riot sooner after Trump's supporters breached the building\n\nThe January 6 Committee was led by seven Democrats and two Republicans now no longer in Congress, former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.\n\nThe final report from the select committee acknowledges that Trump did approve deployment of the National Guard despite claims that he did not give the proper authorizations, which resulted in the more than three-hour delay.\n\n'Former President Trump's eagerness to engage the U.S. military to play a visible role in addressing domestic unrest during the late spring and summer of 2020 does appear to have prompted senior military leadership to take precautions, in preparing for the joint session against the possibility that the DC Guard might be ordered to deploy for an improper use,' the final report reads.\n\nBut Matthews confirms the President's authority was ignored or completely balked by Piatt and Flynn, as well as other military leaders.\n\nAnd he says it is contradictory to try and blame Trump for the delay while also claiming he was attempting to use the DCNG to stop certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nTrump's then-Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller reiterated to DailyMail.com last month that Trump did authorize the National Guard during an Oval Office meeting days before January 6, 2021.\n\nHe also said that the January 6 Committee threatened him to stop speaking publicly about his recounting of the events surrounding the Capitol riot.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piatt_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piatt County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Piatt County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Advocate_General's_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Judge Advocate General's Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_the_January_6_Attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Sund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Sund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Milley", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Milley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_D._McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan D.

National Guard on that day.\n\nColonel Earl Matthews came forward as a whistleblower to the House subcommittee reviewing the January 6 Select Committee's investigation.\n\nHe sat down with DailyMail.com two weeks after the public hearing to explain what he saw happen that day.\n\nHe claims that Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, and then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, were plotting to disobey any orders handed down by Trump because they 'unreasonably' assumed the then-president was going to break the law and try to use the D.C. National Guard (DCNG) to stop certification of the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nA lot has been made about the breakdown in military and administration communication when it came to the timeline of deploying DCNG to the Capitol.\n\nBut Matthews claims senior military leadership was solely focused on getting the heat off of them and putting it back onto Trump.\n\nThe Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, Matthews claims, was more than happy to lean into this narrative and blame the entire ordeal on the then-president.\n\nBut Matthews says that senior military leadership essentially stripped the president of his authority as commander-in-chief by preemptively planning to go against orders because they didn't like the optics of uniformed soldiers at the Capitol.\n\n'I think a very plausible argument can be made that through no fault of his own, President Trump's command authority over both the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Army itself had been surreptitiously curtailed by the senior leadership of the Army on January 6, 2021,' Matthews told DailyMail.com.\n\nHe continued: 'Army leadership had unreasonably anticipated an 'unlawful order' from the President, an order that the President had no plans to issue, and were preemptively seeking to curtail his discretion to issue such an order.'\n\nMatthews, who was the Staff Judge Advocate of the DCNG during the riot, was on the consequential and highly discussed phone call the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021 with McCarthy, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other senior leadership.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund pleaded during the call for the DCNG to help law enforcement in responding to the Capitol riot. And DCNG Commander Maj. Gen. William Walker had prepared his troops to deploy.\n\nSund said at a congressional hearing, and Matthews reiterated in his interview with DailyMail.com, that Army Staff Director Walter Piatt and Chief of Staff for Operations Charles Flynn were part of that discussion, despite the latter claiming under oath he was not on the call.\n\nMatthews said on the call Flynn and Piatt seemed 'almost disinterested' in Sund's concerns and displayed no urgency toward getting the National Guard to the U.S. Capitol to respond to rioters.\n\n'Flynn and Piatt displayed what I would characterize as a nonchalant attitude during the roughly 25 minute call,' the Colonel claimed.\n\nAdditionally, he said the two Army leaders 'didn't like the optics of the Guard coming to the Capitol,' even though Piatt said under oath to Congress that he never mentioned 'optics.'\n\n'Both Piatt and Flynn were obsessively focused on what they considered the bad optics of military personnel at the Capitol during the certification of the election,' Matthews told DailyMail.com.\n\nMany are now demanding: \"START THE COURT MARTIAL PROCEEDINGS\":\n\nIf Col. Matthews' testimony is correct, it feels more like treason than a \"court martial\".\n\nGrok was a bit more cautious with the news, giving these details:\n\nThe claim that \"Military Brass Stripped Trump of His Power as Commander-in-Chief on J6\" is based on a whistleblower's account reported by the Daily Mail and The Gateway Pundit. Colonel Earl Matthews, in these reports, alleged that army leaders ignored Donald Trump's authority and plotted to block orders to deploy the National Guard to the Capitol on January 6. The reports suggest that the army leadership, including Mark Milley and Ryan McCarthy, took these steps under the assumption that President Trump would issue unlawful orders, despite no evidence that Trump planned to use the National Guard to interfere with the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nIt's important to note that this claim is controversial and contested. Critics argue that the Constitution and laws of the United States designate the President as the Commander in Chief, and such authority cannot be stripped without following legal procedures. The President's authority as Commander in Chief is a constitutional power that is not easily revoked.\n\nTherefore, while there are claims and whistleblower allegations suggesting military brass attempted to circumvent Trump's authority during the events of January 6, the factual and legal basis for these claims remains a matter of significant debate and contention.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District of Columbia National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piatt_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Piatt County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Piatt County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_the_January_6_Attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Milley", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Milley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_D._McCarthy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan D.

Major Michael Brooks, Col. Earl Matthews, Brig. Gen. Aaron Dean, and Capt. Timothy Nick, all of the D.C. National Guard, are sworn in during a hearing in Washington on April 17, 2024. (House Administration Committee via The Epoch Times)\n\nSenior military leaders plotted to disobey then-President Donald Trump's orders on Jan. 6, 2021, because they \"unreasonably\" thought he might try to use the D.C. National Guard to block certification of the 2020 presidential election, according to whistleblower Col. Earl Matthews.\n\n\"I think a very plausible argument can be made that through no fault of his own, President Trump's command authority over both the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Army itself had been surreptitiously curtailed by the senior leadership of the Army on January 6, 2021,\" Col. Matthews, told The Daily Mail in a May 3 interview.\n\n\"Army leadership had unreasonably anticipated an 'unlawful order' from the President, an order that the President had no plans to issue, and were preemptively seeking to curtail his discretion to issue such an order,\" he added.\n\nThe remarks by Col. Matthews dovetail with the contents of a book written in mid-2021 titled \"I Alone Can Fix It\" that claims then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, and other military leaders informally planned for different ways to disobey potential orders issued by President Trump that they disagreed with.\n\nThe DOD did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Col. Matthews's claims.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Col. Matthews was serving as the top attorney to Maj. Gen. William Walker, who at the time was the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard.\n\nMaj. Gen. Walker conveyed a request for assistance at around 1:50 p.m. on Jan. 6 but the Guard was not deployed to the Capitol until about 5:10 p.m., according to a timeline from the D.C. National Guard.\n\nQuestions remain on why it took around three hours to deploy D.C. National Guard troops to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in response to unrest as Congress convened to certify the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWhile it remains unclear exactly why there was such a long delay to mobilize and deploy the Guard troops from an armory just two miles away from the Capitol, a breakdown in communications and concern about the optics of using armed soldiers in response to the unrest have been posited as key factors.\n\nThe Pentagon Inspector General's report and a report from the Jan. 6 committee that investigated the events of that day concluded that no Pentagon officials deliberately delayed the deployment.\n\nHowever, Col. Matthews has challenged the Pentagon's narrative about the events of Jan. 6. He was also among four whistleblowers who testified before Congress on April 17 about the delay in the deployment of the Guard on that day. Lawmakers were convening on Capitol Hill to certify the electoral votes and make the results of the 2020 election official.\n\nIn his 36-page memo, Col. Matthews makes two major accusations. The first is that two Army generals -- Gen. Charles Flynn, who served as deputy chief of staff for operations on Jan. 6, 2021, and Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, the director of Army staff -- lied to Congress about their response to calls for quick deployment of the D.C. Guard that day as the unrest was unfolding.\n\nThe second key allegation is that the Pentagon's narrative of the events of Jan. 6, as outlined in the Department of Defense (DOD) Inspector General's report, was full of factual inaccuracies.\n\n\"Every leader in the D.C. Guard wanted to respond and knew they could respond to the riot at the seat of government\" before they were given approval to do so on Jan. 6, Col. Matthews wrote in his memo. But instead, D.C. Guard officials sat \"stunned watching in the Armory,\" he wrote.\n\nIn his memo, Col. Matthews accused Gen. Flynn and Lt. Gen. Piatt of lying to Congress when they denied ever saying that the Guard should not be deployed to the Capitol.\n\nCol. Matthews elaborated on his interview with The Daily Mail, claiming that Gen. Flynn and Lt. Gen. Piatt were both \"obsessively focused\" on the bad optics of deploying military personnel to the Capitol while Congress was certifying the electoral votes.\n\nHe said that they both believed that civilian law enforcement personnel could handle the job and felt that the best use of the Guard would be to relieve civilian law enforcement at other locations to free them up to deploy to the Capitol.\n\nNeither Gen. Flynn nor Lt. Gen. Piatt could be reached for comment and the Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHowever, when Col. Matthews's memo was first released, Army spokesperson Mike Brady told Politico that \"Gen. Flynn and Lt. Gen. Piatt have been open, honest and thorough in their sworn testimony with Congress and DOD investigators.\"\n\nA Pentagon spokesman told The Epoch Times in an earlier statement that, \"we stand by our January 6th Report.\"\n\nThe April 17 congressional hearing titled \"Three Years Later: D.C. National Guard Whistleblowers Speak Out on January 6 Delay\" has shed further light on the events of Jan. 6.\n\nAt the hearing, whistleblowers alleged that then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy made multiple false claims, including that he spoke to the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard on two separate occasions after officials requested that the Guard be deployed to the Capitol.\n\nAfter Maj. Gen. Walker conveyed a request from the U.S. Capitol Police for Guard personnel, Mr. McCarthy called Maj. Gen. Walker at 2:14 p.m. and instructed the Guard to stand by, according to the timeline of events.\n\nBut the whistleblowers claimed that this call never took place.\n\n\"At no time did Gen. Walker take any calls, nor did we ever hear from the secretary on any of the ongoing conference calls or the secure video teleconferencing throughout the day,\" Capt. Timothy Nick, who served as Maj. Gen. Walker's personal assistant on Jan. 6, 2021, said during the hearing. \"This I know because I was with the command general the entire time recording the events.\"\n\nDespite Gen. Walker conveying the request for assistance at about 1:50 p.m., the Guard was not deployed to the Capitol until about 5:10 p.m.\n\n\"This was a dereliction of duty by the secretary of the Army,\" Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.), one of the members of the committee, said.\n\nMr. McCarthy refused to appear before the panel, Mr. Murphy said.\n\nChristopher Miller, the acting secretary of defense at the time, authorized Guard deployment at 3:11 p.m., but Mr. McCarthy took the order and decided to draw up a plan before ordering the deployment, according to military timelines and testimony from Mr. McCarthy and others.\n\n\"You never would employ our personnel, whether it's on an American street or a foreign street, without putting together a [plan],\" Mr. McCarthy told the now-disbanded House Jan. 6 committee.\n\nMr. McCarthy could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Pentagon Inspector General's report alleges that Gen. Walker received a call from Mr. McCarthy at 4:35 p.m. informing him that Mr. Miller had approved the request to deploy the D.C. Guard to the Capitol.\n\nGen.

Matthews dovetail with the contents of a book written in mid-2021 titled \"I Alone Can Fix It\" that claims then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Mark Milley, and other military leaders informally planned for different ways to disobey potential orders issued by President Trump that they disagreed with.\n\nThe DOD did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Col. Matthews's claims.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Col. Matthews was serving as the top attorney to Maj. Gen. William Walker, who at the time was the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard.\n\nMaj. Gen. Walker conveyed a request for assistance at around 1:50 p.m. on Jan. 6 but the Guard was not deployed to the Capitol until about 5:10 p.m., according to a timeline from the D.C. National Guard.\n\nHowever, Col. Matthews has challenged the Pentagon's narrative about the events of Jan. 6. He was also among four whistleblowers who testified before Congress on April 17 about the delay in the deployment of the Guard on that day. Lawmakers were convening on Capitol Hill to certify the electoral votes and make the results of the 2020 election official.\n\nIn his 36-page memo, Col. Matthews makes two major accusations. The first is that two Army generals -- Gen. Charles Flynn, who served as deputy chief of staff for operations on Jan. 6, 2021, and Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, the director of Army staff -- lied to Congress about their response to calls for quick deployment of the D.C. Guard that day as the unrest was unfolding.\n\n\"Every leader in the D.C. Guard wanted to respond and knew they could respond to the riot at the seat of government\" before they were given approval to do so on Jan. 6, Col. Matthews wrote in his memo. But instead, D.C. Guard officials sat \"stunned watching in the Armory,\" he wrote.\n\nIn his memo, Col. Matthews accused Gen. Flynn and Lt. Gen. Piatt of lying to Congress when they denied ever saying that the Guard should not be deployed to the Capitol.\n\nCol. Matthews elaborated on his interview with The Daily Mail, claiming that Gen. Flynn and Lt. Gen. Piatt were both \"obsessively focused\" on the bad optics of deploying military personnel to the Capitol while Congress was certifying the electoral votes.\n\nHe said that they both believed that civilian law enforcement personnel could handle the job and felt that the best use of the Guard would be to relieve civilian law enforcement at other locations to free them up to deploy to the Capitol.\n\nNeither Gen. Flynn nor Lt. Gen. Piatt could be reached for comment and the Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt the hearing, whistleblowers alleged that then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy made multiple false claims, including that he spoke to the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard on two separate occasions after officials requested that the Guard be deployed to the Capitol.\n\nBut the whistleblowers claimed that this call never took place.\n\n\"At no time did Gen. Walker take any calls, nor did we ever hear from the secretary on any of the ongoing conference calls or the secure video teleconferencing throughout the day,\" Capt. Timothy Nick, who served as Maj. Gen. Walker's personal assistant on Jan. 6, 2021, said during the hearing. \"This I know because I was with the command general the entire time recording the events.\"\n\nDespite Gen. Walker conveying the request for assistance at about 1:50 p.m., the Guard was not deployed to the Capitol until about 5:10 p.m.\n\n\"This was a dereliction of duty by the secretary of the Army,\" Rep. Greg Murphy (R-N.C.), one of the members of the committee, said.\n\nMr. McCarthy refused to appear before the panel, Mr. Murphy said.\n\nChristopher Miller, the acting secretary of defense at the time, authorized Guard deployment at 3:11 p.m., but Mr. McCarthy took the order and decided to draw up a plan before ordering the deployment, according to military timelines and testimony from Mr. McCarthy and others.\n\n\"You never would employ our personnel, whether it's on an American street or a foreign street, without putting together a [plan],\" Mr. McCarthy told the now-disbanded House Jan. 6 committee.\n\nMr. McCarthy could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe Pentagon Inspector General's report alleges that Gen. Walker received a call from Mr. McCarthy at 4:35 p.m. informing him that Mr. Miller had approved the request to deploy the D.C. Guard to the Capitol.\n\nGen. Walker denied that claim in an interview with The Washington Post.\n\n\"Our Army has never failed us and did not do so on January 6, 2021,\" Col. Matthews told Politico. \"However, occasionally some of our Army leaders have failed us and they did so on January 6th. Then they lied about it and tried to cover it up.

However, as events unfolded at the Capitol, the National Guard was nowhere to be seen. It showed up hours later, only after the situation was such that Trump and his supporters were tarred as \"insurrectionists\" and targeted for arrests. Now, a whistleblower has come forward to allege that one of Trump's problems was that military leadership, starting with Mark Milley, made the deliberate decision to ignore Trump's order. That's court-martial stuff, along with the possibility of domestic terrorism and, ironically, insurrection.\n\nWhenever thousands of people descend on a city, there should be a large police force in place. And when hundreds of thousands come to D.C. to complain about an election outcome, the National Guard should be there. And yet the troops weren't. Here's what we know.\n\nDespite being warned about potential agitators and violence, Nancy Pelosi and D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser refused to put the National Guard on standby. We also know that even the improperly convened, hyper-partisan, and corrupt January 6 committee acknowledged that Trump approved deploying the National Guard days before the event, greenlighting its immediate deployment in case things got out of hand.\n\nAnd yet it wasn't until well after 3 p.m. and into the 4:00 hour that the National Guard was mobilized. Troops finally showed up after 5:00. Significantly, by this time, the insurrection narrative (which could not have been organic so, therefore, must have been planned) was in place. These tweets are proof of the narrative instantly going into place:\n\nIt doesn't take a genius to know that this was a set-up. And now, a whistleblower has come forward to say that the Pentagon was part of the set-up, going so far as to disobey Trump's National Guard authorization for hours, enabling the narrative to be set.\n\nAccording to Colonel Earl Matthews, the senior Pentagon leadership wasn't just dragging its heels. Instead, it had put plans in place to refuse to comply with any order that President Trump, the constitutional Commander in Chief of the United States military, issued to deploy the National Guard:\n\nBut Matthews says that senior military leadership essentially stripped the president of his authority as commander-in-chief by preemptively planning to go against orders because they didn't like the optics of uniformed soldiers at the Capitol.\n\n'I think a very plausible argument can be made that through no fault of his own, President Trump's command authority over both the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Army itself had been surreptitiously curtailed by the senior leadership of the Army on January 6, 2021,' Matthews told DailyMail.com.\n\nHe continued: 'Army leadership had unreasonably anticipated an 'unlawful order' from the President, an order that the President had no plans to issue, and were preemptively seeking to curtail his discretion to issue such an order.'\n\nMatthews, who was the Staff Judge Advocate of the DCNG during the riot, was on the consequential and highly discussed phone call the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021 with [former Army Secretary Ryan] McCarthy, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other senior leadership.\n\nMatthews also said that while the Chief of Staff for Operations, Charles Flynn, had testified under oath that he was not on the call, he was, in fact, on the call, along with Army Staff Director Walter Piatt.\n\nBoth Flynn and Piatt, says Matthews, were seemingly disinterested in U.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund's pleas for reinforcements. Instead, they were worried about \"the optics of the Guard coming to the Capitol.\" Ironically, let me add, they were seemingly unconcerned when the Pentagon locked the Capitol area down completely upon Biden's inauguration and long afterward. Once Trump was gone, showing Biden's military might seemed to be the name of the game.\n\nMatthews was not ambiguous in his take on what happened. He says that military officials deliberately and absolutely disobeyed Trump's orders:\n\n'Former President Trump's eagerness to engage the U.S. military to play a visible role in addressing domestic unrest during the late spring and summer of 2020 does appear to have prompted senior military leadership to take precautions, in preparing for the joint session against the possibility that the DC Guard might be ordered to deploy for an improper use,' the [January 6 committee] final report reads.\n\nBut Matthews confirms the President's authority was ignored or completely balked by Piatt and Flynn, as well as other military leaders.\n\nAnd he says it is contradictory to try and blame Trump for the delay while also claiming he was attempting to use the DCNG to stop certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nIn sum, Matthews alleges that a cabal within the American military leadership planned to -- and did -- ignore an order from their constitutional Commander-in-Chief. They did so despite having reason to believe that doing so ran the risk of creating dangerous conditions in and around the United States Capitol, and, in fact, those dangerous conditions occurred. I've listed at the end of this post the sections of the Uniform Code of Military Justice that apply to their alleged conduct, including domestic terrorism and insurrection. These officers should all face a court-martial (and the retired ones can be returned to active duty) because if you want an insurrection and a coup, this was it.\n\nThe President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices...\n\n10 U.S. Code \u00a7 881 - Art. 81.

National Guard on that day.\n\nColonel Earl Matthews came forward as a whistleblower to the House subcommittee reviewing the January 6 Select Committee's investigation.\n\nHe sat down with DailyMail.com two weeks after the public hearing to explain what he saw happen that day.\n\nHe claims that Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, and then-Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, were plotting to disobey any orders handed down by Trump because they 'unreasonably' assumed the then-president was going to break the law and try to use the D.C. National Guard (DCNG) to stop certification of the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nA lot has been made about the breakdown in military and administration communication when it came to the timeline of deploying DCNG to the Capitol.\n\nBut Matthews claims senior military leadership was solely focused on getting the heat off of them and putting it back onto Trump.\n\nThe Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, Matthews claims, was more than happy to lean into this narrative and blame the entire ordeal on the then-president.\n\nBut Matthews says that senior military leadership essentially stripped the president of his authority as commander-in-chief by preemptively planning to go against orders because they didn't like the optics of uniformed soldiers at the Capitol.\n\n'I think a very plausible argument can be made that through no fault of his own, President Trump's command authority over both the D.C. National Guard and the U.S. Army itself had been surreptitiously curtailed by the senior leadership of the Army on January 6, 2021,' Matthews told DailyMail.com.\n\nHe continued: 'Army leadership had unreasonably anticipated an 'unlawful order' from the President, an order that the President had no plans to issue, and were preemptively seeking to curtail his discretion to issue such an order.'\n\nMatthews, who was the Staff Judge Advocate of the DCNG during the riot, was on the consequential and highly discussed phone call the afternoon of Jan. 6, 2021 with McCarthy, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and other senior leadership.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund pleaded during the call for the DCNG to help law enforcement in responding to the Capitol riot. And DCNG Commander Maj. Gen. William Walker had prepared his troops to deploy.\n\nSund said at a congressional hearing, and Matthews reiterated in his interview with DailyMail.com, that Army Staff Director Walter Piatt and Chief of Staff for Operations Charles Flynn were part of that discussion, despite the latter claiming under oath he was not on the call.\n\nMatthews said on the call Flynn and Piatt seemed 'almost disinterested' in Sund's concerns and displayed no urgency toward getting the National Guard to the U.S. Capitol to respond to rioters.\n\n'Flynn and Piatt displayed what I would characterize as a nonchalant attitude during the roughly 25 minute call,' the Colonel claimed.\n\nAdditionally, he said the two Army leaders 'didn't like the optics of the Guard coming to the Capitol,' even though Piatt said under oath to Congress that he never mentioned 'optics.'\n\n'Both Piatt and Flynn were obsessively focused on what they considered the bad optics of military personnel at the Capitol during the certification of the election,' Matthews told DailyMail.com.\n\nMany are now demanding: \"START THE COURT MARTIAL PROCEEDINGS\":\n\nIf Col. Matthews' testimony is correct, it feels more like treason than a \"court martial\".\n\nBut we will have to see where the dust settles.\n\nHere is Col. Matthew's full testimony:\n\nGrok was a bit more cautious with the news, giving these details:\n\nFull text copied below if this is easier to read:\n\nThe claim that \"Military Brass Stripped Trump of His Power as Commander-in-Chief on J6\" is based on a whistleblower's account reported by the Daily Mail and The Gateway Pundit. Colonel Earl Matthews, in these reports, alleged that army leaders ignored Donald Trump's authority and plotted to block orders to deploy the National Guard to the Capitol on January 6. The reports suggest that the army leadership, including Mark Milley and Ryan McCarthy, took these steps under the assumption that President Trump would issue unlawful orders, despite no evidence that Trump planned to use the National Guard to interfere with the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nIt's important to note that this claim is controversial and contested. Critics argue that the Constitution and laws of the United States designate the President as the Commander in Chief, and such authority cannot be stripped without following legal procedures. The President's authority as Commander in Chief is a constitutional power that is not easily revoked.\n\nTherefore, while there are claims and whistleblower allegations suggesting military brass attempted to circumvent Trump's authority during the events of January 6, the factual and legal basis for these claims remains a matter of significant debate and contention.\n\nI'm no expert, but a Colonel is pretty high up, right?\n\nWatch more here from the VNN:", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

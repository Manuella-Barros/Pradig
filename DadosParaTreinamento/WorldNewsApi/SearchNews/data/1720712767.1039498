{"id": 232097416, "title": "Simon Harris blasts Sinn Fein\u2019s election performance as \u2018unmitigated disaster\u2019", "text": "The Irish premier has branded Sinn Fein\u2019s performance in the council elections as an \u201cunmitigated disaster\u201d, but has refused to call an early general election despite government parties performing better than expected. It comes as the leader of Sinn Fein said she is \u201csorry\u201d that her candidates did not perform better in Ireland\u2019s local elections, amid criticism of the party\u2019s strategy in the council races. Mary Lou McDonald made the comments as vote counting continues for Ireland\u2019s local and European elections. Simon Harris said that the Irish public did not want to \u201cbuy what Sinn Fein were selling\u201d. Mr Harris also accused Ms McDonald of making comments that were \u201cquite insulting\u201d to the Irish people when she tried to \u201csecond guess\u201d them. Speaking at the RDS count centre in south Dublin, Mr Harris said: \u201cI was very disappointed to hear her comments in relation to, \u2018maybe the people on this occasion didn\u2019t really understand this\u2019. \u201cThe people of this country are sovereign. \u201cAs I travelled around the country, I think the people knew exactly what Sinn Fein were selling, and they just didn\u2019t want to buy it.\u201d He added: \u201cI think what Sinn Fein needs to realise here is that the Irish people will see through the noise. \u201cThe Irish people don\u2019t believe they live in a failed state. \u201cThe Irish people don\u2019t believe in all of the negativity and the \u2018rah rah rah\u2019 but the Irish people want is pragmatic delivery. \u201cThe Irish people do want change. \u201cThey want credible change. \u201cThat\u2019s the sort of change I\u2019m offering with Fine Gael and our coalition colleagues. \u201cThis is the second local election that Mary Lou McDonald has had the honour of leading her party into, it\u2019s the second local elections that have been an unmitigated disaster for them. \u201cThey can carry out all the reviews they want, I don\u2019t get distracted by their business. \u201cLeadership issues in Sinn Fein are a matter for Sinn Fein.\u201d Asked why he would not call a general election off the back of the results, Mr Harris said: \u201cBecause we\u2019ve lots to do\u201d. Earlier, Ms McDonald said she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d that more of her candidates were not elected. Early indications show there will be no Sinn Fein surge, while Government parties do not appear to have suffered a major electoral blow. The fuller picture of the state of play for political parties and independents will become clear throughout the evening. Commentators have noted that Sinn Fein\u2019s strategy in some constituencies had led to its vote being split too much. Ms McDonald said: \u201cClearly, we didn\u2019t get that right.\u201d She added: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the number of the candidates, but the fact that in so many cases they were first-time candidates.\u201d Speaking at a count centre in Dublin, Ms McDonald said: \u201cWe have made some gains, they are modest, but they\u2019re there. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been our day. \u201cClearly frustrations \u2013 anger indeed \u2013 with government policy on this occasion has translated into votes for independents and others. \u201cWe have to now prepare ourselves for the general election, whenever that will happen. \u201cWe\u2019ll take time to reflect.\u201d Asked about whether the lacklustre result would affect her leadership, Ms McDonald said she \u201cabsolutely\u201d committed to staying on in the role. \u201cI will lead this reflection and this process,\u201d she said. On Saturday, Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said the expectation that Sinn Fein would be in the next government has been \u201cshattered\u201d by the initial indications in the local elections. Irish voters have voted to elect almost 1,000 new councillors, 14 members to the European Parliament and, for the first time, one city\u2019s citizens were asked to pick their mayor. Despite winning 24.5% of first preference votes in a historic result in the 2020 general election, and hovering above 30% in opinion polls for a long time, the fate of many of Sinn Fein\u2019s candidates is expected to depend on transfers. However, Sinn Fein has made some gains on the 2019 election, where it won around 9% of first preference votes and 81 council seats out of 949. Ireland\u2019s deputy premier Micheal Martin argued his Fianna Fail party had performed \u201cfar better\u201d than predicted, while Mr Donohoe said the results so far showed Fine Gael was not a spent political force. Despite the strong showing for government parties so far, ministers stuck to the line that the coalition government would \u201cgo the full distance\u201d to February or March before a general election is called. Asked about Fine Gael\u2019s performance compared with Sinn Fein, Mr Donohoe said: \u201cOverall, the portrayal that some have offered of Fine Gael as a tired party \u2013 that narrative, that claim, has been shattered by the results that we\u2019re seeing potentially coming through at the moment.\u201d Mr Martin said the focus would be on putting together a budget for October as his party looked to win an MEP seat in the Midlands-North-West constituency for the first time for 15 years. \u201cThe idea that Fianna Fail would be coming in a distant third is completely disproven,\u201d the Tanaiste said. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking at opinion polls now for the last three years. \u201cThis \u2018internet panel\u2019 polling having Fianna Fail at 14% and 15%, clearly Fianna Fail will be well ahead of that and will be over 20% by the time all of these counts are collated and put together. \u201cWe put up a very robust performance and we\u2019re holding our own compared to our performance in the general election of 2020.\u201d The full results of the elections will take days to be finalised thanks to Ireland\u2019s system of proportional representation which allows voters to rank every candidate in each race by order of preference. The process means ballot papers are sorted and counted multiple times by hand. Counting in the European elections began on Sunday morning and the results of the first tally will not be declared until after 10pm because of ongoing voting in other EU states. Irish politics is currently dominated by a housing crisis, the cost of living and migration. The coalition partnership of Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and the Green Party has been battling criticism domestically and on the continent over other issues including climate action, agriculture policy and defence co-operation in the EU. Political parties have been relying on opinion polls to judge voter sentiment for the previous four years since the last nationwide elections. The results will also be an indicator of how new Fine Gael leader and Mr Harris is faring, having assumed the roles some eight weeks ago after the shock resignation of Leo Varadkar. The first results for the European elections will not be announced until polling closes in each member state late tonight. In Dublin, incomplete tallies suggested Fianna Fail\u2019s Barry Andrews and Fine Gael\u2019s Regina Doherty were leading. Green Party incumbent Ciaran Cuffe, Independent Ireland candidate Niall Boylan, Labour representative Aodhan O Riordain and Sinn Fein hopefuls Daithi Doolan and Lynn Boylan will be fighting over the remaining two seats. In the South constituency, Fine Gael\u2019s Sean Kelly and Fianna Fail\u2019s Billy Kelleher are considered to be in contention for re-election. Sinn Fein will be hoping to regain a seat in the region with Kathleen Funchion, while Independent TD Michael McNamara is predicted to take the fourth seat. In Midlands-North-West, there are 27 candidates fighting for five seats in the massive electoral region which spans 15 counties. Fine Gael is running former jockey Nina Carberry alongside incumbent MEP Maria Walsh, while Fianna Fail has fielded three candidates: Lisa Chambers, Barry Cowen and Niall Blaney. Doubt has been raised over Sinn Fein\u2019s chances after splitting the vote with two hopefuls: current MEP Chris MacManus and Michelle Gildernew. Observers eyeballing stacks of ballots processed by first-preference determined the main contenders, by midday, were Ms Walsh, Mr Cowen and Independent candidate Luke \u201cMing\u201d Flanagan, with Ms Carberry, Ms Chambers, Mr MacManus, Aontu leader Peadar Toibin and former RTE correspondent Ciaran Mullooly also performing well. Speaking to reporters at the TF Royal count centre in Castlebar, Co Mayo, Mr Flanagan said: \u201cThere\u2019s quite a lot of candidates here who are going to get a significant amount of votes and I think it\u2019s nearly odds on that we\u2019re going to have some sort of a recount. \u201cAll I know is we booked a place to stay for the next week in Castlebar.\u201d In the south west, voters in Limerick city and county also had the opportunity to directly elect a mayor with executive powers on long-term strategic planning. Tallies show that Independent candidate John Moran, a former secretary general at the Department of Finance, is in the lead, with Independent candidate Helen O\u2019Donnell in second place.", "summary": "The leader of Sinn Fein said she was \u2018sorry\u2019 that her candidates did not perform better.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sinn-fein-fine-gael-micheal-martin-fianna-fail-european-b1163168.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/09/18/5412a693ff02e5517f133e66ab8e9728Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE4MDM4ODc1-2.76349415.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:05:09", "author": "Cillian Sherlock", "authors": ["Cillian Sherlock"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.354}

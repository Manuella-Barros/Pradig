It is one of the highlights of the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris.\n\nThe bell, which bears the inscription 'Paris 2024', is located at the edge of the track at the iconic location.\n\nAfter the Games, the clock will be moved to Notre Dame Cathedral as part of the renovation, after it was nearly destroyed by fire in 2019.\n\nThe fire caused severe damage to the historic cathedral, causing the spire and much of the roof to collapse.\n\nExtensive restoration work was required to preserve the iconic building.\n\nOnce the restoration is complete, the bell used during the Paris Olympics will be hung in one of the cathedral's bell towers, so that the sound of Olympic glory will be heard from Notre Dame for years to come.\n\nNoah Lyles of the United States rings the bell after winning the men's 100 meters final in Paris\n\nRugby players were the first to ring the bell when the Stade de France hosted the Sevens competition before athletics took over at the famous venue\n\nSince the fire, the bells of Notre Dame have rung only twice: for the funeral of former French President Jacques Chirac in 2020 and to commemorate the first anniversary of the fire.\n\n\"In a way, Paris 2024 is helping to rebuild Notre-Dame. Part of the Games and the Olympic spirit will remain in Notre-Dame forever,\" said Stade de France manager Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Lacout.\n\nDuring the rugby tournament, the bell became a photo classic for the winners.\n\nThe French men's team celebrated after winning gold in the men's tournament, with nearly 70,000 fans in attendance.\n\nThe US women's team posed with the bell after winning the bronze medal and also got the chance to ring the bell.\n\nGold medalist Yaroslava Mahuchikh also rang the bell, which will be moved to Notre Dame Cathedral after the Olympics\n\nThe bell had only been rung twice since the devastating fire at Notre Dame in 2019 before athletes like Dominica's Thea Lafond were able to ring it in victory\n\nThe tradition is now carried on by athletes on the track, with only gold medalists having the honor of ringing the bell. Among them are Noah Lyles, the star of the 100-meter sprint, and Yaroslava Mahuchikh, the Ukrainian high jumper.\n\nThe bell was made in Normandy, at the Fonderie Cornille Havard in Villedieu-les-Po\u00eales-Rouffigny.\n\nNotre Dame typically has 10 bells, with the larger historic bells weighing between two and three tons.\n\nOnce the cathedral spire is restored, the Olympic bell will join the smaller bells.\n\nTony Estanguet, head of the Paris 2024 organising committee, praised the ringing of the bells as a way to engage supporters and integrate Parisian culture into each location.\n\n\"It's just for the gold medal winners and it's a great way for them to celebrate,\" Estanguet said.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking

A part of the Games and the Olympic spirit will remain in Notre-Dame for life.\"\n\nThe purpose is for the bell to act as a permanent reminder of the Olympics every time it rings across the city for years to come.\n\nNotre Dame was the victim of a huge fire back in 2019, with its iconic spire collapsing alongside the majority of the cathedral's roof.\n\nSince then, special preparation has been taken to preserve the cathedral and repair it for the future.\n\nSince the fire five years ago, the bells of Notre Dame have only rang twice.\n\nThe first time was for the funeral of former French President, Jacques Chirac, and the second to mark one year since the fire happened.\n\nThe French men's team, who are likely to be more invested in the story of the bell given their more local connection, rang the bell after winning the gold medal in the rugby sevens tournament.\n\nOther teams posed next to it after winning silver and bronze medals, including the American women's team.\n\nAnd in recent days, Ukraine high jump winner Yaroslava Mahuchikh and Noah Lyles have also rang it after securing gold medals.\n\nTony Estanguet, head of the Paris 2024 organising committee,

Please try again later.\n\nPARIS -- When track and field athletes win gold medals or set records, they are directed toward a large silver bell mounted on a metal frame near the stands at Stade de France and asked to ring it.\n\nThey probably won't know the bell was cast at the same foundry as those being made for the reconstruction of Notre Dame. Nor will they realize that after the Olympics and Paralympics, the bell will be placed high inside the cathedral where it will ring during masses when Notre Dame reopens Dec. 8, more than 5\u00bd years after it was nearly destroyed by fire.\n\n\"Notre Dame is definitely with us,\" Leslie Defaux, the head of Paris 2024's sports presentation said. \"Now we are going to set one of the main assets of the Games in Notre Dame's next life.\"\n\nDefaux, who is responsible for adding French touches to each of the competitive sites here, wasn't thinking about Notre Dame originally. She needed something uniquely Parisian to place in one of the Paris Olympics' most prominent venues. A bell, representative of the country's many historic churches, seemed appropriate.\n\nDuring a Google search, she noticed a foundry in Normandy and remembered hearing that many of the bells that were put in Notre Dame's towers earlier this century had been made in Normandy. She liked the idea of having Stad de France's victory bell having similar origins.\n\nWhen she contacted the foundry the Cornille Havard Bell Foundry in the northwestern village of Villedieu Les-Poeles Rouffigny, she discovered it was the same one that had made Notre Dame's bells and was casting new ones for the cathedral's restoration,\n\n\"Then I thought, 'Oh my goodness, they are doing the bells on Notre Dame, and what are we going to do with this bell after the Olympics and Paralympics because we are thinking about the second life of each item we are producing for the Games,\" she said.\n\nShe wondered if Notre Dame might want the bell. But she didn't really know anyone to ask. She had, however, been working with Jules and Gedeon Naudet, the French American brothers whose 2002 documentary \"9/11\" became one of the most vivid accounts of the early hours of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. The Naudets are making Paris 2024's official film. Three years ago they also made a documentary about the fire and restoration of Notre Dame.\n\nThe Naudets put her in touch with Notre Dame's general manager Laurent Prades. She contacted him this past April and said, \"We have a bell. What can we do with it?\"\n\nPrades said he had been looking to add three bells that measured two-feet by two-feet. Would the Paris 2024 bell be that size? These were exactly the dimensions Defaux was considering. After some conversation, Paris 2024 ordered the bell, and it was delivered not long before the Olympics began.\n\nSpeaking this week by teleconference while in his office, Prades said in French through a translator he was surprised when Defaux first called.\n\n\"My first reflection was that this bell is going to ring during prayer services and mass, and that is very different from what is being used as now,\" he said.\n\nBut he also liked the idea.\n\n\"Accepting it for the liturgy after being a sports bell made a lot of sense because 2024 is the year of the Olympics, and it's the year of Notre Dame's reopening and it would mark an event where the world would unite together in Paris and celebrate humanity and togetherness,\" he said. \"It's a symbol of peace and fraternity during the Olympics, which is what Notre Dame is exactly about, also.\"\n\nLaurent said the bell will be one of three that will be placed high in the Cathedral's roof and won't be visible when the Cathedral first reopens. But as Notre Dame returns to normal, he added, there may be a way to put the three bells in a place where people can see them.\n\nThe day after Notre Dame burned, French President Emmanuel Macron said he hoped the cathedral would be rebuilt by the start of the Paris Games. It was an ambitious goal given the amount of work that had to be done, especially with the global pandemic slowing construction. Part of last week's Opening Ceremonies featured a tribute to the workers rebuilding Notre Dame, and the athlete boats passed the cathedral on the Seine, but it has not been a centerpiece in an Olympics that has featured the Eiffel Tower, Grand Palais and Place de la Concorde.\n\nThe bell is a way to pull Notre Dame directly into the Games. The words \"Paris 2024\" are inscribed on the front, without the Olympic rings because the International Olympic Committee does not permit the use of the rings after the Games.\n\nBefore the Olympics, workers installed the bell near the edge of Stad de France's field for the rugby sevens competition. Defaux went to the stadium a few days later and watched as France won its first game. The players ran off the field and over to the bell. Then the began ringing it. As she heard the bell echo throughout the Stad de France she was surprised by the noise.\n\n\"It was super cool and really, I was moved by the moment,\" she said.\n\nLate last week, she was back in the stadium to see workers moving the ball a few feet over for the track and field events. It took eight men (\"eight very strong men,\" she said) to lift the bell.\n\nAfter the Paralympics later this month, a forklift will put the bell on a truck that will take it back to the foundry. There, the bell will be attached to a mount with the other two bells being made for Notre Dame and the set of bells will be sent to the cathedral.\n\n\"And the sound of victory will remain in Notre Dame,\" Defaux said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "les_carpenter@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Les Carpenter", "type":

So did the United States women's rugby sevens team after winning an unprecedented bronze medal.\n\nThe large bell stationed at Stade de France, which hosts track and field events and rugby sevens, has become an instant hit at the 2024 Paris Olympics, with athletes hoping to have their chance to ring in the new Paris tradition after earning a gold medal.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS: Follow USA TODAY's full coverage here\n\nThe bell is engraved with \"2024 Paris,\" and will continue to be a part of the city's history in the time following the 2024 Games.\n\nFans have wondered what the bell's importance is, and why so many Olympic athletes have gravitated toward it after finishing their respective events. The bell has plenty of history, especially going forward.\n\nHere's everything to know about the track and field bell at the 2024 Paris Olympics:\n\nWhy do athletes ring a bell at 2024 Paris Olympics?\n\nThe bell was created ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, and serves a unique purpose moving forward in Paris' history.\n\nThe bell, which was cast in the same forge as the new Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral bells, will be hung up at the renovated Cathedral following the monument's renovations. The cathedral is set to open in December for the first time in over five years after a fire struck one of the world's most well-known monuments.\n\nREQUIRED READING: Olympic track highlights: Noah Lyles is World's Fastest Man in 100 meters photo finish\n\nOne of the bells, which is being stationed at the Olympics, is meant to serve as a time capsule for the world's largest sporting event, according to NBC.\n\n\"In a way, Paris 2024 is helping to rebuild Notre-Dame,\" said Pierre-Andre Lacout, a manager at Stade de France. \"A part of the Games and the Olympic spirit will remain in Notre-Dame for life.\"\n\nThe tradition started at the beginning of the Games, with winners of each rugby sevens match getting a chance to ring the bell. However, only gold medalists can ring the bell after track and field competitions.\n\nThe bell was created at the Fonderie Cornille Havard in Villedieu-les-Poeles-Rouffigny in Normandy, France. The Notre-Dame Cathedral had several bells destroyed in the fire. The Olympic bell will replace one of the two smaller bells used at the cathedral once it reopens.\n\nLeslie Dufaux, the 2024 Paris Games' head of sports presentation, told The Washington Post the idea came from the Games needing something unique to Paris for some of the venues, and with Paris' prominent church scene, a bell seemed like a great idea.\n\nShe then reached out to the foundry in Normandy, which she realized was making the bells for the renovated Notre-Dame.\n\n\"Then I thought: 'Oh my goodness, they are doing the bells on Notre-Dame, and what are we going to do with this bell after the Olympics and Paralympics? Dufaux said. \"Because we are thinking about the second life of each item we are producing for the Games.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Notre-Dame de Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_capsule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time capsule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foundry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/E-mail", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/08/05/PNJM/74674052007-usatsi-23910497.jpg?auto=webp&crop=7402,4164,x0,y387&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790002", "eventUri": "eng-9790002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

I'm the wolf among wolves.\"\n\nThe French men's rugby team won France's first gold medal of the Olympics.\n\nThe team managed to beat Fiji which came as a surprise to some.\n\nFrench coach J\u00e9r\u00f4me Daret said: \"They are the best players in the world and they will remain so.\"\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh won gold for Ukraine in the high jump final.\n\nShe caught the eye of the audience as she wrapped herself up in a sleeping bag between jumps.\n\nShe'd also take sips of an energy drink and even close her eyes for a while.\n\nThea Lafond achieved gold for Dominica in the triple jump.\n\nLafond impressed fans as she achieved a national record jump of 15.02m.\n\nThe win marks a historic first Olympic medal for the Caribbean island nation of Dominica.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_everett@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Charlotte Everett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rugby football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Lyles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noah Lyles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Notre-Dame de Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "100 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaroslava_Mahuchikh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yaroslava Mahuchikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thea_LaFond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thea LaFond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_jump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple jump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/newspress-collage-7kl4wn866-1722851361413.jpg?1722854983&strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790002", "eventUri": "eng-9790002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The likes of Keely Hodgkinson and Armand Duplantis have won gold in the 800m and pole vault respectively and amidst their jubilation were afforded the opportunity to a ring a large bell in the stadium.\n\nLogan is not convinced the chime is entirely authentic however. The former Final Score host believes the noise has rang out before it has been called into action.\n\nSpeaking following Duplantis' effort, Logan told viewers: \"Now, I've noticed this, that the bell starts to ring before the timer actually calls the bell.

The bell is rang following every gold medal in the stadium and has been engraved with '2024 Paris'. It was created ahead of the Olympics but its presence will be maintained well beyond the completion of the event.\n\nThe bell was cast at the Fonderie Cornille Havard in Villedieu-les-Poeles-Rouffigny in Normandy. That is the same forge as the new Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral bells, which will be in place at the newly-renovated monument.\n\nThe cathedral has been closed for five years after it was struck by fire and left in disrepair with several of the bells destroyed in the blaze. Notre-Dame is scheduled to open once again in December after extensive work. The Olympic bell will be put in place at the cathedral at this point.\n\n\"In a way, Paris 2024 is helping to rebuild Notre-Dame,\" said Pierre-Andre Lacout, a Stade de France manager. \"A part of the Games and the Olympic spirit will remain in Notre-Dame for life.\"\n\nFollow all the action on day 11 of the Paris Olympics with Mirror Sport's live blog\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

It's like Santa Claus. Is that what I'm seeing?\"\n\nHowever gold medallist Johnson didn't appear to be convinced and instead joked that Logan was just looking for a reason to go down and ring the bell herself.\n\n\"We will be investigating that, and maybe send you down, Michael,\" she replied.\n\n\"In the name of good journalism I want to make sure that that bell is real!\"\n\nViewers at home weren't too convinced by her theory, with many instead scolding the presenter for revealing that Santa Claus didn't exist on live TV.\n\n\"Hopefully all the kids are in bed before they heard Gabby Logan accidentally reveal Santa Claus isn't real Live on the Telly,\" one person wrote on X.\n\nAnother joked: \"To any kids watching the Olympics tonight, you should know that when Gabby Logan said that the sound of the bell was like Santa Claus, she meant it was 100% real! And done by magic! Now don't ask any more questions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it has been confirmed that the Olympic bell will become part of the Notre-Dame Cathedral renovations following the devastating fire in 2019.\n\nExplaining the reasoning behind the decision, Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Lacout, a manager at the Stade de France, said: \"In a way, Paris 2024 is helping to rebuild Notre-Dame. A part of the Games and the Olympic spirit will remain in Notre-Dame for life.\"", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Logan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gabby Logan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Estanguet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Estanguet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Johnson_(sprinter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Johnson (sprinter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Claus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_vault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pole vault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armand_Duplantis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armand Duplantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Notre-Dame de Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(illusion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magic (illusion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/bltcd74acc1d0a99f3a/blt8d7f46c669f19998/66b2110eecd26b805988604b/olympics-bell-conspiracy-gabby-logan_(1).png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9790002", "eventUri": "eng-9790002", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 1028, "textEnd": 1036}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

It was discovered missing on Monday.\n\nBilas told RNZ: \"The kids all enjoy having their opportunity to ring it to start the day, but it is also a huge part of celebrations and commemorations that we hold here at school.\"\n\nThe school is appealing to the local community in the hope of retrieving the bell.\n\n\"If anyone has seen it, seen someone with it, we just want it back.\n\n\"It's our heart, it's our history. We won't ask any questions.\n\n\"If you find it, please, please bring it back.\"\n\nThe bell is \"about the size of a basketball and very heavy\", with Bilas saying that she thought it was made of brass.\n\nThe school believed the bell was taken to sell for metal.\n\n\"Other schools locally have had brass and copper taken before.\n\n\"To actually take the time to come in in the weekend and take this off our tamariki is hugely upsetting.\"\n\nBilas told chrislynchmedia.com: \"When we went to ring the bell every morning like we do, it just wasn't there. It had been ground off with a power tool. It's like a part of us is missing.\n\n\"The bell is a feature of many school traditions,\" Bilas told Chris Lynch Media.\n\n\"At the end of each year, we gather for every child or staff member who is leaving to ring the bell - rain or shine.\n\n\"The kids then shake hands with all staff and our haka is performed.

However, Gabby, 51, has noticed something amiss with the timing of the bell.\n\nAfter witnessing Sweden's Armand Duplantis enthusiastically ring the bell following his pole-vault gold medal win, she couldn't keep her observations to herself any longer. She believes there's a discrepancy between the timing of the bell and the official timer.\n\nShe shared her thoughts with viewers, saying: \"Now, I've noticed this, that the bell starts to ring before the timer actually calls the bell. I'm hoping, I'm not seeing.. It's like Santa Claus. Is that what I'm seeing? Is this a bit of theatre going on down there?\", she questioned.\n\nBBC pundit and American sprinting legend Michael Johnson teased that Logan simply wanted a turn at ringing the bell herself. In response, the former gymnast said: \"We will be investigating that, and maybe send you down, Michael.\" She continued: \"In the name of good journalism I want to make sure that that bell is real.\"\n\nEvery gold medalist at the Stade de France is given the honour of ringing the bell. Once the Olympics conclude, the bell will be relocated to Notre Dame cathedral.\n\nIt comes after the TV star opened up about her health after dealing with a condition that left her struggling to \"find the right words at the right time\". Gabby was left struggling with her memory, which led her to \"umming a bit\" when on-air. It posed an issue when working for the BBC on events such as the Olympics.\n\nThe reporter's experience of \"brain fog\" turned out to be a common symptom of perimenopause. The condition is often described by women as their mind being filled with \"cotton wool\", as stated by The Menopause Charity when symptoms initially strike.\n\nThe relief came for Gabby once she discovered the reason behind her forgetfulness. To aid her memory, she now has a practice of keeping a piece of paper on-set to jot down names. Speaking to The Telegraph, Gabby said: \"I didn't realise when I first started to experience the symptoms, [and] it was so alien to me to not be able to recall that I was starting to think, 'Oh God, I just can't remember stuff any more'.\n\n\"I was always so good at recall. I got through a law degree basically just by going, 'Ah, page 32, Smith versus Cook'. I was always good with names, finding the right word at the right time, and I'd find myself umming a bit or using 'very, very, very'... Then, when I realised it was a symptom of perimenopause, it was actually a relief, like it normally is when you realise something is part of a process and you can do something about it.\"\n\nFollow

Clang-clong! Clang-CLONG! The swinging bronze bell resonates with each strike of the clapper, filling the small stone tower with an undulating hum. Once Pall\u00e0s finishes his peals, the metallic melody fades to stillness. Silence returns to the tower, giving the valley's soundscape back to the birdsongs and rooster crows.\n\nFor most, church bells are just a quaint bit of automated background noise. But Pall\u00e0s and his 18 students at Vall d'en Bas School of Bell Ringers are trying to change that by resuscitating the dwindling art of tolling -- and communicating -- by hand.\n\nThe shift to mechanical tolling devices over the past century flattened the bells' dynamic songs and muted their messaging powers, said Pall\u00e0s, the school's founder and director. If played with the right know-how, the sounding of church bells in various sequences, tones and rhythms can signal the time for rejoicing or mourning and when to run to the aid of a neighbor in need.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Chicago man gets 103 years for 2020 shooting death of a Bloomington man\n\n\"For centuries, the tolling of church bells was our most important communication method,\" said Pall\u00e0s, standing inside the belfry that doubles as his classroom.\n\n\"Machines cannot reproduce the richness of the sounds that we used to hear, so there has been a simplification and unification of bell ringing,\" he said. \"The language has been lost little by little until now, when we are finally recognizing its worth.\"\n\nBefore newspapers, radio, telephones, television and internet, it was bell ringing that transmitted important information. A physically demanding job that required long hours and complete dedication, to be a bell ringer was to be a human clock and the public loudspeaker.\n\nWhile manual church bell ringing has persisted in Eastern Orthodox countries, it has largely been replaced by bell ringing systems in Catholic and Protestant churches in Western Europe.\n\nMany of Spain's church bell towers that were automized in the 1970s and '80s are in a dire state, said Pall\u00e0s, who witnessed widespread problems while researching the belfries of Garrotxa, a county in northeast Catalonia. The rural area is known for its verdant hills, dormant volcanoes and picturesque villages where most people speak Catalan before Spanish.\n\nHis research included the 12th century Sant Rom\u00e0 church in Joanetes, a tiny village about two hours north of Barcelona, where Pall\u00e0s has spent the past 10 months teaching the inaugural class one Saturday a month.\n\n\"Since the last generation of bell ringers had died off , the only thing to do was to train new ones in how to toll the bells. And that's where the idea of the school was born,\" Pall\u00e0s said.\n\nIntangible heritage\n\nThe initiative comes two years after UNESCO added manual bell ringing in Spain to its compendium of humanity's intangible cultural heritage. UNESCO described how the bells had knitted together communities even before they were functioning modern states.\n\n\"The first thing we have to do is rediscover the bells. That is why this school is so important,\" said Roman Gen\u00e9 Capdevila, president of Catalonia's Bell Ringers brotherhood. \"There are so many ways to ring a bell, what we need are bell ringers.\"\n\nThe bell ringing course, officially recognized by the ISCREB theology school in Barcelona, recently finished with a demonstration by the class. All drawn to the allure of the banging bells, the students were men and women with diverse professional backgrounds ranging from engineering to teaching. One was in his 20s; several were retirees.\n\nThey spent the past few months researching old chiming sequences, documenting their origins and learning to play them. That ethnographic task meant students had to search out old bell ringers, or their family members, to record what they knew.\n\nRoser Sauri jumped at the chance to reconnect with her childhood by recovering and playing the chiming sequence that had sounded in her grandfather's village when he was baptized.\n\n\"The bells formed a part of my life,\" said Sauri, who now works in artificial intelligence. She missed their constancy while studying for her computing doctorate in Boston, where she heard none.\n\n\"When I visited my family, I began to associate the sound of church bells with being back home.\"\n\nThe human touch\n\nThe students took turns tolling sequences for everything from calls to Easter Mass, bad weather warnings, help for fighting a fire to orders for the village militia. They also could tell workers to get back to reaping wheat, or housewives when the fresh fish was coming to market and even how much it cost. Many of the ringers wore earplugs or headphones to muffle the deafening peals.\n\nThe students tolled a gamut of death announcements that could specify gender and social class. Juan Carles Osuna and two others tolled for the death of a woman. That meant swinging the largest bell at 945 pounds. It still had a clapper secured in the traditional method of using the dried skin of an ox penis.\n\nOsuna, who paints church murals, also performed a complex sequence with all four of the belfry's bells that required him to sit in a chair with ropes looped around his hands and feet.\n\n\"Whew! It's an emotional experience. You feel your blood pumping. You feel the strength, and how you are communicating with everyone in earshot,\" he said. \"For me it is an honor, it's a way to honor both humans and God.\"\n\nThe hesitation, the variation in the strength of each toll: in these details, and sometimes mistakes, the listener can hear the creator of the sound.\n\n\"The (automated) hammer will always be mathematically precise,\" Osuna said. \"There is emotion in the human touch. There is a human element.\"\n\nPall\u00e0s believes that a recovery of bell ringing in a neighborhood or town's life could help strengthen communities in this dizzying age of technological, economic and political change.\n\n\"This is a means of communication that reaches everyone inside a local community and can help it come together at concrete moments,\" Pall\u00e0s said. \"That can include a death in the community or the celebration of a holiday. It can help mark the rituals that we need.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campanology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Campanology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_bell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Church bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bell tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Salvation_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Salvation Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

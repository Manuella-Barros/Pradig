A source claimed, however, that the pics in question were \u201creadily accessible\u201d online. The source also alleged that the Moore\u2019s racy photo display came after Eady had allegedly made threats of violence to the \u201cRHOA\u201d veteran leading up to the hair spa event. The insider claimed to Page Six that Eady previously confronted Moore using the word \u201cgun,\u201d which made the cast feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d Multiple sources, including a production source, also confirmed that the alleged \u201cgun\u201d threat was never made at Moore\u2019s party. However, the production insider insisted there had never been a weapon on set. Eady also disputed ever making any such threats in her Instagram Story post. \u201cFor the record, I\u2019ve never once had possession of any weapons or threatened anyone ever,\u201d the \u201cRHOA\u201d newbie clarified. \u201cI\u2019ve never been to jail, in fight, or even had as much as a speeding ticket. That\u2019s not my character.\u201d Eady then concluded, \u201cI am hurt by the narrative that\u2019s being displayed. Wrong is wrong.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what sparked a feud between the two Bravolebrities to begin with, but cameras have been rolling for Season 16, capturing several of these interactions. It\u2019s unknown, however, whether the party where the risqu\u00e9 images of Eady were shown will air. A source told us Friday that Bravo has allegedly launched an investigation into the incident. Season 16 is meant to revive \u201cRHOA\u201d since it reportedly saw ratings slump the past few seasons. Producers even considered rebooting the entire franchise last year, but ultimately ended up bringing back former cast members who had left the series to help revamp the show. In February, Porsha Williams confirmed she had signed on to be a \u201cHousewife\u201d again and Cynthia Bailey accepted a \u201cfriend of\u201d role after leaving the reality series in 2021.", "summary": "The \"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" veteran and reality TV newbie have been feuding while filming Season 16 of the Bravo series.", "url": "https://pagesix.com/2024/06/08/entertainment/rhoa-stars-kenya-moore-brittany-eady-react-to-explicit-photos-alleged-gun-threat-scandal/", "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/83471850.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/V6XubSx6-guILbWnz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:39:36", "author": "Eileen Reslen", "authors": ["Eileen Reslen"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.204}

Countless Brits will be looking forward to a bit of sunshine over the bank holiday, and there's no better way to spend the day than having BBQs or sunbathing in the park. However, it's essential to keep ourselves protected from the sun, as forgetting to do so can lead to serious health consequences, including sunburn, aging, and even skin cancer. We should all avoid some common mistakes when it comes to applying SPF, and make sure we're slathering on the right quantity of product anywhere on our bodies to prevent any issues. The World Health Organisation advises people apply a thin layer of sun cream to their skin, equal to the amount of liquid in a teaspoon, and reapply it regularly throughout the day. Some people might skip sunscreen when gardening or exercising outdoors and believe that on cloudy or overcast days, SPF isn't necessary. However, you can still get burnt, so it's important to use it regardless of the weather. Experts also recommend you check the label on your sun cream to see if it's out-of-date. Sunscreen typically only lasts one to two years after opening, and if you keep it for longer, it might not protect you as well as you think. Medications can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Professor Claire Anderson, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, has said: \"Quite a few medicines can make you more photosensitive, including common drugs such as antibiotics, oral contraceptives, and antidepressants \u2013 but not everyone who takes them will have a reaction.\" Niamh McMillan, a Superdrug Pharmacy Superintendent, also suggests we think carefully about when to apply sun protectant, as doing this too early or too late can increase the risk of skin damage. \"It's best to apply sunscreen 15 - 30 minutes before going outside,\" she explained. It should then be reapplied to exposed areas, 15 \u2013 30 minutes after sun exposure. People should always try to reapply sunscreen after vigorous activity such as swimming or excessive sweating, that could remove the sunscreen.\" Do you have a story to sell?

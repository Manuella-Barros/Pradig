(Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images) Getty Images Come Belmont Stakes race day, the chips of any Triple Crown season have not quite all fallen, but most have, and with today\u2019s field as densely shot through with talent as it is \u2014 both known and unknown, it must be said \u2014 fates will be decided. Even at a Derby length of a mile-and-a-quarter as today\u2019s very unusual 156th running at Saratoga will be, the Belmont will be a decider. Call it what you will, a bookend, a great shunt, a fork in the road, the Belmont traditionally moves its contenders onto different paths, some to shorter careers directed toward the stud barns, others remaining on the tracks as they move through Saratoga\u2019s own Travers Stakes to the Breeders\u2019 Cup landscape and beyond. Thus the careers of the Belmont\u2019s four top favorites are put into play today. Of the four, Derby winner Mystik Dan and underdog Seize the Grey clearly have their work cut out for them. The remarkable thing about Seize the Grey\u2019 Preakness win is that he didn\u2019t just lollygag around and happen to appear at the finish line to mop up because no other athlete could manage the run \u2014 he actually got out there and won his Preakness. By contrast, Mystik Dan had more than a bit of good fortune come his way in the Derby. Did we mention that Mystik Dan\u2019s connections have had some fine \u201ctour jackets\u201d run up to beat back the Adirondacks\u2019 morning-workout chill up at Saratoga?

Mindframe, (7/2) (Source: NYRA, June 7, 2024) But before any of those big-career-picture questions can be settled for any of today\u2019s ten athletes, everybody in the race today must confront the race\u2019s first and most pressing question, namely, who the heck is Mindframe and what\u2019s he gonna do? Not even his trainer, Todd Pletcher, knows the answer to that, although the talented Texas-born horsesman probably has a better idea than anybody else. In Mindframe\u2019s microscopically short two-race career, the athlete has left some speedy hints along the way. He walks to the track at post time today with the highest Beyer figure \u2014 103 \u2014 of any of his more experienced competitors. So, we know he likes to run fast, and he (probably) has a fair idea of the general architecture of a race, if not, exactly, a specific, tactical one. Put another way, he does seem to know and to live by the maxim that, when on a track competing with other horses, it\u2019s a really good idea to beat everybody in sight. The corollary to that is, we could fairly say that his tactical awareness in the teeth of a race approaches zero even as his speed figures top north of a hundred. Which is why, in a race that is likely to be highly tactical as this field promises this Belmont Stakes to be, Pletcher has Irad Ortiz Jr. in the irons, arguably one of international flat racing\u2019s top four tacticians, another of whom is Ortiz\u2019 brother. Young horses, especially young Thoroughbreds who have not raced much, can\u2019t be told to \u201cunthink\u201d what they think they should do in competition. They can be ridden, of course, and given certain sorts of tack to help them focus on the task of addressing a level of tactical need with a tactical performance. But, as the best trainers know, they can\u2019t really be changed. What they can be is polished and prepared to be the best versions of themselves.

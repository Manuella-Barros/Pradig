Jenny Toole, from Radcliffe, tipped the scales at 21st when she decided to turn her life around for good. The mum knew she had to make major changes when she was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia just before Christmas 2022, where part of the stomach bulges into the chest. The 32-year-old, who cares for her young son Kristian, watched as the weight quickly dropped off through eating healthier and exercising.

Elizabeth Grundy, from Wythenshawe, was among just four children in the world known to have been diagnosed both neuroblastoma and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) when she was a baby - odds of one in two billion. The tot was just 10-days-old when she started undergoing chemotherapy, operations and transfusions. She also developed meningitis and sepsis and was left deaf in both ears. But her family were dealt another blow when she developed a limp and was diagnosed with leukaemia in May 2022. Now a wheelchair-user, Elizabeth is in the maintenance phase of the illness and her family hope she will be given the all-clear at the end of this year. Thankfully, she is now in remission for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Jenny raised money for the family by losing enough weight to take part in the Bury 10k in 2023. Having shed a further two and a half stone, she's now set to take part in the Great Manchester Half Marathon on May 26. \"I realised I need to lose weight once and for all \u2013 for myself and for my son,\" the mum said. \"I didn\u2019t follow a specific diet plan but simply cut out loads of things, eat a high protein diet and keep a close eye on calories, carbs and fats. \"In April 2023, I started running and joined a gym, where I have a fantastic personal trainer. I decided to sign up to the Bury 10K to give me more motivation but also to help Elizabeth, who is an amazing child \u2013 no one should have to go through everything she\u2019s gone through, especially at such a young age. She\u2019s the bravest child I\u2019ve ever met. \"Since then, I\u2019ve become addicted to running and done eight more 10K races with a personal best time of 51 minutes. This will be my tenth race but my first half marathon, and I\u2019m delighted to be supporting Elizabeth with it again.\" With neuroblastoma carrying an 80 per cent chance of relapse, Elizabeth's family are now raising funds to allow her to take part in a potentially life-saving trial. Mum Chelsea said: \"Initially we thought we needed to raise \u00a3127,000 for treatment in America. It\u2019s now possible that there will be a UK trial, though it\u2019s not definite and even if it happens, there will still be costs involved. \"Elizabeth has a lot to deal with but she\u2019s also a superhero who loves swimming, drawing and being outside, and we want to give her the best chance possible. The family is being supported by children\u2019s charity Tree of Hope, a charity which helps families fundraise for children with healthcare needs where the NHS can\u2019t support. It provides charity status to benefit from gift aid, corporate support whilst also providing donor reassurance. Tree of Hope CEO, Becky Andrew, said: \"We are delighted to be supporting the Carter family with their fundraising and wish Jenny the best of luck with the Great Manchester Run.\"", "summary": "Jenny Toole looks unrecognisable after shedding half of her body weight", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/mum-inspired-lose-10-half-29176250", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29177665.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jen-before-and-after-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:00:46", "author": "Paige Oldfield", "authors": ["Paige Oldfield"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.064}

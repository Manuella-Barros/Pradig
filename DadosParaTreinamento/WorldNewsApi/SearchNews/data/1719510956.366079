Simmons and Michelle Schumacher\u2019s daughter Olivia has followed her parents into show business, but it wasn\u2019t something they encouraged when she was younger. \u201cGrowing up in L.A. she had classmates, kids who were embarking on careers when they're 12 or 5 or whatever,\u201d Simmons, 69, tells PEOPLE. \u201cMichelle and I both knew that it just wasn't our vibe to be taking her out on professional auditions when she was in seventh grade.\u201d Nevertheless, Olivia, 22 \u2014 who stars with her Oscar-winning dad, 69, in the new movie You Can\u2019t Run Forever, which is co-written and directed by Schumacher, 57 \u2014 was interested in moviemaking. \u201cI grew up visiting them both on sets and stuff, and I always was so excited whenever I got to do that,\u201d recalls Olivia, who became seriously interested when she was in middle school. \u201cWhen she announced it as a serious life goal of hers, it was sort of coincidental with all of the attention I was getting for Whiplash,\u201d says Simmons, who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 2015 for playing an abusive music teacher in the drama starring Miles Teller. \u201cWe were a little concerned that she thought being an actor meant being on a red carpet and somebody handing you a trophy all the time,\u201d he continues. Olivia remembers their hesitation. \u201cThey actually didn't want me to be an actor for a while because they both know how hard it is, and they didn't want me to think that it would just be this automatic easy thing,\u201d she says. Simmons says his daughter has the \u201cgene\u201d for acting, but also encouraged her to make sure she\u2019s doing what she loves.

The job of an actor \u201cis attention-seeking,\u201d says Olivia. \u201cSo that's something that you kind of have to combat, and you have to know that you're doing it for the right reasons and not doing it for fame or for attention, and just doing it because you love it so much.\u201d She\u2019s not the only child pursuing her passion. The couple\u2019s son, Joe, 25, is a musician and composer who did the music for You Can\u2019t Run Forever, a thriller about a man (Simmons) who snaps and goes on a killing spree. He started playing piano when he was 6 and eventually became proficient on other instruments, like the electric bass. The New York University graduate began writing music as a teenager, and his mom took notice. When she was making the 2017 movie I\u2019m Not Here (also featuring Simmons and, in a minor role, Olivia), she enlisted him to write a piano piece that\u2019s featured in the movie. \u201cHe was still in high school,\u201d recalls Schumacher. \u201cOvernight he wrote the piece. He\u2019s like, \u2018Okay, here. I got to do my homework.\u2019 \u201d For Joe, it was an eye-opening moment: \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, this is fun. I love writing music. And I could get paid.\u2019 \u201d You Can't Run Forever is in select theaters and available on demand now. For more on J.K.

This includes running lead on the Met Gala, which is among PEOPLE.com's top-trafficked red carpet events every year, interviewing the industry's top influencers (including all the Kardashian-Jenners), and breaking A-list celeb news (a New Jersey shore native, it is no surprise that her favorite interview ever was with Bruce Springsteen). Brittany is a style contributor to People Every Day Podcast and has represented the brand on national TV programs including Good Morning America and The CW's two TV specials on the British Royals. She joined PEOPLE from Cosmopolitan in 2013, where she was an Associate Editor.\n\nWhen Olivia Culpo began planning her wedding wardrobe, she followed the advice of so many brides before her: trust your gut.\n\nFor the former Miss Universe, that meant one thing: \"I wanted to feel like myself in every sense of the word,\" she tells PEOPLE in the first interview since her June 29 Rhode Island wedding to San Francisco 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey. \"And I think that that's where my decision to be more pared down came in.\"\n\nHer vision came to life in the form of a conservative, long-sleeve Dolce & Gabbana wedding dress, because as she told Vogue ahead of her big day, she \"didn't want it to exude sex in any way, shape or form.\"\n\nThe look and her explanation behind it ignited a fashion firestorm on social media with deep-dive dissertations dissecting every detail of the gown and her glam. The verified account gowneyedgirl, run by Los Angeles-based stylist Kennedy Bingham, questioned Culpo's choice of such a covered-up dress saying the \"way that she was talking about this went beyond just wanting something modest for herself and pushing this idea of what she thinks all brides should look like\" -- comments which prompted both Culpo and McCaffrey to respond.\n\nEven Jenna Bush Hager and Hoda Kotb dedicated a segment during their Today hour in defense of Culpo, sharing, \"We think she looks beautiful\" and questioning, \"Why does anybody feel like they get to comment on how she's dressed?\"\n\nNow, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model and fashion influencer is responding to the bridal backlash for the first time.\n\n\"I was definitely very surprised,\" Culpo tells PEOPLE. \"I feel like I personally like to give people the benefit of the doubt. And unfortunately, I feel like the words I said were spun out of context to fit an agenda that I did not have.\"\n\n\"I loved every part of my wedding because I love my husband and the people we got to celebrate that day with,\" she adds. \"The choices that I made are because I wanted to feel like they're choices I could be proud of in 50 years. And that's it.\"\n\nShe paired the crepe ball gown, which featured a crew neck, long sleeves and buttons down the back and arms, with a 16-foot-long lace veil, as well as minimal makeup, even revealing that she skipped mascara. The traditional design was one of three Dolce & Gabbana looks the Italian fashion house custom made for the star.\n\n\"Stylistically I had a vision. Stylistically, I felt like I was making a decision that was going to stand the test of time, and that's it,\" she doubles down in defense of the ceremony gown, adding, \"I felt very comfortable in it, for what it's worth. I was on the water and there was a very nice breeze.\"\n\nWith a career originating in pageants and evolving into the fashion arena, Culpo also points out that she's worn \"every\" style of dress, adding that her ceremony gown was \"surprisingly not too heavy.\"\n\nShe says the evolution of each dress in her bridal wardrobe created \"a story that reflects each part of the person that I am.\"\n\n\"The first one felt so special to me -- the simplicity of everything made it feel timeless and classic and traditional,\" she shares. \"The second dress I felt was ethereal and romantic, and the last dress was fun and playful. I liked the way that the three balanced each other.\"\n\nThe biggest piece of advice Culpo would share with future brides is \"stay true to yourself.\"\n\n\"Stick to the vision you have in your head and don't worry about anything else,\" she says. \"No matter what you wear, no matter what your decisions are from your makeup to your hair, to the gown, you will look absolutely beautiful because it's a beautiful day.\"\n\nCulpo reveals that she and McCaffrey saw each other for the first time as she was walking down the aisle.\n\n\"He was beaming and very emotional,\" she says. \"I was so shaky. It was really special -- and I know it's a moment that we'll both have imprinted in our memories forever.\"\n\nAnother moment she'll hold close is the private mini cocktail hour she had with the groom right after the ceremony.\n\n\"We had our own bottle of Champagne. We had everything that the guests were eating downstairs, but we had a moment to really regroup and take in the moment as newlyweds, having just had our very intimate ceremony,\" Culpo says. \"And I would recommend that if a bride and groom can take those moments away, it's really special.\"\n\nNow that Culpo is settling into married life, she wants to share her passion for party planning and decor with other newlyweds.\n\nThat's why she partnered with Crate & Barrel to curate some of her registry favorites.\n\n\"I wanted to help brides and newlyweds in their planning process, because I know how stressful that whole process can be,\" she says. \"Crate & Barrel really takes out the guesswork by making it a one-stop shop for the whole home. There's really something for every need that you have, and they make it so seamless.\"\n\nMost of her picks revolve around versatile kitchen essentials and timeless decor, much like the pieces seen at her wedding.\n\n\"Our favorite thing to do together is cook,\" Culpo says. \"It's one of our absolute favorite date-night activities. Work for me is leaving the house and getting dressed. Our idea of a really nice date is not necessarily going out and getting dressed up. It's staying home and cooking in sweatpants.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Culpo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Culpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CW", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The CW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_McCaffrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian McCaffrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Shore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jersey Shore"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitan_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosmopolitan (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolce_&_Gabbana", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dolce & Gabbana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Springsteen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miss Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_dress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wedding dress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_special", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vogue (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glam_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glam rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenna_Bush_Hager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jenna Bush Hager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_gown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ball gown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoda_Kotb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hoda Kotb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated_Swimsuit_Issue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The verified account gowneyedgirl, run by Los Angeles-based stylist Kennedy Bingham, questioned Culpo's choice of such a covered-up dress saying the \"way that she was talking about this went beyond just wanting something modest for herself and pushing this idea of what she thinks all brides should look like\" -- comments which prompted both Culpo and McCaffrey to respond.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Olivia Frances Culpo (@oliviaculpo)\n\nEven Jenna Bush Hager and Hoda Kotb dedicated a segment during their Today hour in defense of Culpo, sharing, \"We think she looks beautiful\" and questioning, \"Why does anybody feel like they get to comment on how she's dressed?\"\n\nNow, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model and fashion influencer is responding to the bridal backlash for the first time.\n\n\"I was definitely very surprised,\" Culpo tells PEOPLE. \"I feel like I personally like to give people the benefit of the doubt. And unfortunately, I feel like the words I said were spun out of context to fit an agenda that I did not have.\"\n\n\"I loved every part of my wedding because I love my husband and the people we got to celebrate that day with,\" she adds. \"The choices that I made are because I wanted to feel like they're choices I could be proud of in 50 years.

Stylistically, I felt like I was making a decision that was going to stand the test of time, and that's it,\" she doubles down in defense of the ceremony gown, adding, \"I felt very comfortable in it, for what it's worth. I was on the water and there was a very nice breeze.\"\n\nWith a career originating in pageants and evolving into the fashion arena, Culpo also points out that she's worn \"every\" style of dress, adding that her ceremony gown was \"surprisingly not too heavy.\"\n\nShe says the evolution of each dress in her bridal wardrobe created \"a story that reflects each part of the person that I am.\"\n\n\"The first one felt so special to me -- the simplicity of everything made it feel timeless and classic and traditional,\" she shares. \"The second dress I felt was ethereal and romantic, and the last dress was fun and playful.

It was really special -- and I know it's a moment that we'll both have imprinted in our memories forever.\"\n\nAnother moment she'll hold close is the private mini cocktail hour she had with the groom right after the ceremony.\n\n\"We had our own bottle of Champagne. We had everything that the guests were eating downstairs, but we had a moment to really regroup and take in the moment as newlyweds, having just had our very intimate ceremony,\" Culpo says. \"And I would recommend that if a bride and groom can take those moments away, it's really special.\"\n\nNow that Culpo is settling into married life, she wants to share her passion for party planning and decor with other newlyweds.\n\nThat's why she partnered with Crate & Barrel to curate some of her registry favorites.\n\n\"I wanted to help brides and newlyweds in their planning process, because I know how stressful that whole process can be,\" she says. \"Crate & Barrel really takes out the guesswork by making it a one-stop shop for the whole home.

Some were thrilled to hear the model had chosen a more modest dress, others were appalled.\n\nCulpo and McCaffrey found the hate unsettling, calling out specific users on social media.\n\nOLIVIA CULPO INSISTED THAT HER WEDDING DRESS NOT 'EXUDE SEX IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM'\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU'RE READING?

And unfortunately, I feel like the words I said were spun out of context to fit an agenda that I did not have.\"\n\n\"I wanted to feel like myself in every sense of the word,\" she reiterated of her original message she gave to Vogue last month. \"And I think that that's where my decision to be more pared down came in.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\n\"Stylistically I had a vision.

I hope you can find joy and peace in the world, the way my beautiful wife does,\" he commented on the Instagram reel.\n\nBingham added that while she did not have a problem with the \"simple, elegant\" dress, she believed the gown had \"no personality.\" She captioned the video, \"From Miss Universe to Miss Pick Me, Olivia Culpo is earning her crown.\"\n\nCulpo later chimed in in the comment section on TikTok, calling Bingham a \"bizarre human.\"\n\nShe and McCaffrey married at the Watch Hill Chapel in Westerly, Rhode Island, with a reception held at the Ocean House.\n\n\"I felt very comfortable in it, for what it's worth. I was on the water and there was a very nice breeze.\"\n\n-- Olivia Culpo on her wedding dress\n\nCulpo worked directly with Dolce & Gabbana to create not only her wedding dress, but also the welcome party, reception and after-party dresses. \"That's what made me even more excited about this vision,\" she explained to Vogue of working with their atelier. \"It's a covenant. It's the beginning of the rest of your life - and it's the union and bond of two people forever,\" she noted. \"I wanted something that felt as serious as that commitment,\" she said of her wedding gown.\n\nThe former Miss Universe also opted to wear minimal makeup for the ceremony, skipping mascara and eyebrow gel to ensure a more natural look.\n\n\"I wanted it to feel effortless and as if it's complimenting me, not overpowering me. There's so much beauty and simplicity,\" she said of the dress, a long-sleeve ballgown with minimal embellishments. She also wore a 16-foot veil.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDespite the hubbub, Culpo says her wedding was great because she did it the way she wanted.\n\n\"I loved every part of my wedding because I love my husband and the people we got to celebrate that day with,\" she continued. \"The choices that I made are because I wanted to feel like they're choices I could be proud of in 50 years.

But one of the happiest days of her life soon turned into a nightmare as she got ripped apart online over everything from her makeup to even her wedding dress. For the big day, Olivia wore a white, long-sleeved gown from Dolce & Gabbana. She told Vogue ahead of her nuptials that she \"didn't want it to exude sex in any way, shape or form\" when she walked down the aisle and wanted something that \"felt as serious\" as the commitment of marriage. Check it out (below):\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Olivia Frances Culpo (@oliviaculpo)\n\nRelated: Aurora Culpo SLAMS Bethenny Frankel For Leaking The Paul Bernon Split News!\n\nWhile the 32-year-old model was going for \"beauty and simplicity\" with her look, social media users had a lot of other words to describe it. Many took offense to her remarks, blasting the patriarchal message behind it. Fashion influencer Kennedy Bingham, specifically, claimed on TikTok that the way Olivia talked about the dress \"went beyond just wanting something modest for herself and pushing this idea of what she thinks all brides should look like.\" She also slammed the bride's gown for giving \"nothing,\" lacking \"personality,\" and being designed by a brand with a history of racism, homophobia, and body shaming.\n\nDamn!\n\nOlivia and her hubby fired back at Kennedy, saying her comments were \"evil\" and \"extremely hurtful.\" No matter what the couple said, though, the criticism didn't stop! TikToker Jess Weslie then said Olivia had \"pick me\" and \"weird\" vibes -- just because she spoke about keeping her makeup natural for the wedding in Vogue. Oh, and that was not all. She and Christian also got blasted by his former Panthers teammate Cam Newton for not inviting him! Jeez.\n\nAs we said, her wedding got trashed left and right! But beyond defending herself in the comments, Olivia has not spoken out about the backlash. Until now! She reacted to the whole debacle for the first time in an interview with People on Thursday, saying:\n\n\"I wanted to feel like myself in every sense of the word. And I think that that's where my decision to be more pared down came in.\"\n\nWhen Olivia started to get slammed online about her look, it came as a complete shock to her! She expressed:\n\n\"I was definitely very surprised. I feel like I personally like to give people the benefit of the doubt. And unfortunately, I feel like the words I said were spun out of context to fit an agenda that I did not have. I loved every part of my wedding because I love my husband and the people we got to celebrate that day with. The choices that I made are because I wanted to feel like they're choices I could be proud of in 50 years. And that's it.\"\n\nDespite what criticisms some have, she loved her dress at the end of the day. Olivia continued:\n\n\"Stylistically I had a vision. Stylistically, I felt like I was making a decision that was going to stand the test of time, and that's it. I felt very comfortable in it, for what it's worth. I was on the water and there was a very nice breeze.\"\n\nThe reality star also made it clear she went for a look that she wanted and wasn't trying to push the idea of what other brides should look like. Ultimately, she just feels all women should \"stay true to\" themselves when looking for a dress for their wedding:\n\n\"Stick to the vision you have in your head and don't worry about anything else. No matter what you wear, no matter what your decisions are from your makeup to your hair, to the gown. You will look absolutely beautiful because it's a beautiful day.\"\n\nIt sounds like Olivia isn't letting all the backlash ruin her special day -- not anymore, at least!

'I hope you can find joy and peace in the world, the way my beautiful wife does.'\n\nHowever, Bingham responded to the sports star and typed, '@christianmccaffrey So what's evil is pointing out the potential internalized misogyny behind her reasoning...'\n\n'Your (imo) patriarchal comment, and the racist/ homophobic/fatphobic history of the designers she worked with?'\n\nIn the comment section of the same reel uploaded to the influencer's TikTok page, Olivia herself shared her thoughts, also clapping back at Kennedy's criticism.\n\n'Wow what an absolutely evil person you are. I hope no one ever tears you apart in this way because it's extremely hurtful.

But I do not like this wedding dress.'\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Vogue Weddings (@vogueweddings)\n\nShe previously said of the gown: 'I didn't want it to exude sex in any way, shape or form'\n\nShe explained that if she were just looking at the dress, 'I would see a beautiful bride and a beautiful, simple, elegant dress.'\n\nHowever, Bingham added, 'But it's the stuff surrounding the dress that leaves kind of a bitter after taste.'\n\nKennedy then referenced to Olivia's recent interview with Vogue where she talked about the wedding gown, and explained she 'didn't want it to exude sex in any way, shape, or form.'\n\n'There is nothing wrong with wanting a modest wedding dress, or just modest attire in general,' she continued, but then added Culpo 'pushed this idea of what she thinks all brides should look like.'\n\n'...So to treat this as a sexless design is really odd to me because both, it is your choice if you do not want to exude sex in this gown, but also if people want to sexualize you, it is not your fault if they do that.'\n\n'Her two statements next to each other are a very eloquent way of saying you are asking for whatever you are dressed as, which is an extremely harmful way of thinking.'\n\nEarlier this month McCaffrey came to the defense of his wife after a style influencer labeled her Dolce & Gabbana wedding dress as 'nothing' and the 'absence of personality'\n\n'Wow what an absolutely evil person you are. I hope no one ever tears you apart in this way because it's extremely hurtful. I love this dress and it was everything I ever wanted and more,' the model penned\n\n'There is nothing wrong with wanting a modest wedding dress, or just modest attire in general,' she continued, but then added Culpo 'pushed this idea of what she thinks all brides should look like'\n\nBingham then said she felt it was 'weird' how Culpo 'talks about coverage, especially as someone in her day-to-day life is someone who is not exactly a modest dresser.'\n\n'She even says her husband thinks she's the most beautiful when she is timeless, covered and elegant. I just think the usage of the word \"covered\" is so icky because you are not covered in day-to-day life.'\n\n'And also why is he thinking that you are the most beautiful when you are covered? That's just such an odd thing,' Kennedy said.\n\nShe also said it was 'odd' for Culpo to market a 'conservative agenda' and began to direct attention back to the wedding gown.\n\n'There is no personality in this dress,' and added, 'This is just nothing. It is the absence of personality.\n\nIn conclusion, Kennedy said, 'It's very clear this was not a wedding. This was a conservative campaign, and it wasn't even well done...'\n\nWhile talking with Vogue, Olivia opened up about her nuptials as well as her wedding gown designed by Italian brand, Dolce & Gabbana. 'I had a very clear idea of what I wanted for my ceremony dress.'\n\n'I have worked with Dolce & Gabbana for years, so it was incredibly special to collaborate with Stefano [Gabbana], Domenico [Dolce], and the exceptional design and atelier team.'\n\nThe crepe ball gown contained long sleeves, a full skirt, a train and also a row of buttons on the back that secured the dress.\n\nA 16-foot sheer veil was added on top of her head to complete the look and had an embroidered, lace trim.\n\n'I didn't want it to exude sex in any way, shape, or form,' Culpo said of the wedding dress. 'I wanted it to feel effortless and as if it's complementing me, not overpowering me.

This includes running lead on the Met Gala, which is among PEOPLE.com's top-trafficked red carpet events every year, interviewing the industry's top influencers (including all the Kardashian-Jenners), and breaking A-list celeb news (a New Jersey shore native, it is no surprise that her favorite interview ever was with Bruce Springsteen). Brittany is a style contributor to People Every Day Podcast and has represented the brand on national TV programs including Good Morning America and The CW's two TV specials on the British Royals. She joined PEOPLE from Cosmopolitan in 2013, where she was an Associate Editor.\n\nOlivia Culpo and Christian McCaffrey's ideal date night is happening right in their kitchen.\n\n\"Our favorite thing to do together is cook,\" Culpo tells PEOPLE exclusively following the couple's picturesque Rhode Island wedding on June 29. \"It's one of our absolute favorite date-night activities. Work for me is leaving the house and getting dressed. Our idea of a really nice date is not necessarily going out and getting dressed up. It's staying home and cooking in sweatpants.\"\n\nSo of course most of the fashion influencer and NFL pro's wedding registry was packed with versatile pieces they use every day, which is why the former Miss Universe is partnering with Crate & Barrel to curate some of her registry favorites for busy brides.\n\n\"I wanted to help brides and newlyweds in their planning process, because I know how stressful that whole process can be,\" she tells PEOPLE. \"Crate & Barrel really takes out the guesswork by making it a one-stop shop for the whole home. There's really something for every need that you have, and they make it so seamless.\"\n\nBelow, shop Culpo's top Crate & Barrel picks.\n\n\"I am obsessed with Le Creuset and the dutch oven in particular was number one on my registry. It's definitely a heritage piece. You can pass that down to your kids. It's an investment, but it stands the test of time. Plus, it's just such a versatile piece that you can make so many dishes in. I love to bake bread in it. I got really into making sourdough bread this year. It's wild. I found myself up at night at 1 a.m. in bed watching YouTubes of bread. Hour-long videos. I'm like, 'What is wrong with me?'\"\n\n\"Again, this piece so versatile. The KitchenAid stand mixer is great for obviously baked goods, but also there's so many different attachments from spiralizers to meat grinders to pasta makers. It's a very versatile piece of equipment that you'll have for your entire life.\n\n\"I'm obsessed with glassware. These long-stem wine glasses are absolutely stunning, and I get so many compliments on them.\"\n\n\"Crate and Barrel has the most elevated home pieces, like this vase, which is classic and timeless.\"\n\n\"One thing that Christian is obsessed with that I selected is the towel warmer. It's not the first thing you would think someone would choose, but honestly, it was one of the first things I knew I wanted to put on a registry. It's so nice having a warm towel coming out of the shower. It's the simple things in life, but definitely one of our favorites.\"\n\n\"This is made of beautiful crystal, and it's great for entertaining. I've also been using it all summer, just in my kitchen for lemon water with fresh lemons from the garden. It looks great, but also it's elevated.\n\n\"This is just a great thing to have because it's great for a group and for entertaining. It's fun, the pizza tastes amazing, and it's easy to use.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brittany"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crate_&_Barrel", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crate & Barrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Culpo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Culpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CW", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The CW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmopolitan_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cosmopolitan (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Met_Gala", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Met Gala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Springsteen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Springsteen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_carpet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red carpet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Good Morning America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Creuset", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Le Creuset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_oven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dutch oven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miss Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bread"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixer_(appliance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixer (appliance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KitchenAid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KitchenAid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sourdough", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sourdough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat_grinder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meat grinder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pizza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lemon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pasta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glass"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/k6cr614eX9nGnFtJs7l1K9fWYpg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/christian-mccaffrey-olivia-culpo-6th-annual-best-buddies-celebration-of-mothers-020924-1-8b1265c8c8194b8390dc825bc8935d97.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9763741", "eventUri": "eng-9763741", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 966, "textEnd": 973}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

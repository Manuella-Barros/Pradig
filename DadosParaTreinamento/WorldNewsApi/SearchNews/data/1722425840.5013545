It\u2019s another to actually empower women. Businesses with savvy advertising teams know that all too well, and often bank on the naivet\u00e9 of their audiences as an excuse to talk the talk without walking the walk. Boutique women\u2019s running brand Oiselle doesn\u2019t take shortcuts, though. Maybe doing so would have resulted in just as many sales without nearly as much effort. But Oiselle would rather earn the trust of the running community than scheme for it. The brand has committed to playing the long game, building up a steadfast audience over its 17 years in business by treating their clothing as a means to an end. Oiselle designs apparel for women who have more on their minds than their training plan. From that perspective, clothes become tools for performance\u2014not just aesthetics. Oiselle commits to empowering women who run. Illustration: Forbes / Photo: Oiselle Women who wear Oiselle learn to think about running differently as a result. They accomplish more on the big stage because they feel capable of doing more behind the scenes. And most importantly, they see running as an integral part of life instead of an escape from it. Oiselle allows women to bring their whole selves to each run. As a busy runner who squeezes training sessions into every spare window of opportunity, I tested some of Oiselle\u2019s fan favorites to see if they could streamline my schedule. A few key design details have had a noticeable impact on how wisely I can use my time. The sense of safety, comfort and ease that I get from wearing Oiselle apparel translates to faster paces and fewer interruptions. That\u2019s all thanks to the purpose behind the product. Here\u2019s how Oiselle helps women like me strengthen their relationship with running for the sake of enjoyment and performance. MORE FROMFORBES VETTED Casper Vs. Nectar: Which Popular Foam Mattress Suits You Better? By Brooke Williams Contributor The Best Wayfair Outdoor Furniture Deals To Shop This Weekend By Alexandra Polk Contributor Show Up To Stand Out Talent isn\u2019t everything. Even athletes with so-called \u201cnatural talent\u201d can\u2019t put their genetics to good use without applying themselves properly. Behind every personal record (PR) is a runner who chose to show up for the daily grind and trust in the process. As running coaches David and Megan Roche like to say, \u201covernight successes are actually years in the making.\u201d But the PR\u2019s themselves get more attention than the work that went into them. It\u2019s much easier to stand on a starting line than it is to show up for all the training leading up to that point\u2014especially for female athletes. Safety concerns, physiological burdens and the demands of motherhood make it more difficult to clock quality mileage. Oiselle aims to reduce the barriers to entry for women who struggle to make the miles happen. \u201cMost runners tend to want to run to perform,\u201d acknowledges Oiselle CEO Arielle Knutson. \u201cBut performance starts with the ability to move comfortably and sustainably.\u201d With that in mind, Oiselle puts the focus on facilitating movement first and foremost. The Oiselle design process starts with meeting the needs of female runners. Performance benefits come about as a side effect of fulfilling those unique needs. The author, Lucie Hanes, on a run in the Oiselle Toolbelt Roga Shorts Lina Simpson For Forbes To truly make movement more accessible for women, though, running apparel has to go beyond the basics. Sweat-wicking properties and lightweight fabrics might speak to runners in general, but they aren\u2019t enough to support female runners specifically. Knutson breaks down the concerns of female runners into four main categories: safety, storage, body and time. Women have good reason to worry about making it home from their runs. The news proves that even the most mundane neighborhood loop comes with potential consequences. Knutson also points out that \u201cwhen you have breasts and hips, your body moves differently than if you don\u2019t, and clothes feel different depending on how those elements of the female body present themselves on different people.\u201d And speaking of female physiology, we have different nutritional needs than our male counterparts. According to Dr. Stacy Sims, author of two books and over 70 peer-reviewed studies on the physiological needs of female athletes, \u201cour core body temperature rises about twice as quickly when we start exercising,\u201d which increases our risk of dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. Research on the prominence of low energy availability in female athletes suggests that women should pay extra attention to mid-run fueling, too. All that adds up to more essentials (see: quick calories) that have to go somewhere. 360-degree pockets on the Toolbelt Roga Shorts allow for easy access to mid-run fuel. Lina Simpson For Forbes Every piece of Oiselle apparel addresses at least one of these categories, if not all four at once. The Firecracker line features reflective bird patterns for visibility in low light, while plentiful pockets provide handy storage for phones, gels, layers and anything else your run requires. A wide variety of lengths, inseams and heights account for the different ways that female bodies convey their curves. Long sleeves with built-in watch windows accommodate sneak peaks at your metrics in cold weather, for the many women who struggle with poor circulation. Bras with adjustable, hook-able straps accommodate nursing mothers. High-waisted bottoms prop up the abdomen for moms-to-be. And subtle colors, patterns and fits make Oiselle clothing on the whole appropriate for runs, gym sessions to carpool duties to Zoom meetings when there\u2019s no time for a wardrobe change. Wide straps plus a phone pocket between the shoulder blades combine comfort with accessibility on ... [+] the Flyout Bra. Lina Simpson For Forbes These are the kinds of details that make or break running apparel\u2014and running in general\u2014for women. The \u201cshrink it and pink it\u201d approach to female gear design has left us believing that we\u2019re the problem because we can\u2019t make do with the same things that work for men. But why should we? Women come to running with our own bodies, responsibilities and priorities. Oiselle puts running in the context of life as a woman. Root For The Underbird The busy lives and full plates of female runners means that it can be tough for even the most elite athletes to put all the pieces together. Oiselle took a step beyond thoughtful gear design to give women with top-tier potential the opportunity to actually apply it. \u201cOiselle works with athletes who are up-and-comers, who have yet to be sponsored, because a support system can mean everything,\u201d explains Knutson. \u201cWe launched the Underbird program leading up to the Olympic Team Trials Marathon to support five elite athletes who wanted to race for a spot on the team but might not have been able to get there logistically or perform their best on their own.\u201d These five runners received a stipend, gear and a platform to tell their stories leading up to the Trials. The storytelling component holds the most value for Oiselle. Knutson recognizes that \u201cthere\u2019s validity to sponsoring the very top athletes who are winning: they\u2019re influential and have high reach, which matters for brand exposure. But always winning isn\u2019t always relatable. The everyday runner tends to relate more with stories that include the challenges that all athletes experience, but that those in the spotlight all the time don\u2019t necessarily share. Life is not linear and it\u2019s inspiring to hear about athletes who are achieving that level of excellence while being normal humans with setbacks and work and families and late-onsets to running.\u201d The Oiselle Underbirds told their stories en route to the Olympic Trials. None of their contracts contained clauses dependent on performance or podiums. One runner didn\u2019t even make it to the start line due to injury. Oiselle\u2019s response? The brand continued supporting her through the Boston Marathon for another chance at seeing her efforts through. Oiselle doesn\u2019t hold its athletes to certain standards because Knutson and her team understand that nothing in running (or in life) is guaranteed. Supporting an ambitious athlete doesn\u2019t ensure results. It does, however, give them the best chance at success. \u201cWhen we work with an athlete, it\u2019s not just about the athlete but about the whole person,\u201d emphasizes Knutson. \u201cWe\u2019re working with them on the running level and the human level. It\u2019s not just about winning or performance, it\u2019s about the whole self. Ultimately, our athletes go on to perform well because they feel supported on all levels.\u201d Oiselle Gear Review Just as race results don\u2019t define athletes, clothes don\u2019t define Oiselle. The intention behind them does. These are a few pieces of apparel that exemplify Oiselle\u2019s intentions for female runners of all backgrounds and ambitions. A Hands-Free, Chafe-Free Sports Bra Oiselle Oiselle Flyout Bra What\u2019s with all the flimsy, strappy sports bras out there? Those might work for a low-impact yoga class, but they don\u2019t do much for stabilization while running, even for the not-so-well endowed. The Flyout Bra trades spindly straps for comprehensive coverage from shoulder to shoulder. The broad back provides more support up front by redistributing some of the weight. Wide shoulder straps won\u2019t dig into the skin either, especially under the pressure of running vests or bulky layers. Oiselle capitalizes on the additional back coverage by including a phone pocket between the shoulder blades. The Flyout isn\u2019t the first sports bra with a phone pocket that I\u2019ve tried, but it is the first that I\u2019ve been able to actually use. Others put the pocket too low on the back for my short arms and inflexible shoulders to reach, or made the pocket too narrow for a phone to easily slide in and out of without a wrestling match. The Flyout\u2019s smooth fabric in combination with the dimensions and placement of the pocket make this bra a comfortable, functional phone storage solution. A Full-Coverage Top To Streamline Your Runs Oiselle Oiselle Flyout Long Sleeve I will never buy a long sleeve shirt without a watch window ever again. And now I can finally retire all the shirts that I cut my own poor excuse for a watch window into. What seems like a small detail bears a lot of significance on the run. Women run colder than men, especially in the extremities, and experience reduced blood flow in the hands and feet in response to cold exposure. With that in mind, there\u2019s no compromising on hand coverage during chilly runs. That shouldn\u2019t mean that women have to sacrifice other aspects of their run in exchange. With the Flyout Long Sleeve, we don\u2019t have to. A simple, subtle slit in each wrist opens up to reveal your watch screen so runners can keep an eye on their metrics without breaking stride to fiddle with layers. Those wasted seconds add up when you\u2019re squeezing miles into your schedule like a game of Tetris. Plus, hitting paces and sticking to rest-to-work ratios matters during high intensity interval sessions. Access to data in real time makes a difference in helping runners meet their goals for the workout. Watch window aside, the Flyout Long Sleeve wins in brisk weather with its relaxed yet secure fit and ultralight yet protective fabric. Thumb holes and reinforced hems hold the whole shirt in place. No sweat, no chill, no bulk. Flowy Shorts That Don't Skimp On Storage Oiselle Oiselle Toolbelt Roga Shorts Running in flowy shorts feels nice and airy during warm weather workouts, but at the cost of practicality. Barely-there designs don\u2019t offer much or any storage space, even for just the essentials. I\u2019m left to choose between opting for compression shorts, which don\u2019t allow for nearly as much air flow on hot days, and breaking out a vest or belt, which feels like overkill on shorter runs. But the Toolbelt Roga Shorts have solved that dilemma. These shorts make smart use of real estate with 360-degree pockets all around the waistband. That way, the legs remain loose and light while the naturally tight part of the shorts holds your belongings. The stretch-mesh waistband pockets lie open at the top for easy access, with one zipper pocket on the sacrum for valuables, though even the open-top pockets pass the jump test for keeping a tight grip on their contents. All the pockets, both open and zippered, are deep enough to hold extra-large smartphones, too. I do find that these shorts run a bit big. Luckily, an internal drawcord helps cinch in the waist to keep the Roga\u2019s from slipping, especially when loaded down with equipment. Find them in three inseam lengths: Mac (1.75-inchh), Regular (4-inch) and Long (6-inch). Compression Shorts That Double As A Running Belt Oiselle Oiselle O-Mazing Power Shorts I\u2019m a big fan of storage around the waist rather than down the leg. The female body\u2019s center of gravity lies right below the belly button. Carrying weight close to that centralized point feels more stable and eliminates the bounce factor that throws off your stride. The 360-degree belt-style pocket system on the O-Mazing Power Shorts makes them similar to the Toolbelt Roga Shorts above, but in a lightly compressive rather than loose style. Unlike the Roga\u2019s, these pockets are all open at the top\u2014no zippers to safeguard valuables\u2014but feel more secure than the pockets on the Roga\u2019s due to the tighter fabric. There are also no seams separating the pockets from one another on the sides, so there\u2019s less of a length or width limit to what you can store inside. The same internal drawcord design helps customize the fit and supports the weight of your belongings. I reach for the O-Mazing\u2019s when I\u2019m pushing the envelope on how far I can go without lugging a running pack. The lack of a separate zippered pocket leaves room for a small flask like the HydraPak SoftFlask 250 to slide into the waistband along the low back instead. I find that the compressive fit of the O-Mazing Power Shorts can handle bigger, heavier loads without slipping down or riding up as well. The O-Mazing Power Shorts come in three different inseams: Mini (2.5-inch), Regular (5-inch) and Long (8-inch) Lucie Hanes Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions", "summary": "Oiselle empowers women from all walks of life to run confidently.

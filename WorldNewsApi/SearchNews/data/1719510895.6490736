{"id": 223741286, "title": "Sasha Jane Lowerson Made History as the First Trans Pro Surfer. She&#8217;s Just Getting Started", "text": "Watching Sasha Jane Lowerson paddle out into the chilly Pacific, it becomes hard to tell her apart from the couple of dozen other surfers waiting for their moment. Lowerson is patient, and it\u2019s a good while before she comes cruising in on a southerly, slow-rolling wave \u2014 the kind that takes you all the way in. At this moment, none of her pro titles really matter, nor do the culture-war dramas of being the first out transgender surfer on the competition circuit. The ride is everything. Until last week, Lowerson had spent months out of the ocean as she recovered from gender-affirming surgeries. Surfing hasn\u2019t felt the same since she came to recognize her true identity. \u201cIt\u2019s easier,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cI don\u2019t have this fake front up.\u201d Lowerson adds that she tried to catch some waves back in January, though \u201cit was a major fail\u201d \u2014 too soon after her procedures. Still, she uploaded footage from that day to her YouTube channel, where she has also chronicled her transition. It\u2019s a bright, breezy March afternoon at Surfers Point Cafe in Ventura, California. Lowerson is speaking candidly of past struggles and how she almost quit surfing when she began to transition in 2020. (She ended up contacting Surfing Australia, the country\u2019s governing body for the sport, and worked with it to implement a new policy for trans inclusion that allowed her to compete in the women\u2019s division.) Yet her mood matches the sunny calm of this beach town. Originally from Southwest Australia, she passes for a local with her bleached hair, ski hat, and cropped T-shirt. Lowerson, 45, has been surfing her whole life, and dominated plenty of men\u2019s events over the decades, claiming a Western Australian state title as recently as 2019. She laughs about acting like an \u201cuber dude\u201d back then, but recalls the difficulty of maintaining a \u201cfake\u201d macho persona: After a couple of weeks on the water, she\u2019d retreat inward, afraid to leave the house for days, and battle thoughts of self-harm. \u201cI\u2019d try and take my life,\u201d she says. Despite her impressive career so far, it seems only now, as a woman, in an adopted country, that she has the life she was looking for. \u201cI\u2019ve found the Californian community so much better\u201d than the surfing scene back home, Lowerson explains. \u201cEven the middle-aged cis white guy [here] accepts me in the water. Whereas, generally, in Western Australia, it\u2019s the polar opposite. Hopefully it changes.\u201d Lowerson came to the States in 2023 not just as an accomplished surfer, but also as a craftswoman who started learning the art of board design as a teen. In collaboration with Mando, a nonbinary board shaper from California and owner of Mando Surf Co. in Carmel, she spent five years developing the Sasha Jane signature model longboard, a \u201cnose rider\u201d with a mermaid logo \u2014 Lowerson\u2019s is pastel-pink. To become the brand\u2019s official ambassador, Lowerson is applying for a work visa, and she might eventually try for U.S. citizenship. Mando is an ideal fit for Lowerson thanks to a shared philosophy about expanding surf culture to all kinds of people. We walk to her van so she can show off a Mando model she particularly admires \u2014 she\u2019s shaped a few herself \u2014 called the \u201cShrimp Taco.\u201d It\u2019s adorably small, though Lowerson explains that it could support a 250-pound rider and fits in the average car trunk. \u201cThe ocean\u2019s for everyone to share and enjoy,\u201d she says, and Mando\u2019s mission is to \u201cmake surfing accessible to anyone.\u201d Of course, not every brand takes that approach. Last January, the Australian surfing-gear company Rip Curl debuted an online ad featuring Lowerson on the water. In a voice-over, she describes surfing as a dance on a moving surface. There is no mention of gender or competition. Soon after the video came out, American pro surfer Bethany Hamilton, who is sponsored by Rip Curl and had already vocally opposed the inclusion of trans women athletes in women\u2019s categories, tweeted, \u201cMale-bodied athletes should not be competing in female sports.\u201d Though she did not name Lowerson, Rip Curl yanked the clip two days later, claiming it was for Lowerson\u2019s safety. \u201cWhich was just the biggest load of bullshit ever,\u201d Lowerson says. (Hamilton and Rip Curl did not respond to requests for comment.) Lowerson\u2019s impulse, when Rip Curl had originally reached out, was to turn them down because of their association with Hamilton. Then she thought the ad could be a win for trans representation and agreed to it. In her view, the company was just \u201cnaive\u201d about the trollish responses they\u2019d get, despite her warnings of a rage maelstrom like the one conservatives whipped up over trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney\u2019s endorsement of Bud Light last year. The same hostility had erupted in 2022, when Lowerson won two women\u2019s divisions at the Western Australian state titles. She\u2019d already made history as the first out trans woman to surf at the pro level two months prior; she just happened to place ninth in that event. It was taking a title that prompted indignant headlines in conservative media. \u201cFor trans athletes, it\u2019s OK for us to compete if we don\u2019t do well,\u201d Lowerson laments. Lowerson drives us back to where she\u2019s staying in Ventura, the home of friend Rachel Lord, another board shaper who operates a business called Lord Bords out of a shed studio in her backyard. We\u2019re greeted by Lord and her sweet, scruffy dog. \u201cTiny Guy!\u201d Lowerson cries. (It\u2019s not merely a term of affection but the pup\u2019s proper name.) Lord and Lowerson explain that their plans to surf that morning had been derailed after they found another dog loose on the street and combed the neighborhood for hours trying to find the owner, only to discover it lived right across the street. \u201cThe waves are good, hon,\u201d Lowerson tells Lord, who pulls up a streaming camera feed that shows the current surf conditions. The two gossip a bit about the other locals they might encounter on the water today, though there\u2019s nobody Lowerson really worries she\u2019ll run into. \u201cI don\u2019t talk any sort of disrespect or flack here,\u201d she reiterates. \u201cYou know, being out in the local bars after surfing, at night, eating and drinking, people are super happy to meet me and chat.\u201d And just existing as herself in the public eye is a victory. \u201cYou know, being visible is important,\u201d Lowerson says. \u201cBecause you can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see. That\u2019s important for me, to sort of help the next generation.\u201d Attaining that positive visibility can be a challenge in itself. The organizers of a May event in Huntington Beach, California \u2014 it was meant to be her first following her surgeries \u2014 barred Lowerson from participating even though they initially accepted her entry fee. She says their reasoning was based on a misinterpretation of an International Surfing Association rule that she knows inside and out. The California Coastal Commission ruled that the decision violated a state anti-discrimination law and that Lowerson must be allowed to compete, though she ultimately opted to skip the event. While these setbacks are frustrating, they haven\u2019t diminished her passion. Lowerson received an outpouring of support from other pros, including members of the world-champion Hawaiian longboarding team, who encouraged her to keep competing. Meanwhile, orders are coming in for her new board, and she\u2019s working on a memoir about growing up during the Nineties surf boom. When she and Lord and I arrive back at the beach so they can finally suit up and get their rides in for the day, they end up talking to a few friends just packing up to leave, discussing how unusually cold the water is and swapping stories of gnarly injuries. \u201cThis is the lot scene,\u201d Lowerson says cheerfully as she applies sunblock to her face. It\u2019s the warm, welcoming, distinctively Californian community she described earlier, and there\u2019s no doubt she belongs in it. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as a trailblazer,\u201d the modest Lowerson says, though she expresses a hope that \u201cthere\u2019s one girl out there that opens your magazine and says, \u2018She\u2019s doing it. I can do it.\u2019\u201d", "summary": "The Aussie athlete is embarking on a new chapter in America following her transition \u2014 and riding waves like never before", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/trans-surfer-sasha-jane-lowerson-interview-1235025958/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sasha-jane-lowerson-2.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:30:00", "author": "Miles Klee", "authors": ["Miles Klee"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.116}

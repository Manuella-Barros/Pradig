Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader.\n\nBoth were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft -- 22 years apart -- and landed on last-place teams.\n\nClark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center.\n\nNow a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners.\n\nBird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will \"dramatically\" change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster.\n\nClark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000.\n\nThe NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State's Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.\n\nBird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women's Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nBird: If I'm being honest, we've done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it's the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you're going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there's a soft cap -- now we're talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\n\nBird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains. I'm sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world -- the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There's a popularity and you're connecting with a brand. There's no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way.\n\nBird: Just being able to do what I want. It's nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that's exactly what we'd be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We're trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.\n\nBird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don't get it -- women, women of color. They're so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women's sports. We've adapted a book \"Cleat Cute,\" it's an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA championship games while becoming the Division I career scoring leader.\n\nBoth were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft -- 22 years apart -- and landed on last-place teams.\n\nClark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center.\n\nNow a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players-turned-owners.\n\nBird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will \"dramatically\" change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster.\n\nClark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000.\n\nThe NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick, Victor Wembanyama, earned $12.1 million in his rookie season with San Antonio. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State's Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.\n\nBird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women's Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nWays the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League?\n\nBird: If I'm being honest, we've done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it's the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you're going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there's a soft cap -- now we're talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\n\nWhat about the expense argument against a WNBA G League?\n\nBird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nTalk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes?\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains. I'm sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world -- the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There's a popularity and you're connecting with a brand. There's no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way.\n\nYou've done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career?\n\nBird: Just being able to do what I want. It's nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that's exactly what we'd be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We're trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.\n\nWhat content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More?\n\nBird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don't get it -- women, women of color. They're so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women's sports. We've adapted a book \"Cleat Cute,\" it's an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.\n\nAP WNBA: https://apnews.com/hub/wnba-basketball", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com",

Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader.\n\nBoth were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft -- 22 years apart -- and landed on last-place teams.\n\nClark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center.\n\nNow a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners.\n\nBird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will \"dramatically\" change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster.\n\nClark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000.\n\nThe NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State's Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.\n\nBird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women's Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nBird: If I'm being honest, we've done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it's the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you're going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there's a soft cap -- now we're talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\n\nBird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains. I'm sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world -- the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There's a popularity and you're connecting with a brand. There's no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way.\n\nBird: Just being able to do what I want. It's nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that's exactly what we'd be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We're trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.\n\nBird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don't get it -- women, women of color. They're so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women's sports.

The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State's Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.\n\nBird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women's Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWays the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League?\n\nBird: If I'm being honest, we've done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it's the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you're going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there's a soft cap -- now we're talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\n\nWhat about the expense argument against a WNBA G League?\n\nBird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nTalk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes?\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains. I'm sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world -- the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There's a popularity and you're connecting with a brand. There's no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way.\n\nYou've done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career?\n\nBird: Just being able to do what I want. It's nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that's exactly what we'd be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We're trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.\n\nWhat content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More?\n\nBird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don't get it -- women, women of color. They're so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women's sports. We've adapted a book \"Cleat Cute,\" it's an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader.Both were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft -- 22 years apart -- and landed on last-place teams.Clark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center.Now a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners.Bird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will \"dramatically\" change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster.Clark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000.The NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State's Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.Bird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women's Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity:Ways the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League?Bird: If I'm being honest, we've done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it's the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you're going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there's a soft cap -- now we're talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.What about the expense argument against a WNBA G League?Bird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.Talk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes?Bird: I love NIL. I know it's complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains. I'm sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world -- the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There's a popularity and you're connecting with a brand. There's no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way.You've done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career?Bird: Just being able to do what I want. It's nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that's exactly what we'd be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We're trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.What content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More?Bird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don't get it -- women, women of color.

We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there's a soft cap -- now we're talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\n\nWhat about the expense argument against a WNBA G League?\n\nBird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTalk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes?\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains. I'm sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world -- the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There's a popularity and you're connecting with a brand. There's no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way.\n\nYou've done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career?\n\nBird: Just being able to do what I want. It's nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that's exactly what we'd be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We're trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.\n\nWhat content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More?\n\nBird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don't get it -- women, women of color. They're so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women's sports.

That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster.\n\nClark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000.\n\nThe NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State's Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.\n\nBird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women's Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWays the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League?\n\nBird: If I'm being honest, we've done our part (as players).

That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster.\n\nClark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000.\n\nThe NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State's Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.\n\nBird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women's Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWays the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League?\n\nBird: If I'm being honest, we've done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it's the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you're going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there's a soft cap -- now we're talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\n\nWhat about the expense argument against a WNBA G League?\n\nBird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nTalk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes?\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains. I'm sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world -- the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There's a popularity and you're connecting with a brand. There's no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way.\n\nYou've done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career?\n\nBird: Just being able to do what I want. It's nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that's exactly what we'd be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We're trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.\n\nWhat content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More?\n\nBird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don't get it -- women, women of color. They're so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women's sports. We've adapted a book \"Cleat Cute,\" it's an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot

Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader.\n\nBoth were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft -- 22 years apart -- and landed on last-place teams.\n\nClark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader.\n\nBoth were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft -- 22 years apart -- and landed on last-place teams.\n\nClark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center.\n\nNow a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster.\n\nClark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000.\n\nThe NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State's Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.\n\nBird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women's Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWays the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League?\n\nBird: If I'm being honest, we've done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it's the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you're going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there's a soft cap -- now we're talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\n\nWhat about the expense argument against a WNBA G League?\n\nBird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nTalk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes?\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains. I'm sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world -- the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There's a popularity and you're connecting with a brand. There's no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way.\n\nYou've done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career?\n\nBird: Just being able to do what I want. It's nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that's exactly what we'd be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We're trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.\n\nWhat content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More?\n\nBird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don't get it -- women, women of color. They're so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women's sports. We've adapted a book \"Cleat Cute,\" it's an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot

Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader.\n\nBoth were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft -- 22 years apart -- and landed on last-place teams.\n\nClark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center.\n\nNow a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster.\n\nClark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000.\n\nThe NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State's Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.\n\nBird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women's Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWays the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League?\n\nBird: If I'm being honest, we've done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it's the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you're going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there's a soft cap -- now we're talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\n\nWhat about the expense argument against a WNBA G League?\n\nBird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nTalk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes?\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains. I'm sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world -- the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There's a popularity and you're connecting with a brand. There's no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way.\n\nYou've done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career?\n\nBird: Just being able to do what I want. It's nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that's exactly what we'd be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We're trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.\n\nWhat content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More?\n\nBird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don't get it -- women, women of color. They're so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women's sports. We've adapted a book \"Cleat Cute,\" it's an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot

Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader.\n\nBoth were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft - 22 years apart - and landed on last-place teams.\n\nClark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center.\n\nNow a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners.\n\nMegan Rapinoe, left, and Sue Bird, right, sit courtside during the second half of the WNBA basketball game between the Indiana Fever and the New York Liberty, Saturday, May 18, 2024, in New York.

Murray)\n\nBird thinks more lucrative broadcast rights contracts and an improved collective bargaining agreement will \"dramatically\" change the WNBA landscape in the next few years. That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster.\n\nClark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000.\n\nThe NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State\u00b4s Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.\n\nBird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women\u00b4s Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nBird: If I\u00b4m being honest, we\u00b4ve done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it\u00b4s the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you\u00b4re going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there\u00b4s a soft cap - now we\u00b4re talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year - so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\n\nBird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out - the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it\u00b4s just growing pains. I\u00b4m sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle.

But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nTalk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes?\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains. I'm sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world -- the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There's a popularity and you're connecting with a brand. There's no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way.\n\nYou've done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career?\n\nBird: Just being able to do what I want.

Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader.\n\nBoth were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft -- 22 years apart -- and landed on last-place teams.\n\nClark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center.\n\nNow a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster.\n\nClark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000.\n\nThe NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State's Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.\n\nBird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women's Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWays the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League?\n\nBird: If I'm being honest, we've done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it's the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you're going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there's a soft cap -- now we're talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\n\nWhat about the expense argument against a WNBA G League?\n\nBird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nTalk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes?\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains. I'm sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world -- the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There's a popularity and you're connecting with a brand. There's no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way.\n\nYou've done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career?\n\nBird: Just being able to do what I want. It's nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that's exactly what we'd be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We're trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.\n\nWhat content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More?\n\nBird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don't get it -- women, women of color. They're so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women's sports.

Now it's the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you're going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there's a soft cap -- now we're talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\n\nWhat about the expense argument against a G League?\n\nBird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas.

Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nTalk about the impact of NIL\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains.

Clark led her Iowa team to consecutive NCAA Championship games while becoming the NCAA Division I career scoring leader.\n\nBoth were No. 1 picks in the WNBA draft -- 22 years apart -- and landed on last-place teams.\n\nClark's Indiana Fever have just one win in their first seven games. Bird, who eventually won four WNBA titles with Seattle, recommends patience for Clark. She recently watched courtside when New York beat Clark and Indiana before more than 17,000 fans at the Barclays Center.\n\nNow a part-owner of the Storm, Bird joins Lisa Leslie (LA Sparks) and Renee Montgomery (Atlanta Dream) as former WNBA players turned owners.\n\nPeople are also reading...

That may include better salaries, more teams and more players on a roster.\n\nClark will earn just $76,000 as the No. 1 pick, although she signed NIL deals in college with Gatorade, State Farm and recently with Wilson as a pro. However, many in the WNBA still compete in other countries to supplement their income, given the 2024 veteran super maximum is $241,000.\n\nThe NBA has broadcast rights that generate more than $20 billion in revenue, and the 2023 top draft pick Victor Wembanyama earned $12.1 million in his rookie season. The NBA minimum salary is $1.1 million, with Golden State's Steph Curry the top earner at $51.9 million this year.\n\nBird spoke with The Associated Press during the recent Business of Women's Sports Summit in New York City on several topics. Her comments have been edited for clarity and brevity:\n\nWays the WNBA can grow: Larger rosters, more teams, a G League?\n\nBird: If I'm being honest, we've done our part (as players). The product on the floor has never been better. Now it's the media rights deal, its on corporate sponsors to continue to show up and view us as an investment. But once we see this media rights deal, assuming its going to be what we all think its going to be, you're going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA. It will be a whole new world. We have a hard salary cap somewhere in the $1.4 million range. But once the money gets interjected and maybe there's a soft cap -- now we're talking. The media rights contract is up this year. The CBA has an opt out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\n\nWhat about the expense argument against a WNBA G League?\n\nBird: I think long term, you want the WNBA to be thriving in a way where people feel like they don't have to go overseas. But I do still see overseas as a viable option for players who want to continue to play in their offseason and get paid a lot of money. Even if there was a G League, the money would still be better overseas.\n\nTalk about the impact of NIL and how it elevates the brand of athletes?\n\nBird: I love NIL. I know its complicated in terms of figuring it out -- the ways in which schools participate in it, collectives and deals. To me, it's just growing pains. I'm sure there will be some rule changes as they go, but it will all settle. Kids coming into college have access to the greatest marketing machine in the world -- the NCAA Tournament and ... being on ESPN. There's a popularity and you're connecting with a brand. There's no better example than Caitlin Clark, who signed a deal with Nike in college and look who followed her to the pros. It impacts the whole ecosystem in a wonderful way.\n\nYou've done TV commentary with Diana Taurasi, but what's been the most fun about your post-basketball career?\n\nBird: Just being able to do what I want. It's nice to not have to worry that I have to eat by 4 p.m. because my game is at 7 p.m. They see us hanging out on the couch watching the game and that's exactly what we'd be doing if we were at home with no cameras. We're trying to get a bigger piece of the pie in terms of coverage, having women cover the sport and former athletes cover the sport.\n\nWhat content do you and partner Megan Rapinoe hope to highlight with your production company, A Touch More?\n\nBird: We want to shine a light on those that normally don't get it -- women, women of color. They're so important and crucial to the backbone of all you see in women's sports. We've adapted a book \"Cleat Cute,\" it's an incredibly popular book in the LGBTQ space, into a TV show.\n\nAP Sports Week in Pictures: Caitlin Clark's debut, Fury on the ropes and golf's winning shot

From rookie guard Caitlin Clark receiving a $28 million sponsorship deal from Nike to skyrocketing viewership to legends like Sue Bird becoming an owner in her beloved Seattle Storm, the stage is being set for a wild next few years for the league.\n\nThe WNBA's CBA is inching closer to the opt-out period and a new media rights deal is looming. The WNBA and the Players Association each have the option, exercisable by providing written notice on or before Nov. 1, 2024, to terminate the CBA effective on Oct. 31, 2025, or, if later, on the day following the final playoff game of the 2025 season.\n\nThe WNBA currently earns around $60 million annually from its media rights deal, but a new deal could draw a much bigger amount. WNBA commissioner Kathy Engelbert believes the league could at least double the media rights fee.]\n\nBird weighed in on what a new media rights deal could mean.\n\n\"But once we see this media rights deal, assuming it's going to be what we all think it's going to be, you're going to see things dramatically change in the WNBA,\" Bird told The Associated Press. \"It will be a whole new world.

The CBA has an opt-out next year -- so by 2026, it could be dramatically different.\"\n\nAs more money is infused into the league and the players, the bigger changes we will begin to see and those changes could be implemented into the new CBA. A few changes expected to be seen in a new iteration of the CBA include charter flights and a salary cap increase, which, in turn, will see higher salaries.\n\nAs with any growth, there will be growing pains, as we are now seeing with the investigation into the Las Vegas Aces players' most recent sponsorship deal with the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. But growing pains don't have to last a long time and the more flexible the owners and league are with the increased interest, the better it will be for the league, the players and the fans.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Continental Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Bird", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sue Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Storm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Storm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Aces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Aces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Convention_and_Visitors_Authority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/m224Xt1XjJ.LpNTqMkE5DA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/rookie_wire_usa_today_sports_articles_968/620e622c4623c6097b47fd305c9350dd", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601572", "eventUri": "eng-9601572", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 454625808, "relevance": 2}

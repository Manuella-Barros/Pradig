(Photo: Facebook/Heather Heyer)\n\nDuring the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, a neo-Nazi plowed his Dodge Challenger into a crowd of peaceful counter demonstrators. Heather Heyer, 32, a paralegal with the Miller Law Group was killed.\n\nHeyer was one of the approximately 20 people hit as they stood in a crowd in the street to oppose the hundreds of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and Alt-Right groups who stormed the city near the University of Virginia. The racist rally over the weekend was in response to the decision to remove the statues of Confederate leaders.\n\nAccording got the New York Daily News, the crash impact left Heyer lying on the pavement alongside another bloodied victim who was wearing a black shirt emblazoned with words of protest.\n\nCharlottesville Police Chief Alfred Thomas Jr. said during the press conference after the rally that the woman was killed while simply crossing the street at the wrong time.\n\nThe man believed to be behind the wheel, 20-year-old James Fields Jr., then sped the mangled sports car away in reverse. He was later arrested and charged in the attack, just hours after standing alongside members of the Vanguard America hate group during the rally.\n\nIt's unclear if Heyer was with demonstrators protesting the white supremacist rally that ended a short time earlier.\n\nHeyer's last public Facebook post suggested she had a reason to be downtown Saturday.\n\n\"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention,\" wrote Heyer.\n\n\"She died doing what was right. My heart is broken, but I am forever proud of her,\" said Heyer's childhood friend Felicia Correa, who spoke on behalf of the victim's mother.\n\nCorrea learned of Heyer's death through her sister, another paralegal at the Charlottesville law firm.\n\n\"We grew up together. We lived on the same street, went to the same school, rode the bus together and played together,\" Correa said.\n\nAnother family member, Keri Vivona, was unable to speak fluidly when contacted by the media.\n\n\"Our family is trying to process this terrible tragedy,\" she said, according to the NYDN.\n\nCorrea said she plans to pay tribute to Heyer with a candlelight vigil at 7 p.m., Sunday, August 13, at Emancipation Park in Charlottesville.", "time": "15:07:00"}

injuring at least nineteen others.\n\nAfter driving into the crowd, Fields reversed and drove off, with the front of his car \"all smashed up\", eyewitnesses said.\n\nHe was arrested later that afternoon on suspicion of criminal homicide, police said.\n\nThe victim has been identified as 32-year-old Heather Heyer, a paralegal from nearby Greene County.\n\nHer death was announced in a tweet by Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer who wrote: \"I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will - go home.\"\n\nTributes flooded in for Heyer, whose last Facebook post read \"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention\". A Crowdfunding page raising money for Heyer's family had raised more than $32,000 at the time of publication.\n\nThe page read: \"Heather Heyer was murdered while protesting against hate. Her mother said: 'She died doing what was right. My heart is broken, but I am forever proud of her.'

One of the pages, called \"Our Sister's Keeper #HeatherHeyer\" was created by Felicia Venita Correa from Charlottesville. Its description read: \"Heather Heyer was murdered while protesting against hate. We are raising money to give to her family for anything that they may need. She is a Greene County native and Graduated from William Monroe High School. She will truly be missed.\" The page mentioned a goal of raising $20,000, and it had already managed to raise $23,653 at the time of publishing this article.\n\nNineteen other people were injured in the attack after the car driver, identified as James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, went on a rampage.

It has been going on for a long time in our country -- not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America.\"\n\nHe also tweeted about Heyer saying:\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe also condemned the protests and said: \"It is now clear that public safety cannot be safeguarded without additional powers, and that the mostly-out-of-state protesters have come to Virginia to endanger our citizens and property.

counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, has been identified.\n\nHe is James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, according to Superintendent Martin Kumer with the Albermarle-Charlottesville County Regional Jail, cited by CNN.\n\nFields is being held on suspicion of second-degree murder, as well as malicious wounding and failure to stop in an accident that resulted in death.\n\nDaily Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek delivered to your inbox\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr. Handout\n\nOne person was killed and 19 injured when a car ploughed into a group who had gathered to oppose the white nationalist rally Saturday.\n\nThe car hit a 32-year-old woman crossing the street, killing her, police said. She has been identified on fundraising website GoFundMe as Heather Heyer, who a schoolfriend said was \"protesting against hate,\" with $35,000 raised for her family by the time of publication.\n\nPolice have not yet confirmed her identity.\n\nAccording to online records cited by USA Today, Fields Jr.'s car was purchased from a Greater Cincinnati car dealership and last registered in Ohio. Online records do not show any criminal record for Fields, according to the outlet. The assailant's mother, Samantha Bloom, told the Toldeo Blade that Fields traveled to Charlottesville for the Unite the Right rally.\n\nHe reportedly told Bloom last week that he was heading to an \"alt right\" rally in Virginia.\n\n\"I try to stay out of his political views. I don't get too involved,\" she told the newspaper.\n\n\"I told him to be careful,\" she said, \"if they are going to rally, to make sure he is doing it peacefully.\" She then broke down in tears.\n\nShe later told Associated Press that she believed the rally had been to support President Trump.\n\n\"I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist,\" Bloom told the AP.\n\n\"He had an African-American friend so ...,\" she said, trailing off.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League circulated a picture showing Fields demonstrating with members of Vanguard America, a white nationalist group involved in Saturday's protest.\n\nIn a statement, the group denied Fields was a member.\n\nFootage of the incident shows the vehicle driving at speed into the crowd before crashing into another vehicle then reversing at high speed and turning left to speed off, pursued by police.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the crash to determine if the crime involved civil rights violations, which could pave the way for hate crime charges being filed.\n\nIn a separate incident, two police officers were killed when a helicopter monitoring the rally crashed near Charlottesville, police said Saturday.", "time": "09:35:00"}

As of Saturday evening, five of the injured were in critical condition, four were in serious condition, six were in fair condition and four others were in good condition, NBC reported.\n\nPolice said it didn't take long to locate Fields, given the extensive damage to his car and the fact that his vehicle's characteristics and license plate were widely recorded on video.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said Saturday night that the FBI and Department of Justice would be opening an investigation into the incident, in addition to the local and state investigations already ongoing.\n\nJUST IN: DOJ opens civil rights investigation into incident where car used to mow down protesters in Charlottesville killing 1, injuring 19. pic.twitter.com/kOoMOZQNj9\n\n-- Paula Reid (@PaulaReidCBS) August 13, 2017\n\nSaturday's protests in Charlottesville were marked by violence and death.

The most recent public Facebook post that Heather published featured Heyer sharing a Facebook message that claimed if a person wasn't outraged, they are not paying attention. Heyer's Facebook post is getting thousands of shares in the wake of her death. Heyer is collecting Facebook comments that praise her for fighting the good fight against hate and racism. Heyer's death has brought plenty of likes to her Facebook posts, which proclaim that ISIS should not be equated with all of Islam.\n\nAs seen in photos like the one below, hateful graffiti was written on the ground, with KKK written in chalk at the rally. Heyer's family is in the midst of trying to process the tragedy that took Heather's life, while the GoFundMe page named \"Our Sister's Keeper #HeatherHeyer\" has raised $73,073 of its $50,000 goal thus far. There is a candlelight tribute for Heather planned for Sunday evening at 7 p.m. at Emancipation Park.\n\nAs seen in the top photo above, a man who was demonstrating against the white nationalist party sprayed lighted flames at a white nationalist demonstrator.

(AP) - Authorities say a 20-year-old Ohio man accused of driving a car into a group of counter-protesters at a white nationalist rally has been charged with second-degree murder and other counts.\n\nThe Charlottesville Police Department said in a statement Saturday night that James Alex Fields Jr. of Ohio also faces three counts of malicious wounding, and one count related to leaving the scene.\n\nCol. Martin Kumer, superintendent of the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, said Fields was in custody there Saturday night. Kumer says he doesn't believe Fields has obtained an attorney yet.\n\nHe says a bond hearing is scheduled for Monday.\n\nWitnesses say Fields' car plowed into a crowd of people who were protesting a rally, which was held by white nationalists who oppose the removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee by the city of Charlottesville. At least 26 other people were treated at local hospitals.\n\nMeanwhile, a woman who identified herself as the mother of Fields says he told her he was going to the rally.\n\nSamantha Bloom, of Ohio, confirmed details about her son's car and his trip to Virginia, saying she received a text from him last week that said he'd gotten some time off from work and was going to a rally.\n\nShe said her son hadn't given her any details about the rally but that she told him \"to be careful\" and to peaceful.\n\nBloom became visibly upset as she learned that dozens of people were injured.\n\nBloom said she and Fields had just relocated to the Toledo area from Florence, Kentucky, a Cincinnati, Ohio, suburb.\n\nThere were also two other deaths connected to Saturday event. A Virginia state police helicopter that was assisting in the law enforcement response crashed.\n\nPolice said Lt. H. Jay Cullen of Midlothian and Trooper-pilot Berke M.M. Bates of Quinton were killed in the crash. The two were monitoring the white nationalist rally at the time.\n\n\u00a9 2017 Associated Press\n\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST", "time": "00:41:00"}

A Virginia State Police helicopter that was assisting those despatched to bring the violence on the ground under control crashed near a golf course and burst into flames.\n\nThe pilot, Lt H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Berke MM Bates, 40, a trooper-pilot of Quinton, Virginia., died at the scene.", "time": "17:01:00"}

The far-right protesters focused on the possible removal of a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a park in the city. Pockets of violence erupted throughout the city as white nationalists, white supremacists and neo-nazis clashed with their detractors, igniting in a flashpoint with the vehicular attack.\n\nThe woman killed was identified as a 32-year-old named Heather Heyer.\n\nALSO READ: Who Is Heather Heyer?

Photo: Charlottesville Police Department/REUTERS\n\nFields was photographed earlier on Saturday before the incident with other far-right people during their rally. Fields brandished symbols of a group called Vanguard America, a white-supremacy group. Vanguard America denied Field's involvement with the group in a statement on Twitter.\n\n\"The driver of the vehicle that hit counterprotesters today was, in no way, a member of Vanguard America,\" read the statement. \"All our members had been safely evacuated by the time of the incident. The shields seen do not denote membership, nor does the white shirt. The shirts were freely handed out to anyone in attendance.\"\n\nFields was apprehended shortly after the crash by Virginia police.\n\nThe violence saw widespread condemnation by politicians, many of whom directed ire towards the hateful ideologies espoused by many of the far-right marchers.\n\n\"The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated,\" said Attorney General Jess Sessions.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also reacted but was criticized for not directly calling out groups who supported bigotry at the rally.\n\nREAD: Donald Trump's Bizarre Twitter Habits: Did President Accidentally 'Like' Protester's Tweet?\n\n\"We are closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville, Virginia. We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides. It has been going on for a long time in our country -- not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America,\" said Trump to reporters Saturday.\n\nLocal authorities, the F.B.I. and Justice Department are all continuing investigations into the car crash and other violence Charlottesville over the weekend.", "time": "16:36:00"}

charged with second-degree murder and other counts.

Martin Kumer, superintendent of the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, said Fields was in custody there Saturday night. Kumer says he doesn't believe Fields has obtained an attorney yet. He says a bond hearing is scheduled for Monday.\n\nA woman who identified herself as Fields' mother says he told her he was going to the rally but she wasn't aware of the nature of the event.\n\nSamantha Bloom, of Ohio, apparently only learned of the Charlottesville attack from AP reporters who came to interview her about her son.\n\nBloom confirmed details about her son's car and his trip to Virginia, saying she received a text from him last week that said he'd gotten some time off from work and was going to a rally.\n\nShe said her son hadn't given her any details about the rally but that she told him \"to be careful\" and to peaceful.\n\n\"I just knew he was going to a rally,\" Bloom told AP. \"I mean, I try to stay out of his political views. You know, we don't, you know, I don't really get too involved, I moved him out to his own apartment, so we I'm watching his cat.\"\n\n\"I thought it had something to do with Trump,\" Bloom said about the rally. \"Trump's not a white supremacist,\" she said.\n\n\"He had an African-American friend so ...,\" she said of her son.\n\nBloom became visibly upset as she learned that dozens of people were injured in Charlottesville.\n\nBloom said she and Fields had just relocated to the Toledo area from Florence, Kentucky, a Cincinnati, Ohio, suburb\n\nU.S. officials have opened a civil rights investigation into the circumstances of the deadly car attack.\n\nThe investigation was announced late Saturday by officials of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia and the Richmond field office of the FBI.\n\nIn a statement, Attorney General Jeff Sessions says U.S. Attorney Rick Mountcastle has begun the investigation and will have the full support of the Justice Department.\n\nSessions says, \"The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice.\"\n\nHe adds, \"When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nThree more men have been arrested in connection to the violent clashes between white supremacists and counter-protesters in Charlottesville.\n\nThe Virginia State Police announced late Saturday that Troy Dunigan, a 21-year-old from Chattanooga, Tennessee, was charged with disorderly conduct; Jacob L. Smith, a 21-year-old from Louisa, Virginia, was charged with assault and battery; and James M. O'Brien, 44, of Gainesville, Florida, was charged with carrying a concealed handgun.\n\nAside from the woman killed in the car-ramming, two state police troopers died when their helicopter crashed in the woods on the outskirts of town.\n\nThe organizer of the white nationalist rally says he disavows the violence that eroded it.\n\nJason Kessler said in an interview Saturday evening that whoever drove a car into a group of counter-protesters \"did the wrong thing.\" He said he was saddened that people were hurt.\n\nKessler is a local blogger and activist who described the event as a pro-white rally. He planned it to protest the city's decision to remove a Confederate monument.\n\nHe also criticized law enforcement's response to the event, which was dispersed before speakers could take the stage.\n\nHe said they did a poor job controlling the chaos to allow free speech.", "time": "08:43:00"}

As The Daily Beast reported, police arrested Fields on suspicion of second-degree murder. Fields is from the town of Maumee, Ohio, though it was not clear if he traveled to Virginia specifically for the rally.\n\nWhite supremacists had targeted Charlottesville because the town had taken down a statue of Robert E. Lee, the New York Times reported. There were several skirmishes between white nationalists and counter-protesters, the report added, including close to two dozen injured in the car attack. Witnesses said the driver intentionally plowed through the crowd at a speed of close to 40 miles per hour.\n\nThe killings came amid a day of heightened tensions in Charlottesville, with white supremacists and Nazis gathered amid what was billed as \"Unite the Right\" rally. There were tensions between both sides even before the rally began, and Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency on Saturday.\n\nVideos of the car attack spread quickly on Saturday, showing the car plowing through a panicked crowd. Pictures of James Alex Fields Jr. started to hit the internet within hours of his arrest being announced, including a mugshot of the 20-year-old.\n\nWhile there are still many unanswered questions about James Alex Fields Jr., including whether he had an active presence on Facebook or other social media, there have been some clues from the social media accounts of family members. Some news outlets cited his mother's Facebook page, claiming in 2015 that James was departing for boot camp.\n\nMilitary records show that he had a very brief stint in the U.S. Army, joining in August 2015 and leaving the Army by December of that year, just weeks after basic training would have ended. There was no record as to why Fields left the Army.\n\nOther pictures emerged of James Alex Fields Jr. from social media, including a shot from Facebook of a brooding James with a woman identified as his mother.\n\nPolice have not yet said if James Alex Fields Jr. is facing formal charges, or if they could potentially be upgraded if more victims die from the attack.", "time": "03:58:00"}

Heather Heyer was killed by this madman, so get to know about this tragic victim.\n\n1. She died while protesting the \"Unite The Right\" rally. Heather Heyer, 32, was one of the many counter-protesters voicing their opposition to the \"Unite The Right\" rally on Aug. 12. The event was a collection of far-right demonstrators and white nationalists protesting the removal of Confederate monuments, specifically the moving of the Robert E. Lee statue from Emancipation Park. \"Heather Heyer was murdered while protesting against hate,\" a friend wrote on a GoFundMe.com page started for Heather, as she was killed when James Alex Fields Jr., 20, drove his gray Dodger Challenger down a narrow street lined with counter-protesters.\n\nHeather was crossing the street when she was hit, according to the New York Daily News. 19 other people were injured. \"[Heather] died doing what was right,\" her childhood friend, Felicia Correa, said while speaking on behalf of her friend's mother. \"My heart is broken, but I am forever proud of her.\"\n\n2. She was a Virginia native. \"We grew up together. We lived on the same street, went to the same school, rode the bus together and played together,\" Felicia told the New York Daily News. Heather grew up in Green County, graduating from William Monroe High School. Her LinkedIn page said she worked as a paralegal at the Miller Law Group in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n3. Heather was politically active before her death. \"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.\" That quote, popular with political activists, adorns Heather's Facebook page. She often shared her political beliefs to Facebook, according to Heavy.com. During the 2016 presidential election, she shared a video about how if someone was scared of Muslim, they should actually meet a Muslim to end those fears. She also expressed her support for Bernie Sanders, 75, during the Democratic primary.\n\n4. She may not be the only one killed in that crash. As of Aug. 13, authorties at the UVA Health System said that five patients were in critical condition, four in serious condition, six in fair and four in good condition. Hopefully, they pull through. Two Virginia State Patrol troopers died in a helicopter crash while \"assisting public safety resources\" during the riot.\n\n5. Her friends and family plan to hold a tribute to Heather on August 13. In the wake of her tragic death, Heather's friend Felicia, along with her heartbroken friends, plan to hold a candlelight vigil for Heather at Emancipation Park at 7:00 PM ET. Other friends are encouraging people across the country to stand outside their homes at 10:00 PM ET with candles as both a demonstration against racism and in support of Heather.\n\nOur thoughts go out to Heather's family during their time of loss.", "time": "13:34:00"}

Police said Lt. H. Jay Cullen of Midlothian and Trooper-pilot Berke M.M.

The suspect has been charged with one count of second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count of failure to prevent a hit-and-run incident.\n\nAlthough police have not disclosed any details concerning the prime suspect's identity, media reported that he was the owner of the grey Dodge Challenger, a vehicle that was filmed by the witnesses speeding up and plowing into the crowd of anti-fascist protesters who flocked to downtown Charlottesville on Saturday to oppose a large far-right rally there.\n\nAlbemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail Superintendent Martin Kumer told the media that the man was refused bail and is due to appear before Charlottesville General District Court on Monday.\n\nFields is said to be a resident of Maumee, a suburb with 14,000 inhabitants in Lucas County, Ohio, some 10 miles southwest of Toledo.\n\nA car certificate leaked to the media shows that James Alex Fields, Jr. has been owner of the vehicle since March 2016.\n\nAn image allegedly taken from the suspect's Facebook account, since deleted, has circulated on social media.\n\nThere have also been unconfirmed reports in the media that Fields was a US Army serviceman for a brief period in 2015.\n\nREAD MORE: 'It was an intentional attack': Eyewitness describes deadly Charlottesville car plowing incident\n\nImages shared by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) purportedly show the suspect among the members of Vanguard America, a white nationalist organization based in Charlottesville.\n\nHowever, the group denied Fields' membership in a statement, saying that the shields and white shirts \"do not denote the membership.\"\n\nThe mother of the suspect, Samantha Bloom, came forward and spoke to the media, saying that she knew her son was going to the rally in Charlottesville.\n\nShe added that she had urged him to be \"careful\" and rally peacefully in a brief interview with The Blade, a local Toledo, Ohio newspaper. The woman, who lives separately from her son, said she thought that the rally \"had something to do with Trump.\"\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed in the collision while crossing the road, while 19 other people were injured, five critically.\n\nThe people on the scene were reportedly taking part in the anti-fascist demonstration against the \"Unite the Right\" rally of \"alt-Right\" protesters, including the white nationalists.\n\nSaturday's Unite the Right demonstration was greenlighted by the authorities as a rally against the removal of confederate general Robert E. Lee monument from a local park. However, tensions flared up quickly after counter-protesters faced off with the far-right crowd.\n\nUS President Donald Trump condemned the violence, saying that \"the hate and the division must stop right now,\" while seemingly holding \"many sides\" responsible for the violence. Meanwhile, Virginia State Governor Terry R. McAuliffe put the blame on \"white supremacists\" and \"Nazis\" for provoking the unrest.\n\n\"Our message is plain and simple: Go home. You are not wanted in this great Commonwealth. Shame on you,\" McAuliffe told a press conference on Saturday.\n\nThree people were arrested and charged with various minor offenses late Saturday evening in connection with the Charlottesville clashes.\n\nTroy Dungigan, 21, from Tennessee, was placed in custody and charged with disorderly conduct. Another young man, Jacob L. Smith, also 21, from Virginia, faces misdemeanor assault and battery charges. James M. O'Brien, 44, a resident of Florida, was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon, Virginia State Police said in a statement.\n\nRussian citizens have been advised to stay away from Charlottesville until order in the city is completely restored and the state of emergency introduced in the wake of the clashes lifted, the Russian Embassy in Washington said in an warning issued late on Saturday.", "time": "13:40:00"}

He also was charged with three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit-and-run.\n\nCorrea said she recently was swamped with medical bills after complications related to her multiple sclerosis, so she went to a Charlottesville law firm.

When Correa heard Heyer had been killed Saturday, she said she wanted to help her family, just like their daughter helped her a few months ago.\n\nHeyer was a \"young white woman who died standing up not just for people of color in general but, also the people of color that I love, that I worry about,\" Correa said.\n\n\"She died for a reason.

Ohio poses for a mugshot after he allegedly drove his car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one and injuring multiple others. Handout/Getty Images hide caption\n\nA man who appeared to be marching Saturday with a group of self-proclaimed fascists and had, a day earlier, texted his mother to say he had dropped off his cat for her to watch, is accused of killing a woman and injuring multiple others by driving his car into a crowd of marchers.\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr., 20, sped his silver Dodge Challenger into a crowd of people who had been protesting the assembly of white nationalists, white supremacists, fascists and others, according to police.\n\nThe horrific, albeit brief, attack can be seen from multiple angles via video captured by journalists and marchers, and shared on social media.\n\nThree people killed on Saturday\n\nSuddenly and without warning, a car speeds down Fourth St. SE in Charlottesville, Va., ramming into pedestrians with an audible thud and striking another vehicle from behind, sending people flying through the air and over another car near the intersection of Water St. E. The struck vehicle hits a minivan ahead, sending that vehicle into more pedestrians. Seconds later, the car allegedly driven by Fields Jr., reverses on Fourth St., its front bumper dragging as people who avoided the initial attack chase after the retreating car.\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed, according to The Associated Press. Her name has not been officially released.\n\nTwo Virginia State Police officers investigating the day's events died when the helicopter they were in crashed in Albemarie County, where Charlottesville is located, according to the Charlottesville Police Department. The men, identified as Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates, died at the scene of the crash, according to CPD.\n\nWho is the suspect?\n\nFields Jr., who has been charged with second-degree murder among other charges, recently moved to Ohio from where he grew up in Kentucky, his mother, Samantha Bloom, told the AP. She said she knew he was attending a rally in Virginia, but that she didn't know it was a white supremacist rally.\n\n\"I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist,\" said Bloom, who became visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally.\n\n\"He had an African-American friend so ...,\" she said before her voice trailed off. She added that she'd be surprised if her son's views were that far right, according to the AP.\n\nBloom told a reporter with the Toledo Blade that she didn't speak with her son about his political views, and that she wasn't aware of his ties to white supremacist groups. She said her son had dropped of his cat for her to tend to while he attended Saturday's rally.\n\nSuspect appears to march with fascist group\n\nIn a photo posted to Twitter by the Anti-Defamation League and reported by BuzzFeed, a man who appears to be Fields Jr. can be seen brandishing a black shield handed out by the self-proclaimed fascist group Vanguard America.\n\nThe group released a statement on Twitter late Saturday evening saying Fields Jr. was \"in no way, a member of Vanguard America.\" It went on to say the shields were handed out freely to anybody in attendance.\n\nFields Jr. has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and one count related to leaving the scene of the wreck, according to the AP. He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced late Saturday that federal authorities will pursue a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash. Investigators want to know if Fields Jr. crossed state lines with the intent to commit violence, NPR's Carrie Johnson told our Newscast Unit.", "time": "11:34:00"}

allegedly plowed into a group of people protesting a white nationalist rally Saturday in Virginia said she knew her son was attending a rally -- but she thought it was a rally for President Trump, not for white nationalists.\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr, 20, was arrested on Saturday and charged with second-degree murder after he allegedly killed a 32-year-old woman, who was crossing the street, when he rammed his Dodge Challenger into a crowd of anti-fascists at a white nationalist rally.\n\nHis mother, Samantha Bloom, said in an interview Friday night: 'I just knew he was going to a rally. I mean, I try to stay out of his political views. You know, we don't, I don't really get too involved, I moved him out to his own apartment, so I'm watching his cat.'\n\nBloom was informed during the interview by an AP reporter that the rally was indeed organized by white nationalists. 'I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist,' she said.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nSamantha Bloom (right), the mother of James Fields (left), 20, who is accused of killing a woman and injuring 19 others after plowing into a crowd of people in Virginia, said she told her son to rally 'peacefully'\n\nHorrifying video from the scene of the attack showed the silver muscle car speeding towards a group of fleeing anti-fascist protesters\n\nIn an interview with The Toledo Blade, Bloom said that her son texted her Friday to say he had dropped his cat off at her apartment so he could go to an 'alt-right' rally in Virginia.\n\n'I told him to be careful,' Bloom said. '[And] if they're going to rally to make sure he's doing it peacefully.'\n\nShe had returned from dinner Saturday evening unaware that her son was involved and had not yet been contacted by police.\n\nHe told her about the rally last week, but didn't offer details about it. 'I thought it had something to do with Trump,' she said.\n\nFields is being held at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail without bail\n\nBloom said she was surprised with the deadly outcome. 'Yeah, that he would run his car into a group of people for... I'm really not clear on...'\n\nWhen pressed by the reporter about what Bloom was told by her son, it does appear that he had indicated it was an alt-right gathering.\n\n'Like I said, I don't really talk to him about his political views,' she said. 'He just -- so I don't really understand what the rally was about or anything, so... I just know there was -- he did mention it was 'albright'?'\n\nThe reporter then interrupts her, asking, 'Alt-right?'\n\nBloom responds: 'Albright'\n\nThe reporter then corrects her, saying: 'No, alt-right. It's like alternative right.'\n\nBloom said she and her son had just moved to the Toledo area from the northern Kentucky city of Florence. She said that's where Fields grew up. She relocated to Ohio for work.\n\nFields is being held at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail.\n\nShortly after Fields was charged, the FBI and federal prosecutors announced a civil rights investigation, following Texas Sen Ted Cruz's call for the Justice Department to launch a 'domestic terrorism' probe into the deadly crash.\n\nThe FBI's Richmond field office, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and US Attorney's Office for the Western District of Virginia said they have opened an investigation into the circumstances of the incident.\n\nVideo of the Dodge Challenger, which is registered to Fields, showed the driver accelerating into the crowd throwing bodies into the air as people scream before reversing at high speed.\n\nThe incident killed a 32-year-old woman, whose identity has not been released by authorities pending her family's notification.\n\nPhotos of Fields (far left with glasses) at the march showed him marching with racist right-wing group Vanguard America\n\nWitnesses his car (pictured) was traveling up to 40mph when it hit and reversed before ramming into the crowd again and speeding off with someone's shoe attached to its bumper\n\nFields was apprehended and arrested a few blocks away from the bloody scene.\n\nAccording to the jail's superintendent, Martin Kumer, Fields was also booked on suspicion of malicious wounding, failure to stop for an accident involving a death, and hit and run.\n\nKumer said Fields is being held without bail and is scheduled to be arraigned Monday.\n\nThe deadly crash came after violent clashes erupted as hundreds of white supremacists including armed militias marched into Charlottesville sparking violent confrontations with counter-protesters.\n\nPolice cleared the scene with tear gas but the violence continued. Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said a total of 35 people had been treated for injuries, 14 of those were from individual engagements on the streets.\n\nHorrifying video from the scene of the attack showed the silver muscle car speeding towards a group of fleeing anti-fascist protesters.\n\nSeveral residents gathered on Saturday night to hold a candlelight vigil for the woman who was tragically killed and the 19 others who were injured\n\nPhotos showed candles spread out near the scene where the woman was killed as the mourners joined hands in a circle\n\nAnother clip showed the vehicle ramming into the crowd at high speed and victims crying out in pain as they desperately sought medical help.\n\nWitnesses said the car was traveling up to 40mph when it hit and reversed before ramming into the crowd again and speeding off with someone's shoe attached to its bumper.\n\nVirginia Gov Terry McAuliffe strongly condemned all of the so-called 'patriotic' white nationalists during a press conference Saturday evening.\n\n'Go home. You are not wanted in this great commonwealth,' McAuliffe proclaimed. 'You are not patriots. You came here today to hurt people and that is not patriotic,' McAuliffe added.\n\nPresident Donald Trump admonished the day's tragic events, saying in a press conference: 'We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, violence, on many sides... The hate and division must stop, and must stop right now.'\n\nSeveral residents gathered on Saturday night to hold a candlelight vigil for the woman who was tragically killed and the 19 others who were injured.\n\nPhotos showed candles spread out near the scene where the woman was killed as the mourners joined hands in a circle.", "time": "05:52:00"}

Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday after he smashed a car into a line of cars in an episode that left a 32-year-old woman dead and injured at least 19 other people who were protesting a rally staged by white nationalists.\n\n-- Fields, 20, was born in Kenton, Kentucky, to Samantha Lea Bloom.\n\n-- He was living with his mother until \"five or six months ago\" when he moved to his own apartment in Maumee, Ohio, according to an interview that Bloom gave to The Toledo Blade. They moved to Ohio from Kentucky about a year ago because of her job, she said.\n\nRELATED: The statue at the center of Charlottesville's storm\n\nRELATED: Governor defends police response to violence in Charlottesville\n\n-- Fields' father died before he was born, an aunt, Pam Fields, said on Sunday.\n\n-- Pam Fields said she had not seen her nephew, whom she remembered as a \"very quiet little boy\" more than five times in the past 10 years.\n\n-- Military records show that James Alex Fields Jr. entered the Army on Aug. 18, 2015, around the time his mother wrote on Facebook that he had left for boot camp. Less than four months later, on Dec. 11, his period of active duty concluded. It was not immediately clear why he left the military.\n\n-- A photographer saw James Alex Fields Jr. on Saturday with symbols of Vanguard America, a group whose manifesto declares that \"a government based in the natural law must not cater to the false notion of equality.\" The organization denied any ties to him.\n\n\"The driver of the vehicle that hit counterprotesters today was, in no way, a member of Vanguard America,\" the group said in a statement on its Twitter account. \"All our members had been safely evacuated by the time of the incident. The shields seen do not denote membership, nor does the white shirt. The shirts were freely handed out to anyone in attendance.\"\n\n-- Fields was driving a Dodge Challenger \"at a high rate of speed\" in downtown Charlottesville at about 1:45 p.m., a spokeswoman for the city said in a statement. He drove the car into a sedan, which hit a minivan that was in front of it.\n\nThe impact of the crash pushed the sedan and the minivan into a crowd of pedestrians.

Sullivan said the public institution of higher learning would always uphold the right to free speech, but she added that she would \"strongly condemn the unprovoked assault on members of our community, including University personnel who were attempting to maintain order... The violence displayed on Grounds is intolerable and is entirely inconsistent with the University's values.\"\n\nHundreds of people threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays. Some came prepared for a fight, with body armor and helmets. Videos that ricocheted around the world on social media showed people beating each other with sticks and shields.\n\nVirginia State Police said in a tweet Saturday night that three additional men had been arrested in connection with the violence in Charlottesville. Two of the suspects were from out of state, one of whom was charged with carrying a concealed handgun.\n\nPresident Trump urged restraint amid the violence, saying: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides.\"\n\nBut Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer appeared to suggest that Mr. Trump himself should shoulder some of the blame for the nation's tense racial climate.\n\n\"The tide of hatred and intolerance and bigotry that has come to us and has marched down with torches the lawn of one of the founding fathers -- it is brought here by people who belong in the trash heap of history with these ideas,\" Signer said. \"There is a very sad and regrettable coarseness in our politics.\"\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who declared a state of emergency this weekend, told the supremacists, many who came from out of town, to go home.\n\n\"You are not wanted in this great commonwealth. Shame on you,\" he said.\n\nOn Saturday night, Senator's Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman from suspect Fields' home state of Ohio, both tweeted that the incident should be considered domestic terrorism.\n\nAt least six Republican senators, including Portman, have referred to Fields' alleged attack as \"domestic terrorism.\" Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colorado), leader of the National Republican Senatorial Committee in 2018, called on Mr. Trump to do the same.\n\nWith pressure mounting over Mr. Trump's response, a White House spokesman released a statement Sunday morning claiming the president had said, \"very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred, and of course that includes white supremacists, KKK, neo-nazi, and all extremists groups.\"\n\nPresident Trump's daughter Ivanka, a senior aide to his administration, tweeted early on Sunday morning that \"racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis\" have \"no place\" in American society, and she urged the county to \"come together as Americans -- and be one country UNITED.\"", "time": "17:14:00"}

(CNN) -- The 32-year old woman killed in Charlottesville on Saturday (Aug. 12) has been identified as Heather Heyer, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe said Sunday (Aug. 13).\n\nHeyer was killed after a car rammed into a crowd of demonstrators protesting against white supremacists.\n\nShortly before the attack Saturday, fistfights and screaming matches erupted between counterprotesters and white nationalists protesting the removal of a confederate monument. The clashes led to the cancellation of scheduled protests, sending demonstrators from both sides marching on nearby streets. A few hours later, a car slammed into a throng of counterprotesters.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nWhat happened?\n\nCounterprotesters met white nationalists and other right-wing groups at the site of Saturday's \"Unite the Right\" event hours before the rally was set to start.\n\nClashes broke out and police began to disperse crowds.\n\nLocal officials declared the rally an \"unlawful assembly\" and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency.\n\nAbout two hours later, a gray Dodge Challenger rammed into a crowd of counterprotesters walking down a street in downtown Charlottesville.\n\nThe driver slammed the car in reverse at high speed and left the site of the crash. He was arrested later that afternoon.\n\nThe victims\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed in the car-ramming incident, Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said.\n\nA total of 19 others were also hurt, including five people still in critical condition Sunday, a spokeswoman for the University of Virginia Medical Center said.\n\nTwo Virginia State Patrol troopers died when a helicopter crashed in a wooded area near Charlottesville after monitoring Saturday's events. The pilot, Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Trooper Berke M.M. Bates, who would have turned 41 on Sunday, were killed. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash.\n\nCity officials say at least 15 others were wounded in events associated with the scheduled rally.\n\nThe suspect\n\nThe driver, James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, is being held at a Virginia jail on suspicion of second-degree murder, malicious wounding and failure to stop in an accident that resulted in death, said Superintendent Martin Kumer with the Albermarle-Charlottesville County Regional Jail.\n\nFields' mother, Samantha Bloom, told CNN affiliate Toledo Blade, her son told her last week he was going to an \"alt-right\" rally, but she was not involved in his political views. CNN's attempts to reach Bloom were unsuccessful.\n\nThe Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have launched a civil rights investigation into the deadly crash.\n\nThree other men were arrested Saturday. One of them faces a charge of carrying a concealed handgun and the other is charged disorderly conduct. The third man, originally from Virginia, was arrested on suspicion of assault and battery.\n\nThe investigation\n\nFederal authorities launched a civil rights investigation hours after the incident.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said US Attorney Rick Mountcastle is leading the investigation.\n\n\"The violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated,\" Sessions said in a statement. \"Justice will prevail.\"", "time": "15:25:00"}

nationalists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville.\n\nShortly before the attack Saturday, fistfights and screaming matches erupted between counterprotesters and white nationalists protesting the removal of a confederate monument. The clashes led to the cancellation of scheduled protests, sending demonstrators from both sides marching on nearby streets. A few hours later, a car slammed into a throng of counterprotesters.\n\nCounterprotesters met white nationalists and other right-wing groups at the site of Saturday's event hours before the rally was set to start.\n\nClashes broke out and police began to disperse crowds.\n\nLocal officials declared the rally an \"unlawful assembly\" and Virginia Gov. McAuliffe declared a state of emergency to aid in the state's response to the violence.\n\nAbout two hours later, a gray Dodge Challenger rammed into a crowd of counterprotesters walking down a narrow side street in downtown Charlottesville.\n\nThe Dodge driver slammed the car in reverse at a high speed and left the site of the crash. He was arrested later that afternoon.\n\nThe victims\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed in the car-ramming incident Saturday, Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said.\n\nA total of 19 others were also hurt, including five people still in critical condition Saturday, a spokeswoman for the University of Virginia Medical Center said.\n\nTwo Virginia State Patrol troopers died when a helicopter crashed in a wooded area near Charlottesville after monitoring Saturday's events. The pilot, Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Trooper Berke M.M. Bates, who would have turned 41 on Sunday, were killed. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash.\n\nCity officials say at least 15 others were wounded in events associated with the scheduled rally.\n\nThe suspect\n\nThe driver, James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, is being held at a Virginia jail on suspicion of second-degree murder, malicious wounding and failure to stop in an accident that resulted in death, said Superintendent Martin Kumer with the Albermarle-Charlottesville County Regional Jail.\n\nFields' mother, Samantha Bloom, told CNN affiliate Toledo Blade, her son told her last week he was going to an \"alt-right\" rally, but she was not involved in his political views. CNN's attempt to reach Bloom were unsuccessful.\n\nThe Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigations have launched a civil rights investigation into the deadly crash.\n\nThree other men were arrested Saturday. One of them faces a charge of carrying a concealed handgun and the other is charged disorderly conduct. The third man, originally from Virginia, was arrested on suspicion of assault and battery.", "time": "10:01:00"}

be marching Saturday with a group of self-proclaimed fascists and had, a day earlier, texted his mother to say he had dropped off his cat for her to watch, is accused of killing a woman and injuring multiple others by driving his car into a crowd of marchers.\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr., 20, sped his silver Dodge Challenger into a crowd of people who had been protesting the assembly of white nationalists, white supremacists, fascists and others, according to police.\n\nThe horrific, albeit brief, attack can be seen from multiple angles via video captured by journalists and marchers, and shared on social media.\n\nThree people killed on Saturday\n\nSuddenly and without warning, a car speeds down Fourth St. SE in Charlottesville, Va., ramming into pedestrians with an audible thud and striking another vehicle from behind, sending people flying through the air and over another car near the intersection of Water St. E. The struck vehicle hits a minivan ahead, sending that vehicle into more pedestrians. Seconds later, the car allegedly driven by Fields Jr., reverses on Fourth St., its front bumper dragging as people who avoided the initial attack chase after the retreating car.\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed, according to The Associated Press. Her name has not been officially released.\n\nTwo Virginia State Police officers investigating the day's events died when the helicopter they were in crashed in Albemarie County, where Charlottesville is located, according to the Charlottesville Police Department. The men, identified as Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates, died at the scene of the crash, according to CPD.\n\nWho is the suspect?\n\nFields Jr., who has been charged with second-degree murder among other charges, recently moved to Ohio from where he grew up in Kentucky, his mother, Samantha Bloom, told the AP. She said she knew he was attending a rally in Virginia, but that she didn't know it was a white supremacist rally.\n\n\"I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist,\" said Bloom, who became visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally.\n\n\"He had an African-American friend so ...,\" she said before her voice trailed off. She added that she'd be surprised if her son's views were that far right, according to the AP.\n\nBloom told a reporter with the Toledo Blade that she didn't speak with her son about his political views, and that she wasn't aware of his ties to white supremacist groups. She said her son had dropped of his cat for her to tend to while he attended Saturday's rally.\n\nSuspect appears to march with fascist group\n\nIn a photo posted to Twitter by the Anti-Defamation League and reported by BuzzFeed, a man who appears to be Fields Jr. can be seen brandishing a black shield handed out by the self-proclaimed fascist group Vanguard America.\n\nThe group released a statement on Twitter late Saturday evening saying Fields Jr. was \"in no way, a member of Vanguard America.\" It went on to say the shields were handed out freely to anybody in attendance.\n\nFields Jr. has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and one count related to leaving the scene of the wreck, according to the AP. He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced late Saturday that federal authorities will pursue a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash.

She was only 32 and was killed while crossing the street during the protests, taking a stand against racism and hate. The counter protesters, carrying LGBTQ flags and Black Lives Matter signs, were demonstrating against a group of alt-right who had rallied together to protest the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue. The night before, the alt-right group had carried torches in protest, ramping up the tensions in the area.\n\nHeyer was tragically caught in the middle of one driver's unexpected turn toward violence. Now, her supporters are asking everyone to light a candle and stand outside their home in her honor, showing they are standing against hate on Sunday night at 10 p.m. Eastern.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nHeather Heyer was part of the counter protest group that was hit by the Ohio driver, while taking a stand against hate. She is a native of Greene County and graduated from William Monroe High School. She was a paralegal, International Business Times reported. According to her LinkedIn, she worked for Miller Law Group PC in Virginia as a legal assistant. She died doing what she believed in: speaking out against injustice, racism, and hate.\n\nShe was a Bernie supporter in 2016 and was open about those political views on her Facebook wall.\n\nAccording to witnesses, the counter protesters were hit as they turned a corner during their protest march. They were chanting things like \"our streets\" in response to the words \"Unite the Right.\" This happened after police had dispersed a group of white nationalists, CBS reported.\n\nWitnesses referred to the crash as a \"deliberate act of terrorism,\" which the Charlottesville Police Chief echoed in his press conference that you can watch below:\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe had declared a state of emergency in the city because of violence that was breaking out. In fact, a group of white nationalists had just been dispersed shortly before the car rammed into the counter protesters, many of whom were carrying LBTQ flags and Black Lives Matters signs.\n\nLater, many public officials spoke out against any white supremacists who were involved in the rally.\n\nAlt-right demonstrators were protesting the city's decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park.\n\nFriends of Heyer's family have set up a GoFundMe to help them during this terrible time. You can donate here. As of the time of publication, $26,002 was raised of a $50,000 goal, with 984 people donating.\n\nOn the GoFundMe, a friend shared:\n\nAs of 7:45 p.m. Eastern, $61,972 had already been contributed toward a $75,000 goal. You can contribute to the GoFundMe here.\n\nHeather Heyer didn't hide who she was or her desire to take a stand against injustice. Even the quote on her Facebook cover photo read: \"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention.\"\n\nShe often posted on Facebook, standing up for others. She shared a video before the election about how if a person was scared of a Muslim, they should meet a Muslim to end those fears.\n\nShe was very outspoken about her beliefs, including posting a review of a police department on Facebook in 2016, upset about a woman that she said had been assaulted.\n\nMany have flocked to Heather's Facebook page to share their grief in her loss and their solidarity to continue taking a stand for her beliefs.\n\nOne person, Michael Bullard, wrote:\n\nWe can't let this be for nothing people. We have to take her spirit of resistance with us wherever we go. Let this be the catalyst in our lives for real change. Rest in peace. We'll take it from here.\"\n\nIn addition to Heather's tragic death, 19 were injured from the crash, with an additional 15 people injured in the rally itself. Later, two more people died in a helicopter crash. As of early Saturday evening, UVA Health System shared that five patients were in critical condition, four in serious condition, six in fair condition, and four more in good condition.\n\nThe suspect, James Alex Fields Jr., is in custody. He was booked and charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, failure to stop for an accident involving a death, and hit-and-run, Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail Superintendent Martin Kumer told The Washington Post. Fields is 20 years old.\n\nFriends and admirers of Heather are urging everyone to stand outside their homes at 10 p.m. Easter on Sunday night (tonight) with lit candles, to show everyone across the world that they oppose racism and they oppose fascism.", "time": "08:35:00"}

anti-racist protesters marching against a white supremacist rally in the US state of Virginia on Saturday.\n\nThe assailant was identified as James Alex Fields, Jr and was charged with second degree murder, one count of hit-and-run, attended failure to stop with injury and three counts of malicious wounding, according to local media reports.\n\nThe incident in Charlottesville killed 32-year-old Heather Heyer, an anti-racist protester, and injured dozens more.\n\nThe alleged attack took place during a march against Saturday's Unite the Right rally, one of the largest white supremacist gatherings in recent US history.\n\nFields' gray Dodge Challenger reportedly slammed into a crowd as hundreds of anti-racist and anti-fascist marchers made their way through downtown Charlottesville.\n\nI just saw multiple bodies fly over car windshields. The black car that did it drove off. This is horror. This is a war zone #DefendCville -- Kim Kelly (@GrimKim)\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nVideo footage of the incident shows bodies flying over cars and others being hurled to the ground by the force of the impact.\n\nThe car reversed, hitting more people, and then drove off.\n\nFields' arrest was announced shortly after the incident.

Trump's not a white supremacist.\"\n\n\"He had an African-American friend so ...,\" she said before trailing off.\n\nAccording to public records published by BuzzFeed, Fields is registered as member of Trump's Republican Party.\n\nSeveral news outlets and social media users captured screenshots of posts from a Facebook account believed to have belonged to Fields. It is neither either deactivated or deleted.\n\nMany of the posts express support for the alt-right, a loosely knit coalition of far right groups that includes white supremacists and neo-Nazis.\n\nPhotos from the now-defunct fb page of the James Fields charged with committing murder today in Charlottesville.

In a statement posted on Twitter, Vanguard America said that Fields was \"in no way\" affiliated with the group and that \"the shields were freely handed out to anyone who was in attendance\".", "time": "14:12:00"}

sped his silver Dodge Challenger into a crowd of people who had been protesting the assembly of white nationalists, white supremacists, fascists and others, according to police.\n\nA 32-year-old resident of Charlottesville, Heather Heyer, was killed, according to authorities.\n\nThe horrific, albeit brief, attack can be seen from multiple angles via video captured by journalists and marchers and shared on social media.\n\nA car suddenly speeds down Fourth Street Southeast, ramming into pedestrians with an audible thud, striking another vehicle from behind and sending people flying through the air and over another car near the intersection with Water Street East. The struck vehicle then hits a minivan ahead, sending that vehicle into more pedestrians. Seconds later, the car allegedly driven by Fields, reverses on Fourth Street, its front bumper dragging as people who avoided the initial attack chase after it.\n\nTwo Virginia State Police troopers investigating the day's events died when the helicopter they were in crashed in Albemarle County, where Charlottesville is located, according to the state police. The men, identified as Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates, 40, died at the scene of the crash, according to the state police.\n\nFields has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and one count related to leaving the scene of the wreck, according to The Associated Press. He is scheduled to appear in court on Monday.\n\nHe recently moved to Ohio from where he grew up in Kentucky, his mother, Samantha Bloom, told the AP. She said she knew he was attending a rally in Virginia but didn't know it was a white supremacist rally.\n\n\"I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a supremacist,\" said Bloom, who became visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and death.\n\n\"He had an African-American friend so ... ,\" she said before her voice trailed off. She added that she would be surprised if her son's views were that far right, according to the AP.\n\nBloom told a reporter with the Toledo Blade that she didn't speak with her son about his political views and that she wasn't aware of his ties to white supremacist groups. She said her son had dropped off his cat for her to take care of while he attended Saturday's rally.\n\nIn a photo posted to Twitter by the Anti-Defamation League and reported by BuzzFeed, a man who appears to be Fields can be seen brandishing a black shield handed out by the self-proclaimed fascist group Vanguard America.\n\nThe group released a statement on Twitter late Saturday evening saying Fields was \"in no way, a member of Vanguard America.\" It said the shields were handed out freely to anybody in attendance.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced late Saturday that federal authorities will pursue a civil rights investigation into the circumstances surrounding the crash.

Martin Kumer, superintendent of the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail, where Fields has been booked.\n\nKumer would neither confirm nor deny whether Fields' charges were related to a car crash that killed a 32-year-old woman and injured 19 others, following an alt-right demonstration in downtown Charlottesville.\n\nThe hit-and-run took place in the middle of the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlotteville, Virginia, which from its beginning devolved into a white supremacist display complete with torches, swastikas, beatings, and racial epithets. Local news outlet The Daily Progress reported that local \"white rights\" organizer Jason Kessler has decried the violence, which began early:\n\nHundreds made their presence known Friday night as their carried torches across UVa Grounds to the Rotunda, which ended in violence and police declaring an unlawful assembly. It echoed a May 13 rally by white nationalists including Richard Spencer, leader of the so-called alt-right movement and a UVa graduate. Kessler was among that group, as well.\n\nThe stated goal of the Unite the Right rally is to defend Southern heritage, spurred by an effort by Charlottesville officials to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from Emancipation Park. The park was renamed from Lee Park as part of a wider effort to retell the city's racial history. Removal of the statue is on hold as a result of a six-month injunction.\n\nHowever, Kessler is reportedly already planning a 19 August 2017 event in Boston.\n\nTwo Virginia State Police were also killed during the rally when their helicopter crashed, which Associated Press reports was connected to the event:\n\nState Police said in a statement that the helicopter was \"assisting public safety resources with the ongoing situation\" when it crashed in a wooded area. The pilot, Lieutenant H. Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.\n\nThe identity of the woman who was killed has not yet been released pending notification of next of kin.", "time": "01:59:00"}

Just 20 years old, Fields' arrest was confirmed by the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail Superintendent, Martin Kumer, and Fields is facing an extensive list of charges.

My message is clear: We are stronger than you. You have made our commonwealth stronger. You will not succeed. There is no place for you here. There is no place for you in America.\"\n\nWhile McAuliffe was unequivocal in his condemnation of white supremacists, President Donald Trump was decidedly softer in his response to the tragedy, refusing to target any specific group in the aftermath of the incident.\n\n\"We condemn in the strongest possible terms,\" said Trump, \"this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides. On many sides.\"\n\nTrump's statement on the incident was roundly criticized, especially after his response to the matter was delayed until Saturday afternoon, half a day after the initial rallies at Charlottesville were taking shape.\n\nIf you saw Trump's statement from Bedminster, it seems \"on many sides\" was an ad-lib and not in his original remarks.

"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Virginia (CNN)One person died when a car plowed into a crowd following a dispersed gathering of white nationalists and counterprotesters in Charlottesville.\n\nShortly before the attack Saturday, fistfights and screaming matches erupted between counterprotesters and white nationalists protesting the removal of a confederate monument. The clashes led to the cancellation of scheduled protests, sending demonstrators from both sides marching on nearby streets. A few hours later, a car slammed into a throng of counterprotesters.Here's what we know:What happened?Counterprotesters met white nationalists and other right-wing groups at the site of Saturday's event hours before the rally was set to start.Clashes broke out and police began to disperse crowds.Local officials declared the rally an \"unlawful assembly\" and Virginia Gov. McAuliffe declared a state of emergency to aid in the state's response to the violence. About two hours later, a gray Dodge Challenger rammed into a crowd of counterprotesters walking down a narrow side street in downtown Charlottesville.The Dodge driver slammed the car in reverse at a high speed and left the site of the crash. He was arrested later that afternoon.Read MoreThe victimsA 32-year-old woman was killed in the car-ramming incident Saturday, Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said. A total of 19 others were also hurt, including five people still in critical condition Saturday, a spokeswoman for the University of Virginia Medical Center said.Two Virginia State Patrol troopers died when a helicopter crashed in a wooded area near Charlottesville after monitoring Saturday's events. The pilot, Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Trooper Berke M.M. Bates, who would have turned 41 on Sunday, were killed. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash.City officials say at least 15 others were wounded in events associated with the scheduled rally.The suspectThe driver, James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, is being held at a Virginia jail on suspicion of second-degree murder, malicious wounding and failure to stop in an accident that resulted in death, said Superintendent Martin Kumer with the Albermarle-Charlottesville County Regional Jail.Fields' mother, Samantha Bloom, told CNN affiliate Toledo Blade, her son told her last week he was going to an \"alt-right\" rally, but she was not involved in his political views. CNN's attempt to reach Bloom were unsuccessful.The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigations have launched a civil rights investigation into the deadly crash.Three other men were arrested Saturday. One of them faces a charge of carrying a concealed handgun and the other is charged disorderly conduct.

Maumee is a suburb of Toledo, about 70 miles southwest of Detroit.\n\nOfficials: White nationalist rally linked to 3 deaths\n\nFields told his mother, Samantha Bloom, that he was planning to attend an alt-right rally, according to The Blade of Toledo.\n\n\"I try to stay out of his political views. I don't get too involved,\" she said.\n\n\"I told him to be careful ... if they are going to rally, to make sure he is doing it peacefully,\" she said.\n\nVideos by bystanders captured parts of the vehicle's swift acceleration into a crowd that was protesting a rally of white national and other right-wing groups. Some of those in the white national groups carried shields adorned with a version of the Detroit Red Wings logo.\n\nThe vehicle registered to Fields, a gray Dodge Challenger, was stopped in the roadway moments before it sped off. After the collisions, it backed out the way it came. Fields was arrested a short time later.\n\nAccording to a report in the Washington Post, Fields' father was killed by a drunk driver before his birth and he was raised by his mother in Northern Kentucky. The Post attributed the information to an uncle of Fields who wished to remain anonymous.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what brought him to Northwest Ohio or when he arrived. Fields is expected to be arraigned on multiple charges on Monday.\n\n.\n\n1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2w03uuZ", "time": "04:04:00"}

McAuliffe declared a state of emergency to aid in the state's response to the violence.\n\nAbout two hours later, a gray Dodge Challenger rammed into a crowd of counterprotesters walking down a narrow side street in downtown Charlottesville.\n\nThe Dodge driver slammed the car in reverse at a high speed and left the site of the crash. He was arrested later that afternoon.\n\nThe victims\n\nA 32-year-old woman was killed in the car-ramming incident Saturday, Charlottesville Police Chief Al Thomas said.\n\nA total of 19 others were also hurt, including five people still in critical condition Saturday, a spokeswoman for the University of Virginia Medical Center said.\n\nTwo Virginia State Patrol troopers died when a helicopter crashed in a wooded area near Charlottesville after monitoring Saturday's events. The pilot, Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Trooper Berke M.M. Bates, who would have turned 41 on Sunday, were killed. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash.\n\nCity officials say at least 15 others were wounded in events associated with the scheduled rally.\n\nThe suspect\n\nThe driver, James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, is being held at a Virginia jail on suspicion of second-degree murder, malicious wounding and failure to stop in an accident that resulted in death, said Superintendent Martin Kumer with the Albermarle-Charlottesville County Regional Jail.\n\nFields' mother, Samantha Bloom, told CNN affiliate Toledo Blade, her son told her last week he was going to an \"alt-right\" rally, but she was not involved in his political views. CNN's attempt to reach Bloom were unsuccessful.\n\nThe Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigations have launched a civil rights investigation into the deadly crash.\n\nThree other men were arrested Saturday. One of them faces a charge of carrying a concealed handgun and the other is charged disorderly conduct. The third man, originally from Virginia, was arrested on suspicion of assault and battery.", "time": "09:45:00"}

She confirmed with the Toledo Blade Saturday night Fields lived with her and moved to northwest Ohio about six months ago for a job.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Fields enlisted in the U.S. Army on Aug. 18, 2015, but his enlistment was terminated four months later, on December 11 for unclear reasons.\n\nBloom told The Blade she knew Fields was planning on going to an alt-right protest and that it \"had something to do with Trump,\" but didn't know about its extremist nature.\n\nJames Fields was seen at Saturday's demonstration with Vanguard of America, a national white supremacist organization. The group has distanced itself from Fields, saying he is not an official member.\n\nCondemnation from Washington\n\nThe attack drew bipartisan scorn from politicians condemning the white supremacist movement. Sens.

Ted Cruz of Texas, a former solicitor general, demanded the assailant be prosecuted for domestic terrorism by the Department of Justice.\n\n\"The Nazis, the KKK and white supremacists are repulsive and evil and all of us have a moral obligation to speak out against lies, bigotry, anti-semitism and hatred they propagate,\" Cruz said in a written statement.\n\nPresident's remarks criticized as insufficient\n\nAfter days of combative interactions with North Korea, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and news outlets, President Donald Trump briefly addressed the attack during a bill signing at his New Jersey golf club, but did not condemn the white supremacists or alt-right groups, saying there is \"hatred and bigotry on both sides.\"\n\nThe president is taking heat for being too vague and not denouncing extremists groups by name -- potentially painting a false equivalency between the white nationalists and counter-protesters.\n\n\"Mr. President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists,\" Republican Sen. Corey Gardner of Colorado tweeted.\n\nPresident Trump did not single out alt-right demonstrators, which included David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader that endorsed Trump's presidential campaign and white supremacist Richard Spencer for their ideology.\n\n\"These groups are corrupting our country's greatness,\" Ohio Gov. John Kasich said. \"America can and must be better.\"\n\nHow did all this happen?\n\nViolence erupted after white nationalists marched on the University of Virginia's Emancipation Park by torchlight Friday night.\n\nThe \"Unite the Right\" rally protested the planned removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee from the park in addition to a list of other ideological grievances typically associated with the alt-right.\n\nAfter white nationalists had violent clashes with counter-protesters in the run-up to a second Saturday rally. The University of Virginia instructed students to shelter in place and Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency.\n\nA car mowed through pedestrians on the streets of Charlottesville, killing one and injuring at least 19 others -- echoing the tactics used by Islamic terrorists in Europe.\n\nDuring an afternoon press conference, McAuliffe confirmed there had been three fatalities, one of which was 32-year-old Heather Heyer, who was killed in the crash. Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer confirmed the victim's identity Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" Heyer was a legal assistant at Miller Law Group in Charlottesville. It is unclear if she was involved in the protests.\n\nA police helicopter crash killed Pilot Lt. H. Jay Cullen, 48, and Trooper-Pilot Berke M.M. Bates, 40. The two officers were monitoring the violence on the ground, according to Virginia State Police.\n\nWhat is alt-right?\n\nTerms like \"alt-right\" and \"white nationalism\" can be tricky due to their loaded nature and definitions can vary depending on who you are.\n\nThe Associated Press Style Guide defines the \"alt-right\" as an ideology that emphasizes preserving the white race while carrying typical conservative values such as limited government, lower taxes and strict law-and-order.", "time": "16:25:00"}

murder after allegedly ramming his car into a group of peaceful anti-Nazi protesters, killing one person and injuring 19 others. And at least one prominent Republican -- Texas Sen. Ted Cruz -- thinks that murder charge should be upgraded to a terrorism charge.\n\nFields, Jr. was charged with second-degree murder and three counts of malicious wounding and is currently being held without bail at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail in Charlottesville, VA.\n\nA 32-year-old woman, who has not yet been publicly identified, was killed after Fields, Jr. allegedly drove a 2010 gray Dodge Challenger into the crowd of people protesting the white supremacists, before putting the car in reverse and hitting more people. At least 5 victims are currently in critical condition, according to the Washington Post. Two Virginia State Police officers also died after their helicopter crashed nearby while monitoring the protests.\n\nFields' mother, Samantha Bloom, told the Toledo Blade her son had dropped his cat off with her so that he could attend an \"alt-right\" rally. \"I told him to be careful,\" she told the paper \"[And] if they're going to rally to make sure he's doing it peacefully.\"\n\nNBC News: James Alex Fields Jr., age 20, has been charged with second degree murder in connection with the car ramming in Charlottesvile. pic.twitter.com/XW6oIXcC6r\n\n-- Tom Winter (@Tom_Winter) August 13, 2017\n\nPresident Trump briefly addressed the attack during a bill signing ceremony at his golf club in New Jersey (where he is currently on vacation), but declined to condemn the white supremacists, saying only that there is \"hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides.\" Trump also sent his \"condolences\" to the family of the woman who was killed, his \"best wishes\" to those who were injured, and described the murder as, \"So sad!\"\n\nCondolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!\n\n-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2017\n\nThe moral equivalency in Trump's response drew bipartisan scorn from politicians condemning the white supremacist movement. Sen. Ted Cruz, a former solicitor general, even went so far Saturday night as to demand that the perpetrator be prosecuted for domestic terrorism by the Department of Justice.\n\n\"The Nazis, the KKK, and white supremacists are repulsive and evil, and all of us have a moral obligation to speak out against the lies, bigotry, anti-semitism, and hatred that they propagate,\" Cruz said in a statement. \"Having watched the horrifying video of the car deliberately crashing into a crowd of protesters, I urge the Department of Justice to immediately investigate and prosecute this grotesque act of domestic terrorism.\"\n\nAn hour later, the Department of Justice announced it will open a federal civil rights investigation into the \"violence and deaths in Charlottesville,\" in a statement that made no reference to terrorism.\n\n\"When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated. I have talked with FBI Director Chris Wray, FBI agents on the scene, and law enforcement officials for the state of Virginia. The FBI has been supporting state and local authorities throughout the day.

It happened during a white nationalist rally in the city. (Aug. 12) AP\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nA former Boone County High School classmate and two former neighbors of James Alex Fields Jr., the man accused of killing one and injuring 19 Saturday in Charlottesville, Virgina, described him as shy and a \"gentle giant.\"\n\n\"I can distinctly remember seeing him at school, I remember speaking to him in passing. I do not remember a single detail of any conversation, other than thinking that he occupied the 'gentle giant' role in my mind,\" wrote Tanner Coleman in a blog post. \"I seem to remember him being a very quiet guy who, when spoken to, was kind and shy.\"\n\nFields and his mother, Samantha Bloom, 49, lived for 10 years in an apartment complex off Pleasant Valley Road near U.S. 42 in southwest Florence, Kentucky.\n\nMore: Ohio man charged in Charlottesville vehicle attack grew up in NKY\n\nKathy Scott, a resident of the complex, described Bloom as a \"delightful lady\" who she would often see around the complex in a wheelchair.\n\n\"I saw him quite a bit,\" Scott said of Fields. \"Going to the bus and using his bicycle. But he was just shy. (Bloom) was very sociable. She went to the big church down the street called Crossroads.\"\n\nAnother former neighbor, Yvette Lovensheiner, 77, learned Fields was a suspect when reporters visited Sunday morning.\n\n\"Oh for Jesus's sake. He was just going into the service,\" Lovensheiner said. \"What happened? He used to help me with my buckets because I cleaned houses.\"\n\nCommunity mourns woman killed in Charlottesville attack\n\nIn a Facebook comment on Aug. 17, 2017, Bloom said Fields had just left for boot camp and was \"all grown up.\" The New York Times on Sunday reported Fields entered the Army on Aug. 18, 2015 but left for unknown reasons on Dec. 11, 2015.\n\nFields is being held on suspicion of second-degree murder, malicious wounding and failure to stop in an accident that resulted in death, officials said Saturday. Police say he drove a vehicle -- a 2010 Dodge Challenger purchased in Florence in 2015 -- into a crowd of counter-protesters at the \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, of Charlottesville died as a result of injuries sustained in the incident.\n\n\"I hope they put him where the sun doesn't shine,\" Lovensheiner said of Fields. \"How in the world can you be driven to do something like that?\"\n\nShe did have sympathy for Bloom.\n\n\"I really hate to hear that, for her sake,\" she said about Fields. \"She was a nice lady.\"\n\nColeman, the former classmate, graduated from Randall K. Cooper High School in Union, Kentucky in 2014 -- a year ahead of Fields and he said he barely knew him.\n\n\"And that's the problem,'' Coleman said. He recognized Fields' photograph on televised news programs Saturday.\n\nColeman wrote the blog post, he said Sunday, to \"point out the flaw in today's society where we don't love everyone around us.\"\n\n\"Maybe had I taken a step outside my own circle of friends and made a friend out of the seemingly lonely, quiet kid I saw in the hallways, maybe he wouldn't have killed that person,\" Coleman wrote.\n\nBob Strickley contributed.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2w1ojpE", "time": "16:35:00"}

people protesting against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville was named on Sunday as Heather Heyer, a 32 year old legal assistant with a law firm in Virginia, who repeatedly championed civil rights issues on social media.\n\nHeyer, whose Facebook cover photo read: \"If you're not outraged, you're not paying attention\", worked for the Virginia law firm Miller Law, and regularly drew attention to cases of police malpractice and racism, as well as posting her support for Bernie Sanders in his presidential campaign.\n\nA friend from childhood, Felicia Correa, who launched a crowdfunding page and said she was speaking for Heyer's mother, who was not ready to speak in public, said: \"She died doing what was right. My heart is broken, but I am forever proud of her.\"\n\nHowever, it was testimony to the bitterness of the local situation that among scores of tributes to Heyer's principles and courage, several people posted comments laying equal blame on the anti-racist and civil rights groups as on the neo-Nazi and far right groups whose planned rally they were demonstrating against.\n\nThe crowdfunding page to raise money for her family has already far exceeded its $50,000 target, with almost 3,000 people donating within 11hours, many leaving tributes describing her as a hero. Sheryl Hodge wrote: \"We are so sad and outraged. We will not let Heather go in vain,\" and George Christos: \"Very sad that our country continues to see this hatred and that a young life was lost as a result.\"\n\nHer friends were also organising a candlelit vigil in her memory on Sunday night.\n\nHeyer came from Greene County, one of the smallest counties in Virginia, where she graduated from William Monroe high school - motto \"Every child, every chance, every day\" - and kept in touch with her alumni from the class of 2003. The school was originally founded from money left by William Monroe, an 18th-century immigrant from England, to provide free education for white children, but it now posts a firm commitment on its website against discrimination \"on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age in its programs and activities\".\n\nHeyer's second last Facebook post, in October 2016, was a link to a site urging those fearful of Muslims to meet and befriend one. Since it was still open, hundreds of people added comments to it, most expressing admiration for her and condolences to her family, but a few - who instantly attracted outraged reactions - blamed her for being at the rally.", "time": "16:19:00"}

A spokesperson for University of Virginia Medical Center said early Sunday morning that the hospital was still treating five victims of the incident in critical condition, four in serious and another ten in fair or good condition.\n\nOn Saturday night, the FBI and federal prosecutors announced that a civil rights investigation had been opened into the vehicular death allegedly caused by James Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio.\n\nFields is being held without bail on second-degree murder, malicious wounding and failure to stop at the scene of an accident that resulted in a death, officials said. The civil rights investigation raises the prospect of other charges being filed in the coming days as the investigation continues.\n\nVideo of the incident showed a grey Dodge Charger plowing into counter-protesters who were marching through the city's shopping district. The force of the collision hurled several people into the air. Bystanders could be seen running in every direction while others stood by screaming for help.\n\nNeighbors of Fields have said he lives at an apartment with a woman in a wheelchair and that he drives a silver Dodge like the one used in the incident.\n\nField's mother, Samantha Bloom, told The Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn't know it was a white supremacist rally.\n\n\"I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist,\" said Bloom, who became visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally\n\n\"He had an African-American friend so ...,\" she said before her voice trailed off. She added that she'd be surprised if her son's views were that far right.\n\nHis arrest capped hours of unrest on Sunday as hundreds of white nationalists, neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members clashed with counter-protesters in the historic southern college town.\n\nTensions first began to rise on Friday night, when hundreds of torch-carrying white nationalists marched through the campus of the University of VirginiaU, which was founded by Thomas Jefferson. They were protesting the decision to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a Charlottesville park.\n\nUVA President Teresa A. Sullivan said the public institution of higher learning would always uphold the right to free speech, but she added that she would \"strongly condemn the unprovoked assault on members of our community, including University personnel who were attempting to maintain order... The violence displayed on Grounds is intolerable and is entirely inconsistent with the University's values.\"\n\nHundreds of people threw punches, hurled water bottles and unleashed chemical sprays. Some came prepared for a fight, with body armor and helmets. Videos that ricocheted around the world on social media showed people beating each other with sticks and shields.\n\nVirginia State Police said in a tweet Saturday night that three additional men had been arrested in connection with the violence in Charlottesville. Two of the suspects were from out of state, one of whom was charged with carrying a concealed handgun.\n\nPresident Trump urged restraint amid the violence, saying: \"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides.\"\n\nBut Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer appeared to suggest that Mr. Trump himself should shoulder some of the blame for the nation's tense racial climate.\n\n\"The tide of hatred and intolerance and bigotry that has come to us and has marched down with torches the lawn of one of the founding fathers -- it is brought here by people who belong in the trash heap of history with these ideas,\" Signer said. \"There is a very sad and regrettable coarseness in our politics.\"\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who declared a state of emergency this weekend, told the supremacists, many who came from out of town, to go home.\n\n\"You are not wanted in this great commonwealth. Shame on you,\" he said.\n\nOn Saturday night, Senator's Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman from suspect Fields' home state of Ohio, both tweeted that the incident should be considered domestic terrorism.\n\nAt least six Republican senators, including Portman, have referred to Fields' alleged attack as \"domestic terrorism.\"\n\nPresident Trump's daughter Ivanka, a senior aide to his administration, tweeted early on Sunday morning that \"racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis\" have \"no place\" in American society, and she urged the county to \"come together as Americans -- and be one country UNITED.\"", "time": "13:10:00"}

EPA/BRENNAN GILMORE/HANDOUT HANDOUT EDITORIAL USE ONLY/NO SALES\n\nPolice in the town of Charlottesville, Virginia have on Saturday arrested and charged a man in connection with an incident in which a car drove into a crowd of people protesting against a planned white supremacist rally, leaving at least one person dead and 19 injured.\n\nCharlottesville Police announced that they have arrested and charged 20-year-old Ohio resident James Alex Fields Jr, whom they were holding at Albemarle Regional Jail.\n\nHe has been charged with \"one count of second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and one count of hit and run\", according to a police statement.\n\nFields is accused of deliberately plowing a car into a group of people who were protesting against a white supremacist march, in what local police chief Al Thomas has called a \"premeditated\" and \"unacceptable\" attack.\n\nHe confirmed that a 32 year-old woman had been killed.\n\nFields was detained in the moments following the suspected attack, which occurred at approximately 1pm, shortly after Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe had declared a state of emergency in the city ahead of anticipated clashes between participants in the nationalist right wing march and counter demonstrators.\n\nUnited States President Donald Trump took to Twitter to condemn the attack, writing that \"We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!\".\n\nHe later expressed his \"condolences to the family of the young woman killed today, and best regards to all of those injured, in Charlottesville, Virginia. So sad!\"\n\nThe \"Unite the Right\" march was organized to protest the removal of a statue honoring Gen. Robert E. Lee, commander of the Confederate Army in the 19th-century American Civil War.\n\nVirginia State Police were also investigating another incident in which a police helicopter crashed just outside the city, leaving both the pilot and passenger dead.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the air crash was connected to the rally and counter protests, although police have said that \"there is no indication of foul play being a factor\".

photographer captured James Fields, 20, among the front lines of a volatile rally about 10:30 a.m. Saturday in Charlottesville, just two hours before the fatal crash.\n\nLike those alongside Fields, he was sporting a white polo and tan slacks, while clutching the racially-charged insignia on a wooden black and white shield.\n\nSouthern Poverty Law Center spokeswoman Rebecca Sturtevant told The News the logo -- two white axes -- is a variation of imagery used by the Vanguard America hate group.\n\nPhotos show Fields was standing with members of Vanguard America during Saturday's clash.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League depicted the hate group as one focused on white identity but noted that its members have \"increasingly demonstrated a neo-Nazi ideology.\"\n\nAs the protest images surfaces, the hate group tried distancing itself from Fields and said anyone who attended the rally could use a shield.\n\n\"The driver of the vehicle that hit counter protesters today was, in no way, a member of Vanguard America. All our members had been safely evacuated by the time of the incident,\" the group said in a tweeted statement. \"The shields seen do not denote membership, nor does the white shirt. The shields were freely handed out to anyone in attendance.\"\n\n\"All our members are safe and accounted for, with no arrests or charges,\" the group added.\n\nThe photo was taken just before he got behind the wheel of his sports car and mowed down dozens of counter protesters.\n\nFields peppered his Facebook page with similar imagery.\n\nFields, of Maumee, Ohio, went by \"Conscious Ovis Aries\" on the social network, using the Latin word for sheep in his username.

Samantha Bloom, who was watching her son's cat at the time the incident took place, only learned that her son was suspected of plowing his car into protesters when she was approached by reporters at her home in Maumee, Ohio.\n\n\"Running his car into a crowd of people?

I thought it had something to do with Trump,\" she said. \"Trump's not a supremacist.\"\n\nBloom said she doesn't talk about politics with her son.\n\nRelated: Charlottesville Faces its Own Past After Rally Turns Deadly\n\n\"I try to stay out of his political views. We don't -- I don't really get too involved,\" Bloom said. \"... like I said, I don't really talk to him about his political views. So I don't really understand what the rally was about.\"\n\nA federal civil rights investigation into the ramming has been launched, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the probe \"will have the full support of the Department of Justice.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump faced bipartisan criticism after suggesting \"both sides\" were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville.\n\nDemocrats criticized the president for failing to single out white nationalists, and several Republicans issued statements condemning white nationalism or white supremacists.\n\nAs Bloom was told about the allegations against her son, she told reporters that Fields' has a black friend.\n\nThe car-ramming attack followed a Friday night march, where hundreds of white supremacists carrying tiki torches clashed with counter-protests on the University of Virginia campus.\n\nMarchers alternated between chanting the Nazi-linked slogan \"Blood and soil!\" and You will not replace us!\" among others.", "time": "16:35:00"}

deadly, Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer expressed his displeasure with how Donald Trump carried himself during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\"Old saying: when you dance with the devil, the devil doesn't change, the devil changes you,\" Signer said on NBC's \"Meet The Press\" Sunday morning, explaining why he previously said on Saturday that he hopes President Trump \"looks himself in the mirror and thinks very deeply about who he consorted with.\"\n\n\"I think they made a choice in that campaign,\" Signer continued. \"A very regrettable one, to really go to people's prejudices, to go to the gutter.\"\n\nSinger believes \"these influences around the country, these anti-Semites, racists, Aryans, neo-Nazis, KKK,\" people who were \"always in the shadows,\" have \"been given a key and a reason to come into the light.\"\n\n\"The time has come for this to stop,\" the mayor said. \"This should be a turning point. This movement jumped the shark and it happened yesterday. People are dying and I do think that it's now on the president and on all of us to say 'enough is enough.'\"\n\nGatherings of white nationalists violently clashed with counter-protesters on Saturday, and one person was killed and 19 others were injured when a car plowed through a crowd of counter-demonstrators.\n\nPresident Trump is facing widespread criticism from both parties for suggesting that \"many sides\" were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville.\n\nThe car crash was \"a clear terrorist attack with a car used as a weapon,\" Signer said.\n\nSigner also released the name of the woman who killed when a driver rammed his car into a group of anti-racist protesters demonstrating against an alt-right and white nationalist rally.

James Alex Fields Jr., the man allegedly responsible for killing one woman and injuring 19 others in Charlottesville, has been charged with murder following the crash, according to a new report.\n\nPanic struck the state of Virginia on Aug. 12 after a man plowed his car into a crowd of people at a rally. The driver has now been identified as James Alex Fields Jr., who was charged with second degree murder mere hours after the tragic incident, according to the NY Post. The death count has only increased since the crash, going up from one victim to three. The Charlottesville Police Department issued a statement today that James, originally from Ohio, also faces three counts of malicious wounding, and one count related to fleeing the scene.\n\nA bond hearing for James has reportedly been set for Monday Aug. 14. At this present time, authorities do not believe that he has arranged for an attorney to fight for his case. We can't imagine that James would walk away from this without serious punishment. The three car pile-up he caused during a white nationalist rally sent pedestrians flying, and left many others bleeding on the street. \"It was absolutely the most horrible thing I've ever witnessed,\" said Brittany Caine-Conley, the lead organizer with Congregate Charlottesville, to ABC. \"We ran to the scene and one of my friends actually tried to hold the wounds together for the woman who has passed away.\"\n\nWithin minutes, social media erupted with heartfelt messages for the victims. Celebrities and politicians alike bonded together to beg this violent behavior to stop! This is NOT the answer! Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and more world leaders flocked to Twitter to share their remorse. Lady Gaga also shared moving words that tugged at our heartstrings. Our thoughts are will Charlottesville.\n\nHollywoodLifers, please keep the victims of Charlottesville in your prayers.", "time": "03:14:00"}

Charlottesville that killed one woman and injured 19.\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr, of Maumee, Ohio, was charged with second-degree murder and is currently being held at Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail.\n\nElderly man found dead in lift one month after being reported missing Several hundred protesters were marching in downtown Charlottesville on Saturday to take a stand against a white supremacist rally.\n\nDisturbing video footage shows a Dodge Challenger, which is registered to Fields, accelerating into the crowd of protesters who are hurled into the air before the car reverses at speed.\n\nA 32-year-old woman, whose identity has not been revealed, was killed in the attack.\n\nFields was caught and arrested a few streets away from the bloody carnage.\n\nThe governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, said his only message for the white supremacists and neo-Nazis that brought chaos to Charlottesville is to 'go home'.\n\nBefore the death of a 32-year-old woman was confirmed, Charlottesville mayor Michael Signer said he was disgusted to see white nationalists descend on his town, going on to blame Donald Trump for inflaming racial prejudices during his presidential campaign last year.\n\nRescue worker who pulled baby from rubble shot dead in Syria\n\nMr Signer said: 'I'm not going to make any bones about it. I place the blame for a lot of what you're seeing in America today right at the doorstep of the White House and the people around the president.'\n\nThe FBI has now opened a civil rights investigation into the deadly crash.\n\nViolence erupted at the University of Virginia ahead of planned Unite the Right rally, organised by white supremacists at Emancipation Park.\n\nShocking footage shows fighting between dozens of protesters, paint being thrown on them and some of the protesters being pepper-sprayed in the face.\n\nPolice could be heard shouting: 'We'll not intervene until given command to do so.'\n\nMembers of the clergy at the local church could be seen linking arms in a bid to block one of the entrances to the park, while alt-right protesters chanted 'White lives matter' as they marched through.\n\nPictures from the protests showed white supremacists holding torches in the air and chanting slogans such as 'one people, one nation, end immigration' as they clashed with anti-fascism protesters.\n\nShould Donald Trump be banned from Twitter?\n\nTraci Blackmon, a black woman who was inside the church in Charlottesville, Virginia, described the fear of those people inside.\n\nWriting on Twitter, she said: 'They are coming for the church! Police all around. They won't let us go outside. Y'all these KKK are marching with torches!'", "time": "08:51:00"}

And now, one day later, the anti-hate movement across the U.S. is stepping up to gather again, this time in solidarity.\n\nStarting on Saturday night and continuing through Sunday, organized vigils will give distant observers an opportunity to come together and pay tribute to the heroes of Charlottesville. The intent, according to The Indivisible Project, is to \"[stand in] solidarity with our brave friends in Charlottesville who put themselves at risk to fight against hatred and white supremacy.\"\n\nNote the links at the end of that Facebook post. You can use the second one to find a gathering near you; all you need to do is type in your ZIP code.\n\nIf you'd like to honor Ms. Heyer's sacrifice more directly, there's also a GoFundMe campaign running right now. Her family is connected to it and, after it's over, the funds will be released to whomever is charged with managing her estate.\n\nThere's plenty more work to be done -- hateful ideologies won't disappear anytime soon. But watching an event like Charlottesville unfold in real time can be numbing, especially for those of us who couldn't participate and/or don't have a strong support network at home. The simple act of standing alongside other people who feel just as frustrated, confused, scared, and angry as you do is its own form of healing.\n\nIt's important to never flinch in the face of this kind of violence, but Ms. Heyer and the others who gathered in Charlottesville bore the brunt of this latest outburst. Day-after vigils like these give the rest of us an opportunity to thank them in a publicly meaningful way.", "time": "17:35:00"}

neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klan members - planning to stage what they described as their largest rally in decades to \"take America back\" - clashed with counterprotesters in the streets and a car ploughed into crowds, leaving one person dead and 19 others injured.\n\nHours later, two state police officers died when their helicopter crashed at the outskirts of town. Officials identified them as Berke M.M. Bates of Quinton, Virginia, who was the pilot, and H. Jay Cullen of Midlothian, Virginia, who was a passenger. State police said their Bell 407 helicopter was assisting with the unrest in Charlottesville. Bates died one day before his 41st birthday; Cullen was 48.\n\nGovernor Terry McAuliffe (D), who had declared a state of emergency, said that he had a message for \"all the white supremacists and the Nazis who came into Charlottesville today: Go home. You are not wanted in this great commonwealth\".\n\nIn an emergency meeting, the Charlottesville City Council voted unanimously to give police the power to enact a curfew or otherwise restrict assembly as necessary to protect public safety.\n\nVideo recorded at the scene of the car crash shows a 2010 grey Dodge Challenger accelerating into crowds on a pedestrian area, sending bodies flying - and then reversing at high speed, hitting yet more people. Witnesses said the street was filled with people opposed to the white nationalists who had come to town bearing Confederate flags and anti-Semitic epithets. A 32-year-old woman was killed, police said.\n\nThe driver of the Challenger, James Alex Fields, 20, of Ohio, was arrested and charged with one count of murder, three counts of malicious wounding, and one count of hit-and-run attended failure to stop with injury. He is being held without bail and is scheduled to be arraigned tomorrow. Police made three other arrests in connection with violence earlier in the day, on charges of assault and battery, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon.\n\nField's mother, Samantha Bloom, told AP that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn't know it was a white supremacist rally. \"I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist,\" Bloom said.\n\n\"He had an African-American friend so ... ,\" she said before her voice trailed off. She added that she'd be surprised if her son's views were that far right.\n\nBloom, who became visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally, said she and her son had just moved to the Toledo area from the northern Kentucky city of Florence.\n\nFields's father was killed by a drunk driver a few months before the boy's birth, according to an uncle. His father left him money that the uncle kept in a trust until Fields reached adulthood. \"When he turned 18, he demanded his money, and that was the last I had any contact with him.\"\n\nThe uncle, who saw Fields mostly at family gatherings, described his nephew as \"not really friendly, more subdued\". Angela Taylor, a spokeswoman for the University of Virginia Medical Centre, said 19 others were brought to the hospital in the early afternoon after the car barrelled through the pedestrian centre. Five were in critical condition. Another 14 people were hurt in street brawls.\n\nEarlier, police evacuated a downtown park as rallygoers and counterprotesters traded blows and hurled bottles and chemical irritants at one another, putting an end to the rally before it officially began. Dozens of the white nationalists in Charlottesville were wearing red Make America Great Again hats. Despite the decision to quash the rally, clashes continued on side streets and throughout downtown.\n\nChan Williams, 22, was among the counterprotesters at the pedestrian centre, chanting \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Whose streets? Our streets!\" The marchers blocked traffic, but Williams said drivers weren't annoyed. Instead, she said, they waved or honked in support. So when she heard a car engine rev up and saw the people in front of her dodging a moving car, she didn't know what to think.\n\n\"I saw the car hit bodies, legs in the air.

Mr. Fields is charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at the scene of an accident that resulted in a death. He in custody at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail.\n\nHe had told her about the rally last week, but didn't offer details about its nature, Ms. Bloom said.\n\n\"I thought it had something to do with [President] Trump,\" she said.\n\n\"I try to stay out of his political views,\" she said. \"I don't get too involved.\"\n\nMr. Fields had moved out of her home \"five or six months ago\" to his own Maumee apartment, Ms. Bloom said. She declined to give the address. Ms. Bloom said they moved to northwest Ohio from Florence, Ky., about a year ago for her job.\n\nAlong the quiet street where his mother lives, neighbors living in the colorful one-story, conjoined units said they didnt know much about the 20-year-old.\n\nLaurie Schoonmaker, who lives across the street from Ms. Bloom, said she had not seen his car in months, but when he was there he often blasted polka music from the car.\n\nOn May 25 he was charged by the Maumee Police Department with having expired or unlawful license plates on the same car connected to Saturday's attack. He was found guilty of the traffic offense in June.\n\nBob Rose, 62, who lives two doors down from Ms. Bloom, said he never spoke to the man.\n\n\"It's shocking to know it's that close to you,\" he said.\n\nMr. Rose said he had seen a vehicle matching the silver Dodges description at the house and might have waved, but not much more.\n\n\"I've never spoken with the gentleman, I don't know anything about him,\" he said. \"You just never know. Until you get the whole story, you can assume what you want. Was he there to cause mayhem? Was he a white supremacist? I don't know.\"\n\nIf he does hold extremist views, Mr. Rose said, \"I don't want to know him.\"\n\nMr. Rose expressed concern the neighborhood would be swarmed with media and the curious public. Even as he spoke to reporters Saturday evening, cars slowed when they drove past.\n\n\"This is what Im afraid of, sightseers,\" he said.\n\nMaumee Mayor Richard Carr said after he heard the news, he contacted a Maumee police lieutenant, who mentioned the mans earlier traffic violation in the city. The last Maumee authorities knew of him, the man still lived in Monclova Township, the mayor said.\n\n\"It's not attention obviously we want. It's very sad,\" he said. \"He's not been found guilty yet, but just the association that comes with the name of the city across the nation or the world, if those are the actions, it certainly doesn't reflect the people of the area.\"\n\nOhio officials also denounced the violence. Gov. John Kasich tweeted that \"There is no place in America for this violence and vicious hatred coming from white nationalist, KKK & neo-nazi groups.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) wrote: \"The tragedy in Charlottesville this afternoon was domestic terrorism. We must all condemn hatred and white nationalism,\" and Democratic Sen.

\"must not be tolerated.\"\n\n\"The shameful events in Charlottesville are unacceptable and must not be tolerated,\" Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson said in a statement Saturday. The Navy will \"forever stand against intolerance and hatred,\" he added.\n\nSuch a bold statement from Richardson on public violence is a rarity.\n\nRichardson's comments come after a day of violent clashes between white nationalists at the Unite the Right rally and antifa in Charlottesville. Before the rally had officially started, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe declared a state of emergency at approximately 11:40 a.m. This allowed police to break up any and all assemblies, regardless of permit.\n\nMost of the violence was relatively low-level in intensity and restricted to street skirmishes. However, during the afternoon, a man driving a Dodge Challenger barreled through a group of antifa, killing one person and injuries 19 others. Police immediately arrested the driver and later identified him as 20-year-old James Alex Fields, Jr., an Ohio man. Searches into Fields' background revealed a social media profile replete with alt-right imagery. Fields is being charged with one count of second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and a count of hit-and-run.\n\nThe FBI and Department of Justice have subsequently opened investigations into the incident.\n\nOther government figures have also issued loud condemnations of the events that took place in Charlottesville.\n\n\"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides,\" President Donald Trump said from his private golf club in New Jersey. \"It has been going on for a long time in our country -- not Donald Trump, not Barack Obama. It has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America.\"\n\n\"The views fueling the spectacle in Charlottesville are repugnant,\" Ryan tweeted. \"Let it only serve to unite Americans against this kind of vile bigotry.\"\n\nGOP Sen. John McCain said \"white supremacists\" cannot be American patriots.\n\n\"White Supremacists and neo-Nazis are, by definition, opposed to American patriotism and the ideals that define us as a people and make our nation special,\" McCain said in a statement.", "time": "14:13:00"}

The vehicle with Ohio plates is believed to belong to James Fields of Maumee.\n\nJames Alex Fields, Jr., texted his mother Friday to say he had dropped his cat off at her Monclova Township home so he could go to an \"alt-right\" rally in Virginia.\n\nIt shocked Samantha Bloom that the 20-year-old Maumee man is now accused of plowing into a crowd of people peacefully protesting a white nationalist rally Saturday in a Virginia college town -- killing one person, hurting at least two dozen more and ratcheting up tension in a violent confrontation.\n\nShe had returned from dinner Saturday evening unaware that her son was involved and had not yet been contacted by authorities.\n\n\"I told him to be careful,\" she said of her son's participation at the rally. \"[And] if they're going to rally to make sure he's doing it peacefully.\"\n\nIt didn't appear that happened, she said tearfully. Mr. Fields is charged with second-degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at the scene of an accident that resulted in a death. He in custody at the Albemarle-Charlottesville Regional Jail.\n\nRELATED: 3 dead in Virginia protests | Trump says 'no place' for violence\n\nHe had told her about the rally last week, but didn't offer details about its nature, Ms. Bloom said.\n\n\"I thought it had something to do with [President] Trump,\" she said.\n\n\"I try to stay out of his political views,\" she said. \"I don't get too involved.\"\n\nMr. Fields had moved out of her home \"five or six months ago\" to his own Maumee apartment, Ms. Bloom said. She declined to give the address. Ms. Bloom said they moved to northwest Ohio from Florence, Ky., about a year ago for her job.\n\nAlong the quiet street where his mother lives, neighbors living in the colorful one-story, conjoined units said they didn't know much about the 20-year-old.\n\nLaurie Schoonmaker, who lives across the street from Ms. Bloom, said she hadn't seen his car in months, but when he was there he often blasted polka music from the car.\n\nOn May 25 he was charged by the Maumee Police Department with having expired or unlawful license plates on the same car connected to Saturday's attack. He was found guilty of the traffic offense in June.\n\nBob Rose, 62, who lives two doors down from Ms. Bloom, said he never spoke to the man.\n\n\"It's shocking to know it's that close to you,\" he said.\n\nMr. Rose said he had seen a vehicle matching the silver Dodge's description at the house and \"might have waved,\" but not much more.\n\n\"I've never spoken with the gentleman, I don't know anything about him,\" he said. \"You just never know. Until you get the whole story, you can assume what you want. Was he there to cause mayhem? Was he a white supremacist? I don't know.\"\n\nIf he does hold extremist views, Mr. Rose said, \"I don't want to know him.\"\n\nMr. Rose expressed concern the neighborhood would be swarmed with media and the curious public. Even as he spoke to reporters Saturday evening, cars slowed when they drove past.\n\n\"This is what I'm afraid of, sightseers,\" he said.\n\nMaumee Mayor Richard Carr said after he heard the news, he contacted a Maumee police lieutenant, who mentioned the man's earlier traffic violation in the city. The last Maumee authorities knew of him, the man still lived in Monclova Township, the mayor said.\n\n\"It's not attention obviously we want. It's very sad,\" he said. \"He's not been found guilty yet, but just the association that comes with the name of the city across the nation or the world, if those are the actions, it certainly doesn't reflect the people of the area.\"\n\nOhio officials also denounced the violence. Gov. John Kasich tweeted that \"There is no place in America for this violence and vicious hatred coming from white nationalist, KKK & neo-nazi groups.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) wrote: \"The tragedy in Charlottesville this afternoon was domestic terrorism. We must all condemn hatred and white nationalism,\" and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown tweeted, \"I stand with my Republican colleague.\"\n\nBlade staff writer Mark Zaborney and The Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\nContact Lauren Lindstrom at llindstrom@theblade.com, 419-724-6154 or on Twitter @lelindstrom.\n\nRelated Items Lauren Lindstrom, Samantha Bloom, Charlottesville, alt-right, virginia, monclova township, maumee, Richard Carr, Mark Zaborney", "time": "04:55:00"}

It meets the definition of terrorism,\" McMaster said in an interview on ABC News' \"This Week.\"\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr., 20, was arrested Saturday and charged with second-degree murder in the attack. Video footage appears to show him driving his 2010 Dodge Challenger into a group of counter-protesters who were in Charlottesville to demonstrate against white nationalists and neo-Nazis who were rallying against the removal of a Robert E. Lee statue.\n\nFields was photographed earlier in the day with a group of white nationalists.

As people swarmed his car, he sped off in reverse.\n\nHeather Heyer, 32, was killed in what authorities say was an intentional attack. Nineteen others were reportedly injured.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Justice Department and FBI will investigate the attack.\n\nMcMaster's description of the attack as terrorism comes as President Trump is being accused of not issuing a strong enough condemnation of the attack or the white nationalist protesters.\n\n\"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence, on many sides. On many sides,\" Trump said in a statement Saturday.\n\nTrump critics said that his statement implied that counter-protesters were as violent on Saturday as the white nationalists and neo-Nazis.\n\nMcMaster was asked about Trump's statement in an interview on Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\n\"When he condemned bigotry and hatred on all sides, that includes white supremacists and neo-Nazis, and I...know it's clear in his mind, it ought to be clear to all Americans, we cannot tolerate, obviously, that bigotry, that hatred that is rooted in ignorance,\" McMaster said.", "time": "15:14:00"}

deliberately driving into her during protests over a far right rally was photographed earlier in the day standing with the white supremacist, neo-Nazi group Vanguard America.\n\nJames Fields, 20, of Maumee, Ohio, allegedly killed Heather Heyer, aged 32, and injured 19 others when he rammed his car into a group peacefully protesting against a far right rally on Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nPhotographs from earlier that day appear to show Fields rallying with Vanguard America and carrying a shield bearing the group's insignia. He also wears the white polo shirt and khaki pants which are the group's uniform.\n\nVanguard America were a highly visible presence at the Unite the Right rally on Saturday, where they marched in military-style formation, and the torchlight rally the previous night on the University of Virginia campus. On the group's Twitter account, and on social media accounts belonging to regional chapters, there was extensive promotion of the Unite the Right rally in the weeks leading up to the event.\n\nThe group's motto, \"blood and soil\" was a popular chant at both events. It is derived from the Nazi slogan \"blut und boden\", which links conceptions of racial purity with a particular national territory.\n\nCol Martin Kumer, the superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville regional jail, told the Guardian that Fields had been charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death.\n\nWitnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it. The incident with the car left 19 people injured, five critically.\n\nFields was one of four people who have been arrested over the violence on Saturday which also included fighting and skirmishing between far right protesters and counter-protesters.\n\nVirginia police have not yet provided a motive for the attack with the vehicle but US attorneys and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have opened a civil rights investigation into the crash, an FBI field office said.\n\nAmerican Fascism\n\nVanguard America's manifesto, American Fascism, details their desires for a white ethnostate, the restoration of strictly patriarchal families, and limiting the influence of \"international Jews\".\n\nOf Vanguard America, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) says the group \"is particularly focused on recruiting young men and has engaged in unprecedented outreach efforts to attract students on American college campuses\". Its leader, military veteran Dillon Irizarry, has said \"the future is the youth\".\n\nDuring the 2016-2017 school year, chapters were active in posting flyers on college campuses in 10 states, from Arkansas to Oregon. On the group's website, printable flyers bear slogans including \"Beware the International Jew\", \"Imagine a Muslim-Free America\", and \"Fascism: The Next Step for America\".\n\nAccording to the ADL, the group claims 200 members in 20 states, and has paramilitary tendencies. Members have open-carried firearms at events in open carry states.\n\nLeader Izirarry claims the group started in California. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the group split from \"alt right\" group American Vanguard. This group in turn arose from the neo-Nazi \"Iron March\" web forum. Other users of that forum have been involved in alleged violence: in May, Devon Arthurs, who had been active on the forum, was arrested for the murder of two roommates, who were also members of the forum.\n\nOn Twitter on Saturday night, Vanguard America denied that Fields was a member, despite his presence with the group, and his uniform dress, saying that \"shields were freely handed out to anyone in attendance\".\n\nIn a previous tweet commenting on the rally, they wrote: \"Our members carry a purpose within them that drives them to risk their life and wellbeing for the cause. Bystanders won't understand.\"\n\nFederal authorities are also looking into a helicopter crash on Saturday that killed two Virginia state police officers aiding efforts to quell the clashes.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "time": "15:06:00"}

There was no question that she would protest throngs of neo-Nazis and other extremists that had descended on her town.\n\n\"She always had a very strong sense of right and wrong, she always, even as a child, was very caught up in what she believed to be fair,\" Bro said. \"Somehow I almost feel that this is what she was born to be, is a focal point for change. I'm proud that what she was doing was peaceful, she wasn't there fighting with people.\"\n\nShe recalled that her daughter was charitable and reached out to the underprivileged. Bro said Heather used to invite friends who were \"having a hard time\" to stay with them, sometimes for months. Anyone who needed help received it from Heather, Bro said.\n\nOthers who knew Heyer expressed similar sentiments. A neighbor in Charlottesville told HuffPost that, \"she lived her life like her path -- and it was for justice.\" A GoFundMe page set up Heyer's name by a family friend said that Heyer was killed \"while protesting against hate.\"\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) sent a message of support to Heyer's family and said that, \"her bravery should inspire us all to come together.\"\n\nA neighbor of #charlottesville victim Heather Heyer tells me this morning, \"She lived her life like her path -- and it was one of justice.\" pic.twitter.com/3jzHuK9pVo -- Andy Campbell (@AndyBCampbell)\n\nAugust 13, 2017\n\nJames Fields Jr., 20, was arrested and charged with 2nd degree murder over the crash.

Charlottesville, Va., Saturday said she urged her son that if he was going to the rally to \"be careful.\"\n\nJames Alex Fields Jr., 20, of Maumee, Ohio, texted his mother Friday to say he had dropped his cat off at her house so he could go to an \"alt-right\" rally in Virginia.\n\n\"I told him to be careful,\" Samantha Bloom, a paraplegic, told the Toledo Blade. \"[And] if they're going to rally to make sure he's doing it peacefully.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Saturday night, Bloom said she didn't know it was a white supremacist rally.\n\n\"I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump's not a white supremacist,\" said Bloom, who became visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally.\n\n\"He had an African-American friend so ...,\" she said before her voice trailed off. She added that she'd be surprised if her son's views were that far right.\n\nThe Blade reported Sunday that FBI agents had interviewed Bloom about her son.\n\n\"They contacted me to let me know they were in the area, that they were going to talk to the mother, which they already have,\" Lucas County Sheriff John Tharp told the paper, referring to the FBI. \"What the conversation was, I don't know.\"\n\nBloom returned from dinner Saturday unaware of her son's arrest, the paper reported.\n\nHe told her about the rally last week, she told the paper.\n\n\"I don't talk to him about political views,\" she said. \"So I don't understand what the rally was about.\"\n\nBloom told the paper her son moved out of her home \"five or six months ago.\" He had an apartment, she said.\n\nThey moved to northwest Ohio from Florence, Ky., about a year ago for her job, the Blade reported.\n\nFields brandished a shield with a white supremacist emblem just hours before the deadly rampage Saturday, the New York Daily News reported.\n\nThe paper reported photographing Fields on the front lines of the rally about 10:30 a.m. flanked by other white men in polo shirts and tan slacks clutching the racially charged black-and-white insignia of the Vanguard America hate group.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League depicted Vanguard America as a white identity group whose members have \"increasingly demonstrated a neo-Nazi ideology,\" the paper reported.\n\nMilitary records show that Fields entered the Army on Aug. 18, 2015, around the time his mother wrote on Facebook that he had left for boot camp, The New York Times reported. Less than four months later, on Dec. 11, his period of active duty concluded. It was not immediately clear why he left the military.\n\nThe paper also quoted Caitlin Robinson, who attended Ockerman Middle School in Florence, Ky., with Fields, as saying that his interest in far-right ideologies dated back years.\n\n\"On many occasions there were times he would scream obscenities, whether it be about Hitler or racial slurs,\" Robinson told the paper in an email Sunday.\n\nHer email also said Fields \"mostly kept to himself\" and \"didn't start fights or try to fight,\" the paper reported. She also described him as \"exceptionally odd and an outcast to be sure.\"\n\n\"He wasn't afraid to make you feel unsafe,\" she said, according to The Times.\n\nFields' father was killed by a drunken driver a few months before his birth, an uncle told The Washington Post. His father left him money that the uncle kept in a trust until Fields reached adulthood.\n\n\"When he turned 18, he demanded his money, and that was the last I had any contact with him,\" the uncle told the paper.\n\nFields has been charged with murder in the second degree, three counts of malicious wounding, and with leaving the scene.

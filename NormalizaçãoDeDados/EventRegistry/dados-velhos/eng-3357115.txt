These guys are here to do that and they have done quite some work in Harare. They are now here in Gwanda in a rural setup and this should be something very important,\" Hlongwane said.\n\nGarcia told reporters that he hoped the visit by the Barcelona legends would help promote the image of the country globally.\n\n\"The idea is to do some projects in the country and to support the youth and to support the country internationally. My job is to bring all the legends of Barcelona here, the likes of Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Juliano Belleti, Kluivert, Davids, Gaizka Mendietta, Carles Puyol... and to play a team of legends from Zimbabwe,\" Garcia said.\n\n\"I think that is going to give hope to the youth while promoting talent in the country and bringing a piece of Europe to Zimbabwe.

He played in Italy for AC Milan and later enjoyed a successful spell with Juventus before being loaned out to Barcelona in 2004.\n\nHe went on to play for Inter Milan and Tottenham Hotspur before returning to Ajax.\n\nKluivert spent six years at Barcelona from 1998 where he formed a successful partnership with Brazilian Rivaldo and won the Spanish La Liga championship in 1999.\n\nGarcia, who has a rich network of former and current international footballers, has a foundation that has academy projects in countries such as China, Panama, Tanzania and Uganda. He was also in Zambia last year, where he discussed prospects of establishing similar projects in that country.\n\nIn 2015 Garcia took Barcelona legends to Uganda where they played an exhibition match in which the former lost 5-3.\n\nApart from Kluivert and Davids, former Manchester United striker Andy Cole, John Barnes and another Barcelona legend, Luis Figo have visited Zimbabwe in the past.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3357115", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T12:37:00Z", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "source": {"uri": "bulawayo24.com", "title": "Bulawayo24 News", "id": "1585"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "12:37:00", "url": "http://bulawayo24.com/index-id-news-sc-national-byo-115893.html", "storyUri": "eng-3357115", "id": "8915104", "image": "http://img.bulawayo24.com/articles/ex-barca-legends-768x575.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "12:37:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

They are now here in Gwanda in a rural setup and this should be something very important,\" Hlongwane said.\n\nGarcia told reporters that he hoped the visit by the Barcelona legends would help promote the image of the country globally.\n\n\"The idea is to do some projects in the country and to support the youth and to support the country internationally.

He was also in Zambia last year, where he discussed prospects of establishing similar projects in that country.\n\nIn 2015 Garcia took Barcelona legends to Uganda where they played an exhibition match in which the former lost 5-3.\n\nApart from Kluivert and Davids, former Manchester United striker Andy Cole, John Barnes and another Barcelona legend, Luis Figo have visited Zimbabwe in the past.", "extractedDates": null, "isDuplicate": false, "eventUri": "eng-3357115", "details": {}, "dateTime": "2017-08-13T06:06:00Z", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "source": {"uri": "thestandard.co.zw", "title": "The Standard", "id": "1492"}, "originalArticle": null, "timeCrawl": "06:06:00", "url": "https://www.thestandard.co.zw/2017/08/13/barca-legends-attend-zanu-pf-rally/", "storyUri": "eng-3357115", "id": "8877888", "image": "https://www.thestandard.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/European-legends.jpg", "date": "2017-08-13", "time": "06:06:00", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-13"}

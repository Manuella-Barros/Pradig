Answer by Dr. Abbie Maro\u00f1o, PhD in Psychology & Human Behaviour Analysis, Lancaster University, on Quora: Many people mistakenly equate antisocial behavior with shyness, introversion, or a preference for solitude. They might think that someone who is \"antisocial\" simply prefers to be alone or avoids social interactions. In reality, antisocial behavior, in the psychological sense, refers to actions that harm or lack consideration for the well-being of others. It includes behaviors such as aggression, deceit, theft, and a lack of remorse. It is a key characteristic of Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD)\u200b (MDPI)\u200b. Addressing why some people are truly antisocial is a complex task, as it involves a combination of biological, psychological, and environmental factors. Let\u2019s dive into some of the contributing factors. At the biological level, genetic factors play a significant role in predisposition to antisocial behavior. Twin and adoption studies have demonstrated higher concordance rates for antisocial traits in identical twins compared to fraternal twins, indicating a genetic component. Further, neurological abnormalities, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala, are strongly linked to antisocial behavior. The prefrontal cortex, essential for decision-making and impulse control, often shows reduced activity in antisocial individuals, leading to impulsivity and poor judgment. The amygdala, which processes emotions such as fear and aggression, may also exhibit irregularities, contributing to these behaviors.

These deficits hinder their ability to understand and respond appropriately to the emotions of others, fostering behaviors that are socially harmful or indifferent. This pattern of behavior typically begins in childhood or early adolescence and persists into adulthood. Environmental influences, particularly adverse childhood experiences, are strongly associated with the development of antisocial behavior. Neglect, abuse, and exposure to violence during childhood can disrupt normal social and emotional development, leading to maladaptive behaviors as coping mechanisms. Dysfunctional family environments, characterized by inconsistent discipline, lack of parental supervision, and parental antisocial behavior, significantly contribute to the development of antisocial traits as children often model these behaviors. Additionally, association with delinquent peers and exposure to environments that reinforce antisocial behavior can exacerbate these tendencies, particularly during adolescence, a critical period for social and behavioral development. In my expert opinion, and that of many of my fellow academics, the most informative models are ones that highlight the interaction between each of these factors. For example, the biopsychosocial model suggests that genetic predispositions interact with environmental influences and individual psychological processes to shape behavior. Similarly, the diathesis-stress model proposes that individuals with a genetic predisposition for antisocial behavior may develop these traits when exposed to significant stressors or adverse environmental conditions. By integrating insights from multiple disciplines, we can better address the underlying causes of antisocial behavior and promote healthier social functioning.

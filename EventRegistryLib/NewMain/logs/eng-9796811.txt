The incident, which occurred on August 6, has led to a public apology from the artist and disciplinary action. According to several reports, as per the Yongsan Police Station in central Seoul, a police officer discovered Suga fell from an electric scooter near Hannam-dong on Tuesday evening. Recognizing the BTS member and detecting the strong smell of alcohol, the officer took Suga to the nearby police station. A subsequent breathalyzer test revealed that Suga's blood alcohol concentration exceeded the legal limit of 0.08 percent, resulting in the immediate revocation of his driver's license. Drunk driving on an electric scooter is a violation of the Road Traffic Act in South Korea.\n\nBTS' SUGA apologises after drunk driving incident on electric scooter; BigHit Music says, \"As a social service worker, he will receive appropriate disciplinary action\"\n\nIn an apology shared on social media on August 7, Suga expressed deep regret for his actions. He stated, \"It is with a very heavy and apologetic heart that I have to come to you with such disappointment. After drinking at dinner last night, I rode home on an electric kickboard. I violated road traffic laws without realizing that I was not allowed to use an electric kickboard while drunk due to the simple thought that it was a short distance away.\"\n\nThe BTS rapper further explained the incident, saying, \"While setting up my electric scooter at the front door of my house, I fell alone. A police officer was nearby, and as a result of a breathalyzer test, my license was revoked, and I was fined. Although no one was harmed or any facilities were damaged during this process, I bow my head in apology to everyone as it is my responsibility and there is no room for excuses.\"\n\nSuga concluded his apology by acknowledging the impact of his actions and vowing to be more responsible in the future. He stated, \"I apologise to everyone who was hurt by my careless and wrong actions, and I will be more careful in my actions to avoid such incidents in the future.\"\n\nBigHit Music, the agency representing BTS, also released a statement expressing their apology and outlining the disciplinary measures to be taken against Suga. The agency stated, \"Hello. This is BigHit Music. We apologise for the accident involving BTS member Suga's electric scooter.\"\n\nThe statement detailed the incident, stating, \"On Tuesday night (June 6), Suga used an electric scooter while wearing a helmet while returning home after drinking alcohol. After traveling about 500 meters, he fell while parking and was given a ticket and license revocation as a result of a sobriety test by police officers who were nearby. The incident did not result in any personal injury or property damage, and he returned home under police escort.\"\n\nBigHit Music emphasized their disappointment with Suga's behaviour and assured fans that appropriate disciplinary action would be taken against him. The agency stated, \"We apologise for the disappointment this artist's inappropriate behaviour caused many of you. As a social service worker, he will receive appropriate disciplinary action from his employer for his behaviour. We will be more careful to prevent this from happening in the future. Thank you.\"\n\nSuga's mandatory military service as a social service agent, which typically involves a regular daily work schedule, allows him to return home after work hours. His enlistment is set to end in June of next year.\n\nALSO READ: From BTS' Jimin to Stray Kids to G(I)DLE - Here's a round-up of Korean music release in July 2024Tags : BTS, Drunk Driving,

The officer conducted a breathalyser test on him, and his licence was revoked and he was fined.\n\nSince 2021, users of electric scooter in South Korea are required to have a driver's licence.\n\nSuga added: \"Although no one was harmed and no facilities were damaged during this incident, I bow my head in apology to everyone as it is my responsibility (to uphold the law) and there is no room for excuses.\n\n\"I apologise to everyone who was hurt by my careless and wrong actions, and I will be more careful in my actions to avoid such incidents in the future.\"\n\nBigHit Music similarly confirmed the incident. The label, which manages BTS, said: \"While returning home drunk, Suga wore a helmet and used an electric scooter. After moving about 500m, he fell while parking.\"\n\nIt added: \"We apologise for disappointing many people due to our artiste's inappropriate behaviour. We will accept any disciplinary action from his workplace as a social service worker for this misconduct.\"\n\nAside from Suga, five other members of the superstar septet - RM, J-Hope, Jungkook, Jimin and V - are currently serving their mandatory military service. The group's oldest member Jin, 31, who was the first to enlist among them, was discharged from the army in June.", "source": {"uri": "tnp.straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Paper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suga_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suga (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motorcycles_and_scooters", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric motorcycles and scooters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Traffic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yonhap News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BTS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongsan_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yongsan District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yongsan District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_band", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boy band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K-pop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathalyzer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breathalyzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_South_Korea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conscription in South Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (motorcycle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jimin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Seok-jin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Seok-jin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungkook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jungkook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RM_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RM (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BTS (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helmet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://tnp.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/rl680/public/IMGSUGAAgustDTOUR11UJ2RQRF.jpg?itok=qJgRp-Em", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796811", "eventUri": "eng-9796811", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 167, "textEnd": 172, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 531, "textEnd": 536, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

In South Korea, electric kickboards - commonly referred to as electric scooters - are subject to stringent safety regulations similar to those for automobiles, and their use requires a valid license.\n\nAccording to police accounts, Suga was found alone on the night of August 6, 2024, after he reportedly rode the electric scooter while intoxicated. Officers on patrol detected the smell of alcohol and subsequently escorted him to the nearby police station for further investigation. Updates from the police revealed that Suga's breathalyzer test results showed a blood alcohol concentration exceeding the legal limit of 0.08%, which could have serious implications for his driving license.\n\nOn August 7, 2024, BigHit Music addressed the incident with an official statement posted on BTS's community board. The statement, as reported by koreaboo, read, \"Hello, this is BigHit Music. We apologize for the matter of BTS' member Suga driving home on an electric scooter while drunk. On the night of August 6, Suga used a helmet while driving an electric scooter home after drinking. He had driven around 500 meters before he parked and fell down. Through a police officer who had been nearby, a breathalyzer test was conducted, and as per the results, Suga's license was revoked, and he was fined. No casualties occurred through the incident; neither was any property damaged. He was escorted home by the police\".\n\nThe statement continued, \"We apologize for disappointing many people through our artist's unsavory actions. As a public service officer, he conducted himself in a manner that caused strife in society, and thus, he plans on duly receiving the appropriate punishment from his workplace. We will be even more cautious to prevent similar matters from occurring in the future. Thank you\".\n\nIn addition to the company's statement, Suga personally apologized through Weverse. He wrote, \"Hello, this is Suga. I'm feeling extremely heavy-hearted and sorry to have to come to you all over such a disappointing matter. I rode an electric scooter home last night, after having drinks with dinner. I thought that it was a close distance, and I did not realize that you could not operate an electric scooter after drinking. As such, I violated traffic rules. I parked in front of the main gates to my home, and I fell over by myself in that process. A police officer was nearby, and through the results of a breathalyzer test, my license was revoked and I paid a fine. Although no one was hurt, neither was any property harmed in the matter, as this is inexcusably something I have to take responsibility for, I bow my head in apology to everyone. I apologize to those who were hurt by my irresponsible and wrong actions, and I will be even more careful with my actions to prevent such matters from occurring in the future\".\n\nThe incident highlights the seriousness with which South Korean laws treat electric scooter usage, governed by similar traffic laws as cars. According to SE Daily, electric scooters have a fatality rate of 5.6% for traffic accidents, which is 4.3 times higher than the overall traffic accident fatality rate.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

A police officer was nearby, and as a result of a breathalyzer test, my license was revoked, and I was fined.

The incident did not result in any personal injury or property damage, and he returned home under police escort,\" it continued.\n\n\"We apologize for the disappointment this artist's inappropriate behaviour caused many of you.

as a social service agent for his compulsory military stint, faced an undisclosed penalty and license cancellation following charges for breaching Seoul's road laws.\n\nIn an online statement, Suga expressed remorse, saying: \"I am very heavy-hearted and apologetic to bring you disappointing news.\"\n\nHe recounted how a post-dinner tipple led him to ride an electric scooter home, admitting his lapse in judgement due to the short distance and unawareness that riding while intoxicated was illegal.\n\n\"After drinking at a dinner yesterday night, I rode an electric scooter home,\" he said. \"I violated the Road Traffic Act due to my complacent thinking that it was a short distance and my failure to recognise that using an electric scooter while intoxicated was prohibited.\n\n\"I fell while parking the scooter in front of my house, and the nearby police officer conducted a breathalyser test, resulting in the cancellation of my license and a fine.\"\n\nSign up to OK!'s daily newsletter to

apologize to everyone.\"\n\nHis heartfelt regret also extended to those affected by his actions: \"I apologise to everyone hurt by my careless and wrong actions, and I will be more careful in my actions in the future to prevent such incidents from occurring again.\"\n\nBig Hit, the record label behind the 'Butter' chart-toppers, extended its apologies on behalf of Suga, whose legal name is Min Yoon-gi, acknowledging the \"inappropriate behaviour\" of their artist.\n\nIts formal statement said: \"We express our sincere apology for the incident involving BTS member Suga and his electric kickboard accident.\"\n\nIt continued with an apology for any let down, stating: \"We apologise for the disappointment caused by the artist's inappropriate behaviour.\"\n\nAcknowledging the consequences, the record label added: \"As a social service agent during his military service, he is prepared to accept any disciplinary actions from his place of work for causing a social disturbance.\n\n\"We will take greater care to ensure that such incidents do not happen again in the future.\"", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The incident occurred in Seoul, where the rapper was fined as a result of his actions.\n\nIn a heartfelt message posted on social media, the 31-year-old artist expressed his deep regret for disappointing his followers. He stated that he felt \"very heavy-hearted and apologetic\" for the recent events.\n\nIn his statement, Suga explained that he had \"violated the road traffic act\" while riding home, mistakenly believing the distance was short. He admitted to forgetting that operating an electric scooter while intoxicated is against the law.\n\nSuga recounted that he fell while attempting to park the scooter in front of his home, which attracted the attention of a nearby police officer. After being subjected to a breathalyser test, his license was revoked, and he faced a fine. South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that his blood alcohol level was measured at 0.08%.\n\nDespite no injuries or property damage resulting from the incident, Suga emphasized that he accepts full responsibility for his actions. \"This is entirely my responsibility with no excuses,\" he stated. He also extended his apologies to \"those who have been hurt by my carelessness and wrongful behaviour\" and committed to ensuring such an incident does not happen again.\n\nAt present, BTS is on hiatus as individual members attend to their mandatory military service commitments. Suga began his service last year and is currently serving as a social service agent, having been deemed unfit for standard combat duty due to a shoulder surgery in 2020.\n\nBTS's label, Bighit, has also responded to the incident with an apology. In their statement, they expressed regret over Suga's actions and the disappointment it has caused. They affirmed their commitment to preventing such occurrences in the future and mentioned that Suga is prepared to face any disciplinary measures from his employer for causing a social disturbance.", "source": {"uri": "theglobalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Global Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suga_(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suga (rapper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motorcycles_and_scooters", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric motorcycles and scooters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BTS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-pop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "K-pop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yonhap News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathalyzer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breathalyzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood alcohol content"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (motorcycle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_South_Korea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conscription in South Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 68}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796811", "eventUri": "eng-9796811", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Suga took to Weverse on Wednesday morning and penned down a long apology note stating that he was drunk when he was returning home on his electric scooter.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn his note, he stated that he violated traffic laws, and after the police officer caught him and did a breathalyzer test, his license was revoked and he was fined. Suga, in his note, shared, \"Hello. This is Suga. It is with a very heavy and apologetic heart that I have to come to you with such disappointment. After drinking at dinner last night, I rode home on an electric kickboard. I violated road traffic laws without realizing that I was not allowed to use an electric kickboard while drunk due to the simple thought that it was a short distance away.\"\n\nWhile talking about his license being revoked, Suga wrote, \"While setting up my electric scooter at the front door of my house, I fell alone. A police officer was nearby, and as a result of a breathalyzer test, my license was revoked, and I was fined. Although no one was harmed or any facilities were damaged during this process, I bow my head in apology to everyone as it is my responsibility and there is no room for excuses.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Suga apologized for his carelessness and wrong actions and said, \"I apologize to everyone who was hurt by my careless and wrong actions, and I will be more careful in my actions to avoid such incidents in the future.\"\n\nBigHit Music's Comment on the Incident\n\nBTS agency BigHit Music also issued a statement. It read, \"Hello. This is BigHit Music. We apologize for the accident involving BTS member Suga's electric scooter.\"\n\nThey further wrote, \"On Tuesday night (June 6), Suga used an electric scooter while wearing a helmet while returning home after drinking alcohol. After traveling about 500 meters, he fell while parking and was given a ticket and license revocation as a result of a sobriety test by police officers who were nearby. The incident did not result in any personal injury or property damage, and he returned home under police escort.\"\n\nIn conclusion, the music company said that Suga will face disciplinary action for his wrongdoing and said, \"We apologize for the disappointment this artist's inappropriate behavior caused many of you. As a social service worker, he will receive appropriate disciplinary action from his employer for his behavior. We will be more careful to prevent this from happening in the future.

His apology came within hours of reports of his electronic kickboard scooter incident surfaced on the Internet. The BTS member's prompt response to his drunk driving mistake has earned fans' sympathy.\n\nEarlier, on August 7, Korean media reports stated that Suga's driving license was revoked after he fell from his electronic scooter and was caught by police. The nearby policeman asked the BTS member to take a breath analyzer test. After checking the results of the breath analyzer test, the rapper's driving license was revoked.\n\nBTS rapper Suga's drunk electric kickboard incident: What happened?\n\nHours after BTS Suga's drunk-driving reports emerged, the \"Daechwita\" singer took to the fan community platform Weverse to address the issue and tell fans what happened. The Korean rapper wrote (originally in Korean), \"Hello, this is Suga. I come with a heavy and sorry heart to you guys due to a disappointing event.\"\n\n\"Last night, after drinking at dinner, I went home by riding an electric scooter. I violated the road traffic laws due to thinking easily that it was a close distance and not recognizing that it is not allowed to ride an electric scooter after drinking. While parking my electric scooter at the front gate in front of my place, I fell by myself, and there was a police officer nearby. As a result of drinking, my license has been revoked, and I've been fined,\" he continued.\n\nSuga's Weverse post also mentioned that nobody got hurt or his drunk driving incident damaged no property. He added, \"This is an inexcusable responsibility of mine, so I bow my head and apologize to everyone. I apologize to those who have gotten hurt because of my carelessness and wrong action, and from now on and forward, I will be more and more careful with my actions so nothing like this will happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, BTS Suga is currently undergoing Korean mandatory military training as a public service worker. His military training will conclude in June 2025.

Suga, whose real name is Min Yoongi, was taken to a nearby police station and is now being investigated for violating the Road Traffic Act (drunk driving).\n\nSuga's military enlistment\n\nBigHit Music and HYBE have yet to respond to the report. Suga enlisted for military training on September 22, 2023. At that time, he posted an emotional farewell to his fans on Weverse, saying, \"I'll faithfully serve and come back ... Please stay healthy and let's meet all again in 2025!\"\n\nHe entered the Nonsan Training Center in South Chungcheong Province for basic training before transitioning to his role as a social service worker, likely due to his previous shoulder surgery. Social service agents are expected to serve for 21 months.\n\nSince his enlistment, Suga has maintained a low profile.

Suga, who is currently serving as a social service agent, was discovered intoxicated while operating the scooter, an act that led to immediate intervention by local authorities.\n\nThe incident unfolded when Suga, returning from a dinner while under the influence of alcohol, fell off the scooter in front of his residence. A nearby police officer, responding to the situation, detected the smell of alcohol on Suga's breath and administered a breathalyzer test, which confirmed that Suga's blood alcohol content exceeded the legal limit. As a result, he was fined and had his driver's license revoked.\n\nThe situation prompted concern about whether SUGA's actions might lead to an extension of his military service as a form of punishment. However, on August 7, the Military Manpower Association issued a clarification regarding the matter. An official from the Association stated that no additional disciplinary measures would be applied to SUGA, such as an extension of his service period. The rationale behind this decision is that social service agents are held accountable for their actions only when they occur during official working hours. Since SUGA's drunk driving incident happened during off-hours, the Association determined that \"no special punishment\" would be necessary.\n\nIn response to the incident, SUGA issued a heartfelt apology on Weverse, expressing regret over the situation. He stated, \"Hello, this is Suga. I'm feeling extremely heavy-hearted and sorry to have to come to you all over such a disappointing matter. I rode an electric scooter home last night, after having drinks with dinner. I thought that it was a close distance, and I did not realize that you could not operate an electric scooter after drinking. As such, I violated traffic rules. I parked in front of the main gates to my home, and I fell over by myself in that process. A police officer was nearby, and through the results of a breathalyzer test, my license was revoked and I paid a fine. Although no one was hurt, neither was any property harmed in the matter, as this is inexcusably something I have to take responsibility for, I bow my head in apology to everyone. I apologize to those who were hurt by my irresponsible and wrong actions, and I will be even more careful with my actions to prevent such matters from occurring in the future\".\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

What is closed on Juneteenth 2024?", "body": "Biden just signed legislation to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. Here's why this once local celebration is significant to U.S. history.\n\nOn June 19, 1865, Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, with 2,000 Union troops with a message for the more than 250,000 enslaved Black people there.\n\nThey were finally free.\n\nJuneteenth, also known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, Emancipation Day or the Second Independence Day, celebrates African-American freedom in the United States. Wednesday marks the fourth year that Juneteenth has been a federal holiday.\n\nIt's also the fourth year that Florida has declined to make it a state holiday.\n\nWhat is Juneteenth?\n\nLincoln's Emancipation Proclamation freed enslaved people in the United States as of Jan. 1, 1863.\n\nBut it was left up to slaveowners to tell their enslaved people about their new freedom, and many of them simply ignored it since at the time it couldn't be enforced in secessionist states under Confederate control, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. It took nearly 2\u00bd years with many people still enslaved until Granger assured the newly freed residents of Galveston that Union troops would enforce it.\n\n\"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free,\" Granger announced. \"This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property, between former masters and slaves and the connection heretofore existing between them, becomes that between employer and hired labor. The Freedmen are advised to remain at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts; and they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.\"\n\nThe first Juneteenth celebration to mark the date was held in Galveston the very next year, in 1866, and it spread as African Americans migrated away from the South. But many white people mocked it.\n\nAfter Reconstruction ended, Juneteenth and Florida's own Emancipation Day celebrations were smaller, subdued affairs amid renewed calls for racial segregation and the rise of racial violence, lynchings and Jim Crow laws in the state and across the South. It wasn't until the civil rights protests of the 1960s and 70s many decades later when Juneteenth and Emancipation Day were finally celebrated in a big way as an act of defiance and pride, according to James Schnur's history of the holidays in TheGabber.com.\n\nGov. Lawton Chiles signed the Juneteenth Observance Bill into law in May 1991, calling on \"public officials, schools, private organizations, and all citizens to honor the historic significance\" of June 19.\n\nJuneteenth celebrations: What is open and closed on Juneteenth in Florida? Holiday is on a Wednesday this year\n\nDoes Florida observe Juneteenth?\n\nEvery U.S. state has recognized Juneteenth as a holiday or observance, and \"at least 28 states and the District of Columbia have designated Juneteenth as a permanent paid and/or legal holiday\" at least once, according to the Congressional Research Service. Texas was the first state to officially observe it, in 1980, but Florida was the second in 1991, well before the rest of the country.\n\nHowever, Florida, along with states like California, Hawaii, Pennsylvania and more than two dozen others does not officially recognize the holiday and doesn't include the date on official state calendars as a paid holiday.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis issued a resolution in 2020 calling upon Floridians to honor Juneteenth. \"Juneteenth is an important opportunity to honor the principles of the Declaration of Independence and celebrate the achievements and contributions African Americans have made, and continue to make, in Florida and across our Nation,\" the resolution read.\n\nHe has not issued any other Juneteenth resolutions since and repeated attempts to make Juneteenth an official state holiday have failed in the Florida Legislature. The last was in 2022.\n\nSome county commissions and city councils have declared Juneteenth a recognized holiday and closed offices. In April Lakeland officials voted unanimously to make Juneteenth a paid holiday for city workers, starting this year.\n\nWhat is Emancipation Day in Florida?\n\nInstead, like many other states Florida celebrates the day slavery ended inside its borders.\n\nUnion Gen. Edward M. McCook announced the Emancipation Proclamation in Tallahassee on May 20, 1865, a little more than a month after Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. May 20 is honored in Florida as Emancipation Day (although it isn't a paid holiday, either).\n\nAs with Juneteenth, the date gained more prominence and significance during the civil rights marches and protests in the later twentieth century.\n\n\"Celebrating the 20th of May as Emancipation Day is a long-held tradition in Tallahassee and other parts of Florida,\" Secretary of State Cord Byrd said in a release. \"Especially during the Capital City's bicentennial year, this annual commemoration allows us to come together as a community in the spirit of celebration, history, and freedom.\"\n\nMark your calendars: A complete list of Florida's state holidays for 2024\n\nIs Juneteenth a paid holiday in Florida? Do we work on Juneteenth?\n\nJuneteenth is a federal holiday, not an official state one. For federal workers it's a paid holiday and nonessential federal workers will have the day off, although some businesses offer it as a paid day for their employees.\n\nOnly about half of the states in the U.S. recognize Juneteenth as an official holiday, although more are considering it.\n\nWhy is it called Juneteenth?\n\n\"Juneteenth\" is a portmanteau, combining the words \"June\" and \"nineteenth,\" the day Granger issued the proclamation.\n\nJuneteenth is for everyone: These Americans want you to know Juneteenth is a national holiday for everyone, not just Black people\n\nWhat is closed on Juneteenth 2024? Is the post office open on Juneteenth?\n\nThe Federal Bank Reserve observes Juneteenth and will be closed that day, so most banks also will be closed. All U.S post offices will be closed and mail will not be delivered. All non-essential federal offices will be closed. Some local governments may opt to close Wednesday.\n\nSome businesses, such as Starbucks, give their employees the option of a day off but most businesses will remain open.", "source": {"uri":

It is an annual celebration that marks the end of slavery in the United States after the Civil War. Observed every year on June 19, Juneteenth holds significant cultural and historical importance, highlighting the lasting impact of Black communities. The name 'Juneteenth' is a blend of June and nineteenth, the date when the news of liberation finally reached enslaved individuals in Galveston. The holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, to bring about the freedom of all enslaved people, over two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed. Why Is Red-Coloured Food Eaten on Juneteenth? Best Dishes To Enjoy on US Federal Holiday.\n\nJuneteenth became a federal holiday on June 17, 2021. This year, Juneteenth, 2024, will be celebrated on Wednesday, June 19. Let's explore some facts and interesting information about this important day as we prepare to celebrate.\n\n1. After the Emancipation Proclamation was issued on January 1, 1863, not all people trapped in slavery were immediately freed.\n\n2. The name Juneteenth combines 'June' and 'nineteenth.' It is also known as Freedom Day, Juneteenth Independence Day, Emancipation Day, Jubilee Day, Cel-Liberation Day and Second Independence Day.\n\n3. Juneteenth National Independence Day is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983, making it the 11th federal holiday recognised by the US government.\n\n4. Former Texas state representative Al Edwards, known as the 'father of Juneteenth,' sponsored the bill that made Juneteenth a state holiday in 1980.\n\n5. Juneteenth became a federal holiday in June 2021. The African American community has celebrated Juneteenth since 1866.\n\n6. Juneteenth has its own flag. The red, white, and blue colours signify that the enslaved people and their descendants are American. The bursting star in the middle represents Texas and newfound freedom.\n\n7. The celebration of Juneteenth extends beyond the United States. In El Nacimiento, Coahuila, Mexico, the Mascogos population, descendants of Africans from Texas and the Seminoles, celebrates Juneteenth every year.

In 2021, it became a federal holiday for the first time.\n\nCities across the U.S. have marches and festivals in recognition of the holiday, which falls on June 19 - a Wednesday this year.\n\nHere's a brief primer on Juneteenth.\n\nIn short, Juneteenth - a combination of the words \"June\" and \"19th\" - is the primary holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. Its date is tied to a speech informing the formerly enslaved black people of Texas that the Civil War was over and they were, therefore, free.\n\nThe holiday traces back to a speech given by a Union general in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865. In his \"General Order No. 3,\" Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger declared that, with Texas under Union control, \"all slaves are free\" in the state, owing to the Emancipation Proclamation issued by President Abraham Lincoln more than two years earlier.\n\nThe order did not end slavery overnight in Texas, just as Lincoln's earlier proclamation had not ended its practice in other Confederate states. But the formerly enslaved people of Texas, particularly in the area around Galveston, began to celebrate Juneteenth as the day of slavery's abolition a few years later.\n\nThe holiday, alternatively known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, Emancipation Day, Cel-Liberation Day and Black Independence Day, is often marked by parades and public ceremonies, though celebrations vary widely from place to place.\n\nBut the Juneteenth holiday doesn't just celebrate one day in history, says Minkah Makalani, an associate professor and director of the Center for Africana Studies studies at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe holiday \"has always meant something more than just celebrating that 'We're free and equal to you.' It's always been bound up with, 'We're free and now we want freedom to mean something beyond what you think it means,'\" Makalani says.\n\n\"It's a celebration of Blackness and Black life displayed in all its complexity and dynamism and diversity.\"\n\nIn the decades since the first celebration, Juneteenth has been adopted across the U.S., particularly in the South.\n\nIn 2023, gatherings were held all over the U.S., from New York City to Los Angeles, as well as in the home of Juneteenth, Galveston, Texas. In 2024, similar celebrations are being held across the country, including at the White House, where President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris presided over a concert in an early Juneteenth celebration that featured performances from Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle.\n\nThe celebrations are particularly jubilant in Texas, Makalani says.\n\n\"In Texas, it definitely has a tremendous source of pride and meaning and significance for people in this state who continue to suffer various forms of white supremacy and racial injustice,\" Makalani says.\n\n\"It's not too different in intent and passion from what you see in Carnival celebrations - not the scale and grandeur of those but the sense of celebration.\"\n\nJuneteenth became a federal holiday when Biden signed a bill on June 17, 2021, establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day. It brought the total number of federal holidays to 11, and marked the first new federal holiday since the creation of Martin Luther King Holiday in 1983.\n\nIn a signing ceremony at the White House in 2021, Biden said that Juneteenth National Independence Day was a day to remember the \"moral stain\" on U.S. history that was slavery, but emphasized that establishing the holiday was not the end of America's obligations.\n\n\"It's ... not enough just to commemorate Juneteenth. After all, the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans didn't mark the end of America's work to deliver on the promise of equality; it only marked the beginning,\" Biden said.\n\n\"To honor the true meaning of Juneteenth, we have to continue toward that promise because we've not gotten there yet.\"\n\nBecause it is a federal holiday, many federal government offices are closed for Juneteenth, including the U.S. Postal Service, meaning the mail is not delivered on the day Juneteenth is observed.\n\nWhile Juneteenth is now a federal holiday, not every state legally recognizes it as an official public holiday on which state employees get the day off.\n\nIn 1980, Texas, where the holiday originated, was the first state to designate Juneteenth a permanent state holiday. For four decades, it was the only state to do so, until 2020, when lawmakers began to take up the Juneteenth cause in the wake of the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. That year, Virginia, South Dakota and New York designated Juneteenth as a permanent state holiday, and many other states have since followed suit.\n\nIn June 2023, 28 states and Washington, D.C., were set to legally recognize Juneteenth as a public holiday, according to the Pew Research Center, with state workers getting the day off. In three states - California, Pennsylvania and North Carolina - the paid day off only applied to some public employees or could be taken as a floating holiday.\n\nIn at least two states - Alabama and West Virginia - governors have designated Juneteenth a holiday for state employees in recent years, including in 2024, though their respective state legislators have yet to pass legislation enshrining it as a permanent state holiday.\n\nAnd though not every state has designated Juneteenth an official holiday, every state has recognized it as a \"day of observance,\" with some stopping short of giving state employees the day off work.", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

What is closed on Juneteenth 2024?", "body": "On June 19, 1865, Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, with 2,000 Union troops with a message for the more than 250,000 enslaved Black people there.\n\nThey were finally free.\n\nJuneteenth, also known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, Emancipation Day or the Second Independence Day, celebrates African-American freedom in the United States. Wednesday marks the fourth year that Juneteenth has been a federal holiday.\n\nIt's also the fourth year that Florida has declined to make it a state holiday.\n\nLincoln's Emancipation Proclamation freed enslaved people in the United States as of Jan. 1, 1863.\n\nBut it was left up to slaveowners to tell their enslaved people about their new freedom, and many of them simply ignored it since at the time it couldn't be enforced in secessionist states under Confederate control, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture. It took nearly 2\u00bd years with many people still enslaved until Granger assured the newly freed residents of Galveston that Union troops would enforce it.\n\n\"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free,\" Granger announced. \"This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property, between former masters and slaves and the connection heretofore existing between them, becomes that between employer and hired labor. The Freedmen are advised to remain at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts; and they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.\"\n\nThe first Juneteenth celebration to mark the date was held in Galveston the very next year, in 1866, and it spread as African Americans migrated away from the South. But many white people mocked it.\n\nAfter Reconstruction ended, Juneteenth and Florida's own Emancipation Day celebrations were smaller, subdued affairs amid renewed calls for racial segregation and the rise of racial violence, lynchings and Jim Crow laws in the state and across the South. It wasn't until the civil rights protests of the 1960s and 70s many decades later when Juneteenth and Emancipation Day were finally celebrated in a big way as an act of defiance and pride, according to James Schnur's history of the holidays in TheGabber.com.\n\nGov. Lawton Chiles signed the Juneteenth Observance Bill into law in May 1991, calling on \"public officials, schools, private organizations, and all citizens to honor the historic significance\" of June 19.\n\nJuneteenth celebrations: What is open and closed on Juneteenth in Florida? Holiday is on a Wednesday this year\n\nEvery U.S. state has recognized Juneteenth as a holiday or observance, and \"at least 28 states and the District of Columbia have designated Juneteenth as a permanent paid and/or legal holiday\" at least once, according to the Congressional Research Service. Texas was the first state to officially observe it, in 1980, but Florida was the second in 1991, well before the rest of the country.\n\nHowever, Florida, along with states like California, Hawaii, Pennsylvania and more than two dozen others does not officially recognize the holiday and doesn't include the date on official state calendars as a paid holiday.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis issued a resolution in 2020 calling upon Floridians to honor Juneteenth. \"Juneteenth is an important opportunity to honor the principles of the Declaration of Independence and celebrate the achievements and contributions African Americans have made, and continue to make, in Florida and across our Nation,\" the resolution read.\n\nHe has not issued any other Juneteenth resolutions since and repeated attempts to make Juneteenth an official state holiday have failed in the Florida Legislature. The last was in 2022.\n\nSome county commissions and city councils have declared Juneteenth a recognized holiday and closed offices. In April Lakeland officials voted unanimously to make Juneteenth a paid holiday for city workers, starting this year.\n\nInstead, like many other states Florida celebrates the day slavery ended inside its borders.\n\nUnion Gen. Edward M. McCook announced the Emancipation Proclamation in Tallahassee on May 20, 1865, a little more than a month after Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House in Virginia. May 20 is honored in Florida as Emancipation Day (although it isn't a paid holiday, either).\n\nAs with Juneteenth, the date gained more prominence and significance during the civil rights marches and protests in the later twentieth century.\n\n\"Celebrating the 20th of May as Emancipation Day is a long-held tradition in Tallahassee and other parts of Florida,\" Secretary of State Cord Byrd said in a release. \"Especially during the Capital City's bicentennial year, this annual commemoration allows us to come together as a community in the spirit of celebration, history, and freedom.\"\n\nMark your calendars: A complete list of Florida's state holidays for 2024\n\nJuneteenth is a federal holiday, not an official state one. For federal workers it's a paid holiday and nonessential federal workers will have the day off, although some businesses offer it as a paid day for their employees.\n\nOnly about half of the states in the U.S. recognize Juneteenth as an official holiday, although more are considering it.\n\n\"Juneteenth\" is a portmanteau, combining the words \"June\" and \"nineteenth,\" the day Granger issued the proclamation.\n\nJuneteenth is for everyone: These Americans want you to know Juneteenth is a national holiday for everyone, not just Black people\n\nJuneteenth is observed every year on June 19th.\n\nThe Federal Bank Reserve observes Juneteenth and will be closed that day, so most banks also will be closed. All U.S post offices will be closed and mail will not be delivered. All non-essential federal offices will be closed. Some local governments may opt to close Wednesday.\n\nSome businesses, such as Starbucks, give their employees the option of a day off but most businesses will remain open.\n\nContributors: Brandon

Here's everything you need to know about the holiday, including what day it takes place, what will be closed and why we celebrate.\n\nWhen is Juneteenth 2024?\n\nJuneteenth always falls on June 19. In 2024, the holiday is on a Wednesday.\n\nAre banks open on Juneteenth?\n\nLike most federal holidays, expect your local banks and credit unions to be closed in observance of Juneteenth. Plan ahead if you think you will need anything from your bank on June 19.\n\nAre government offices open on Juneteenth?\n\nNo. All non-essential federal, state and city government offices are closed Wednesday, June 19, for the holiday.\n\nGovernment closures would include high-traffic spots including the Monroe County Department of Motor Vehicles. and the Monroe County Clerk's Office.\n\nWill you get mail on Juneteenth?\n\nYour regular mail will not be delivered on June 19 because the United States Postal Service also recognizes the Juneteenth holiday.\n\nYes, public schools will be closed for the federal holiday, even with the holiday landing during the last week of school in the Rochester region.\n\nRegarding private schools and universities, check the academic calendar to see if it is closed.\n\nWill stores, restaurants close for Juneteenth?\n\nEven though it is a federally recognized holiday, individual businesses decide whether or not they would like to be open on Juneteenth. You may want to call any local stores or restaurants you're planning on going to and ask if they'll be open.\n\nWhy do we celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday marking slaves in Texas learning in 1865 that they had been freed by President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. The executive order outlawed slavery in Confederate states beginning Jan. 1, 1863, the midpoint of the Civil War. The holiday rose to prominence in 2020 amid the nationwide protests about racial inequality after the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minnesota. President Joe Biden made Juneteenth a federal holiday in 2021.\n\nHow many federal holidays remain in 2024?\n\nEach year, there are 11 federal holidays. Juneteenth is fifth in the annual lineup.\n\nAfter Juneteenth, six federal holidays remain in 2024:", "source": {"uri": "democratandchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democrat and

But celebrations and observances for the holiday are far from new.\n\nJuneteenth marks the day in 1865 enslaved people in Galveston, Texas found out they had been freed -- after the end of the Civil War, and two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nSince it was designated a federal holiday in 2021, Juneteenth has become more universally recognized beyond Black America. Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nAnd while several services and businesses are closed on the holiday, many others are open -- including museums, some of which are offering free admission.\n\nHere's a look at the history of Juneteenth, what it means, how to celebrate and what's open and closed.\n\nJuneteenth marks the day in 1865 enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, found out they had been freed -- after the end of the Civil War, and two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nJuneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and large gatherings.\n\nIn the first years after the end of the Civil War, outdoor spaces allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed legislation to make Juneteenth a federal holiday in 2021. That same year, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed Illinois' law to make Juneteenth a state holiday.\n\n\"I'm pleased to see the federal government join Illinois in recognizing Juneteenth as an official holiday, offering all Americans a day to reflect on the national shame of slavery and the work we must do to dismantle systemic racism,\" Pritzker said in a statement. \"Most importantly, let us stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Black Americans who will celebrate Juneteenth as a milestone in their fight for every ounce of the freedom that is their God-given right - and continue with them in that fight.\"\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start.\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" said Freeman, the comedian.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other? You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way,\" Freeman said.\n\nNo matter what race you are, you will \"absolutely\" elicit a smile if you utter either greeting, he said.\n\n\"I believe that a non-Black person who celebrates Juneteenth ... it's their one time to have a voice, to participate.\"\n\nIn addition, flags will fly at half-staff across Illinois from sunrise on June 19 to sunset on June 20.\n\nMail Service\n\nJuneteenth is included in holidays observed by the United States Postal Service, meaning that no mail delivery will occur and all post offices will be closed.\n\nBanks\n\nBanks that observe federal holidays, including Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo and others, will be closed for the day on June 19.\n\nState, Federal Buildings\n\nAll state and federal facilities, including Department of Motor Vehicles offices and courthouses, will be closed for the holiday.\n\nTrash Service\n\nMost communities observe federal holidays for trash pickup, including the city of Chicago. According to the city's website, there will be no residential trash pickup on June 19, but there will be recycling service available in select areas.\n\nChicago Public Schools locations and offices will be closed in observance of the holiday. No summer programming will be held on that date, according to officials.\n\nPublic schools that have summer classes will also be closed on the holiday, though private schools may choose to be open.

Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth a solemn day of remembrance or more of a party?\n\nIt just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nWhat if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are going on around the country?\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAre there special foods served on Juneteenth?\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren't Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody.

In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way.\"\n\n___\n\nTang, who reported from Phoenix, is a member of The Associated Press' Race and Ethnicity team.

Before Juneteenth was used as the official title of the holiday, it was often referred to as Emancipation Day, Jubilee Day, Freedom Day and Black Independence Day.\n\nBlack Americans began to celebrate Juneteenth to mark the anniversary of June 19, 1865, the day when Texas - the last rebel state - officially abolished slavery.\n\nWhy is it called Juneteenth?\n\nJuneteenth combines the words June, (the month when it takes place) and the number 19, (the exact date).\n\nBefore the name Juneteenth was used to title the day, other names used were Emancipation Day, Jubilee Day, Freedom Day and Black Independence Day.\n\nIs Juneteenth a U.S. federal holiday?\n\nYes. Juneteenth obtained federal holiday status during President Joe Biden's first year in office. In June 2021, an overwhelming majority in the House of Representatives, with a vote tally of 415 to 14, passed legislation designating Juneteenth as a national holiday. Following the House's decision, President Biden enacted the legislation the subsequent day.\n\nWhen did Juneteenth become a U.S. federal holiday?\n\nJuneteenth became a federal holiday in June 2021, during President Joe Biden's first year in office.\n\nThe date became a point of contention in 2020 when the Trump administration announced it would hold a major campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19. This announcement sparked outrage from Trump's critics about the date and location.\n\nIn 1921, Tulsa was the site of a massacre of Black residents and the destruction of Black-owned businesses. Soon after, Trump moved the date of his rally to June 20 \"out of respect\".\n\nWhy do people eat red food on Juneteenth?\n\nAccording to Oldways Cultural Food Traditions, the color represents the resilience of African Americans throughout their journey to freedom.\n\nRed foods like red velvet cake, hibiscus tea and strawberry soda are common culinary items eaten on Juneteenth. Additionally, red fruits like strawberries and watermelon are eaten during the holiday because they are in peak season during Juneteenth.\n\nIs there a Juneteenth flag?\n\nYes. Created by Ben Haith in 1997, the Juneteenth flag symbolizes freedom for Black Americans and African Americans. The flag's red, white and blue colors were chosen on purpose to showcase that African Americans were always American, even through enslavement, according to Parade.com.\n\nWhat does the zigzag shape around the star on the Juneteenth flag mean?\n\nAccording to Parade, the five-point star in the center of the Juneteenth flag is a callback to the U.S. flag, representing that Black people are free in all 50 states.\n\nThe zigzag-shaped outline burst around the star represents the new horizon and a new promise for Black Americans.\n\nWednesday, June 19 has been declared a day off for post offices, resulting in the suspension of deliveries by the United States Postal Service (USPS) for the day.\n\nBanks\n\nThe Federal Reserve is observing Juneteenth on Wednesday, which means most banks will be closed.\n\nWhile banks are not mandated to shut down for federal holidays, it is common for numerous branches to do so. Check your local branch before visiting.\n\nGovernment offices\n\nAll federal offices and schools will be closed on Juneteenth. However, at the state government level, some may still be open.\n\nRetail\n\nSimilar to other significant summer celebrations, individual retail stores have the discretion to operate, adjust their opening times or remain closed on Juneteenth. It's recommended to confirm the hours of operation for your planned location before going on Wednesday.\n\nIn previous years, several large corporations, including Target, Twitter, and Nike, have granted their staff a paid day off to observe Juneteenth.\n\nMORE FOX 13 SEATTLE NEWS:\n\nSeattle bikini barista responds to customer's threats by smashing windshield\n\nDeadly overnight shooting in

Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth a solemn day of remembrance or more of a party?\n\nIt just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nWhat if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are going on around the country?\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAre there special foods served on Juneteenth?\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren't Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody.

Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth a solemn day of remembrance or more of a party?\n\nIt just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nWhat if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are going on around the country?\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAre there special foods served on Juneteenth?\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren't Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way.\"\n\n___\n\nTang, who reported from Phoenix, is a member of The Associated Press' Race and Ethnicity team.

Many Americans are celebrating Juneteenth, marking the day in 1865 when the last enslaved people in the U.S. learned they were free. For generations, Black Americans have recognized the end of one of history's darkest chapters with joy, in the form of parades, street festivals, musical performances or cookouts. (Jennifer Reynolds/The Galveston County Daily News via AP, File)\n\nFor more than one-and-a-half centuries, the Juneteenth holiday has been sacred to many Black communities.\n\nIt marks the day in 1865 enslaved people in Galveston, Texas found out they had been freed -- after the end of the Civil War, and two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nSince it was designated a federal holiday in 2021, Juneteenth has become more universally recognized beyond Black America. Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth a solemn day of remembrance or more of a party?\n\nIt just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nWhat if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are going on around the country?\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAre there special foods served on Juneteenth?\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren't Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way.\"\n\nTang, who reported from Phoenix, is a member of The Associated Press' Race and Ethnicity team.

Many Americans are celebrating Juneteenth, marking the day in 1865 when the last enslaved people in the U.S. learned they were free. For generations, Black Americans have recognized the end of one of history's darkest chapters with joy, in the form of parades, street festivals, musical performances or cookouts.\n\nFor more than one-and-a-half centuries, the Juneteenth holiday has been sacred to many Black communities.\n\nIt marks the day in 1865 enslaved people in Galveston, Texas found out they had been freed -- after the end of the Civil War, and two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nSince it was designated a federal holiday in 2021, Juneteenth has become more universally recognized beyond Black America. Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth a solemn day of remembrance or more of a party?\n\nIt just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nWhat if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are going on around the country?\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAre there special foods served on Juneteenth?\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren't Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way.\"\n\nTang, who reported from Phoenix, is a member of The Associated Press' Race and Ethnicity team.

The story behind the holiday's title", "body": "June 19 marks the third consecutive year of Juneteenth as a federally recognized United States holiday. Also known as Freedom Day, Emancipation Day or America's second Independence Day, Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. after the Civil War.\n\nMany Americans have celebrated it annually for more than a century, even though the holiday was not officially added to the national calendar until 2021. As the Black Lives Matter movement gained renewed power across the country and abroad the previous year with the police killings of Black Americans like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, public calls grew louder for the federal government to acknowledge emancipation as the critical turning point it was in U.S. history. Advocates sought, again, for leaders to codify the Juneteenth holiday into law, decades after communities began to push for broader recognition of Juneteenth as an emblem of unity, power and resilience in the wake of the police beating of Rodney King in 1991.\n\nFederal recognition came in 2021. A bill to solidify Juneteenth National Independence Day as a legal public holiday passed almost unanimously through both chambers of Congress before being signed by President Biden on June 18. At a White House ceremony held for the occasion, Mr. Biden said: \"All Americans can feel the power of this day, and learn from our history.\" It was the first time a national holiday was established in the U.S. since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was set to honor the late civil rights leader's birthday in 1983.\n\nJuneteenth became a legal federal holiday in the U.S. on the eve of its earliest nationwide observance on June 19, 2021. It is observed and celebrated each year on that same date.\n\nThe origins of Juneteenth\n\nThe name, Juneteenth, is a portmanteau, combining June and nineteenth. Its origins date back to June 19, 1865, when the last group of people enslaved in the southern U.S. were informed of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation more than two years earlier, on Jan. 1, 1863, declaring that everyone held as a slave was, and would continue to be, free.\n\nThe proclamation took effect as the country neared its second year of the Civil War and technically applied to enslaved people in Confederate states. However, it could not actually be implemented in Confederate territory, and the war would not end in victory for the Union Army until much later, in the spring of 1865. In Texas, the westernmost state controlled by the Confederacy, news of freedom and the tenets of the Emancipation Proclamation arrived that summer. On June 19, thousands of Union soldiers reached Galveston Bay, along the northeastern coast of Texas in the Gulf of Mexico, and announced that all enslaved people in the state were freed by executive order.\n\nAt the time, more than 250,000 Black people were being held as slaves in Texas alone, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which writes in a description of the holiday that the \"historical legacy of Juneteenth shows the value of never giving up hope in uncertain times.\" Once the Emancipation Proclamation laid its roots in Texas, those freed from slavery declared the day of its arrival \"Juneteenth\" in homage to the date when it finally happened.\n\nAlthough the Emancipation Proclamation set the stage, critically, for an end to slavery throughout the U.S., it was the 13th Amendment to the Constitution that actually did it. The amendment's passage through Congress and across Lincoln's desk began in January 1865. It was ratified in December of that year, abolishing slavery nationwide.\n\nHow to celebrate Juneteenth\n\nObserving Juneteenth each year on June 19 does memorialize that specific day in Galveston in 1865, but it is also symbolic. Many regard the holiday as a joyful anniversary of independence and an opportunity to remember the country's foundation on centuries of slavery.\n\nHistorically, communities in different parts of the U.S. have celebrated Emancipation Day on different dates, a tradition that nodded to the fact that news of the Emancipation Proclamation reached people enslaved by the Confederacy at different times after the Civil War. In Florida, for example, advocates in 2021 pushed for the state to recognize and observe Emancipation Day on May 20, because that was the date in 1865 when news of Lincoln's executive decree reached enslaved people there. Washington, D.C., has in the past observed a city-wide Emancipation Day on April 16.\n\nJuneteenth celebrations vary. Public festivities often include parades, parties, concerts, educational workshops and other cultural events centered on art and cuisine. For some, commemorating Juneteenth is mainly about tapping into the spirit of the holiday. Koritha Mitchell, an English professor at Ohio State University who celebrated Juneteenth growing up in a small town outside of Houston, told CBS News in 2021 that, for her, the day revolved around family and \"creating community and connection.\"\n\nOpal Lee, the retired teacher and counselor whose activism played a huge role in Juneteenth becoming a federally recognized holiday, recalled joyful memories of the annual celebrations in the Texas town where she lived as a child.\n\n\"When I was a little one and we lived in Marshall, Texas, we'd go to the fairground,\" she said in a CBS News interview in 2022. \"There'd be games and food and food and food. I'm here to tell ya it was like Christmas!\"\n\nLee, now 97, became known as the \"Grandmother of Juneteenth\" for her famous trek from Fort Worth, Texas, to Washington, D.C., to ultimately deliver 1.5 million signatures to Congress advocating for a law to make the date a federal holiday. She shared her thoughts on the essence of Juneteenth in that 2022 interview.\n\n\"People think it's a Black thing when it's not. It's not a Texas thing. It's not that,\" Lee said. \"Juneteenth means freedom, and I mean for everybody!\"\n\nMelinda French Gates reflects on personal growth, commitment to advocacy", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

Here's why", "body": "This year marks the third year that New Jersey will celebrate Juneteenth as an official state holiday. However, while Juneteenth technically combines the words June and nineteenth, the state of New Jersey will be celebrating the holiday on Friday, the 21st.\n\nHere is everything you need to know about Juneteenth in New Jersey.\n\nWhat does Juneteenth celebrate?\n\nJuneteenth celebrates the day that federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas in 1865 and shared the news that slavery had been abolished, therefore freeing the state's 250,000 enslaved people. This took place two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, according to History.com.\n\nThe following year, freed men in Texas organized the first ever \"Jubilee Day\" on June 19. The day was celebrated with barbecues, prayers, music and more. Then, according to History, as Black people migrated around the country, the tradition of celebrating Juneteenth went with them.\n\nTexas became the first state to make Juneteenth an official state holiday in 1979 with several other states following suit in the years since. It is considered by many to be America's second Independence Day and is typically celebrated on June 19.\n\nWhy is New Jersey observing Juneteenth on Friday instead of Wednesday?\n\nIn 2021, President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act into law, declaring Juneteenth a federal holiday. This means that on Wednesday, June 19, banks, post offices and credit unions will be closed, and USPS will not be delivering mail. Additionally, thousands of people all over the country will have the day off of work.\n\nIn 2020, less than one year prior to the federal declaration of the Juneteenth holiday, Murphy signed legislation designating Juneteenth as a state and public holiday. However, instead of celebrating on June 19, the state observes the holiday on the third Friday of June each year.\n\nSince the New Jersey state government made Juneteenth a state holiday before the federal government declared it a national holiday, the state will continue to observe it on the third Friday in June rather than whatever day the 19th falls on.\n\nTherefore, similar to other state holidays, state agencies such as the Motor Vehicle Commission, state courts, and other state employees will be closed or have the day off on Friday.\n\nNew Jersey state holidays\n\nJuneteenth is one of 13 total state holidays that New Jersey is scheduled to observe in 2024. The other 12 holidays include:\n\nSeveral other states recognize Juneteenth as a state holiday. According to the Pew Research Center, 28 states and the District of Columbia celebrated Juneteenth in 2023 with either all or some state government workers being granted a day off.

Even though it is in its infancy on paper, Juneteenth is considered the longest-running African American holiday in history.\n\nAs the United States prepares to celebrate its fourth official Juneteenth holiday, here is an in-depth look at what the day is all about.\n\nOrigins of Juneteenth\n\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture notes that Juneteenth marks a significant date in American history.\n\nJune 19, 1865, marks the day when the Union Army arrived in Galveston, under General Gordon Granger, and announced to the locals that all enslaved African Americans were free. While the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect on January 1, 1863, and the Civil War ended in April 1865, it took time before the end of slavery was actually enforced in resistant states like Texas.\n\nReactions to freedom ranged from utter joy to pure shock. Some former slaves awaited job offers from plantation owners, but others sought new lives elsewhere, primarily in the northern United States. Settling in new areas brought challenges, but individuals rose to those challenges.\n\nThe first of what would become an annual \"Jubilee Day\" celebration took place in Texas in the year following Granger's arrival. Through the years, the day took on the name \"Juneteenth\" (a shortening of June nineteenth) and featured celebrations with prayer services, barbecues, music, and other social activities.\n\nTexas was the first state to make Juneteenth an official holiday, with others following suit in subsequent years. It wasn't until June 2021 that Congress passed a resolution establishing the celebration of Juneteenth as a national holiday. It was signed into law on June 17, 2021, a mere two days before the first official federal commemoration.\n\nJuneteenth traditions\n\nDue to federal law, federal businesses are closed for Juneteenth. Private businesses may opt to close or remain open. Some may issue a floating holiday to those who would like to observe Juneteenth.\n\nCelebrations vary across the country. Some states host parades, and families and friends may gather to play games and enjoy food and other fun. Public readings or church services relevant to the holiday also may be part of Juneteenth celebrations.\n\nJuneteenth food traditions\n\nJuneteenth has its own traditions, including some involving food. For example, many people enjoy a dish known as the Marcus Garvey salad. Marcus Garvey was a Black activist who sought to unify and connect people of African descent worldwide. The dish is made with red, green and black beans to symbolize the Pan-African flag.\n\nAdditional Juneteenth foods are red, which is no accident. Before slavery was abolished, many slaves ate foods that were white, green or brown. Eating brightly colored red foods was a rarity and a cause for excitement.\n\nThe color red also was associated with the cultures of people who used to be enslaved. Red beverages, sauce-covered barbecue, red velvet cake, and many other red foods and beverages are now served on Juneteenth.\n\nJuneteenth is now celebrated across the United States and can serve as a catalyst for discussions about American history.\n\nJuneteenth remains a celebration of not only freedom, but also family and the joy surrounding release from oppression. According to Juneteenth.com, special foods and beverages are served for Juneteenth celebrations, particularly those not available or consumed on a daily basis and many that are red in color.\n\nCelebrants recall their heritage and culture while looking ahead to future opportunities.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth a solemn day of remembrance or more of a party?\n\nIt just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nWhat if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are going on around the country?\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAre there special foods served on Juneteenth?\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren't Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type":

Gen. Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3 in Galveston, Texas, proclaiming that enslaved African Americans were free. This was more than two years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nMany African Americans have commemorated Juneteenth with parties, parades and gatherings. The Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 moved Juneteenth to the forefront of national consciousness, and at least 28 states and Washington DC -- along with the federal government -- recognize Juneteenth as a public holiday.\n\nNow, many employees both at the public and private level enjoy the day off from work. Others use it as a day of public service to volunteer in the community or advocate for issues affecting the Black American community. This year, Juneteenth falls on Wednesday, June 19. Here's what's open and closed on Juneteenth 2024.\n\nPostal services\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday for the United States Postal Service, so it will not deliver mail.\n\nHowever, all UPS and FedEx services will be open and available.\n\nFinancial services\n\nMarkets will be closed, and Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange will not be trading on Wednesday.\n\nJuneteenth is also a banking holiday observed by the Federal Reserve. Major banks like Chase and Bank of America will be closed in observance of the holiday. TD Bank, which has remained open in previous years, will also be closed Wednesday.\n\nAs always, online banking services and ATMs will be available for use.\n\nSchools and government agencies\n\nFederal offices will be closed on Juneteenth. Many schools will already be off for summer break.\n\nHowever, whether government or state employees in different places get a paid day off varies. In 2023, at least 28 states recognized Juneteenth as a public holiday for which state workers received a paid day off, according to a Pew Research analysis. Other states may hold a day of observance or other commemorations.\n\nRetailers\n\nMost major retailers and grocery stores will be open on Juneteenth. Walmart and Target, for example, will be open during normal hours. It's best to check if your local businesses and restaurants are also operating during normal hours for the holiday.\n\nCNN's Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report.\n\n6 books that explain the

Juneteenth - a combination of the words \"June\" and \"nineteenth\" - has been celebrated for decades by Black communities as Emancipation Day, but the recent broader reckoning over racial injustices and deepening political polarization has thrust the day further into national and cultural prominence.\n\nMany states and cities plan festivities to mark Juneteenth, which is often celebrated with parades, street parties and cookouts. The day is a historic one for American history, civil rights activists say, and memorializing it reaffirms the country's quest for equality.\n\nWhat is Juneteenth and its history?\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed enslaved people in Confederate states, but it did not immediately end slavery in places such as Texas that remained under Confederate control. Two and a half years later, on June 19, 1865, Union troops led by Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, and announced that more than 250,000 enslaved Black people in the state were free. (Nationwide emancipation would come only with the ratification of the 13th Amendment later that year.)\n\nFor Black people, the news was a moment of \"indescribable joy\" that was met with large celebrations in Texas, historian C.R. Gibbs told the Washington Post. Also known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, Juneteenth Independence Day and Black Independence Day, the day remains deeply significant for the community.\n\nJune 19 became a kind of July 4 celebration for African Americans, john a. powell (who does not capitalize his name), the director of the Othering and Belonging Institute at the University of California at Berkeley, told the Post.\n\n\"It's particularly important for African Americans because they are still struggling for freedom and equality. But June 19 was a momentous day to mark that next chapter that we embarked on,\" he said.\n\nRecognizing history, powell added, is part of the process. \"We can't make progress unless we have knowledge (of) where we are and where we have been,\" he said.\n\nFor Annette Gordon-Reed, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and the author of \"On Juneteenth,\" the day commemorates an advancement in human rights. \"It represents the hope that the country can strive to be better, and work to perfect the Union,\" she told the Post.\n\nHow is Juneteenth commemorated?\n\nTexas was the center of major Juneteenth festivities for decades, but the traditions have spread across the country in recent years. The initial celebrations around Juneteenth were used to teach newly freed enslaved people about voting rights.\n\nIts first anniversary, in 1866, was marked by a large procession in Galveston that was attended by hundreds of men, women and children. In Houston, community leaders pooled money to purchase land for a commemoration site, which came to be known as Emancipation Park.\n\nGordon-Reed, a Texas native, said the day is about coming together as a family and as a community to cook and eat together.\n\n\"At more public celebrations, there are speeches and poetry. It's a festive occasion, but the underlying importance of the day is emphasized,\" she added.\n\nJuneteenth celebrations are associated with a rich and distinct culinary tradition and often feature red-colored drinks and food items, including barbecue and, more recently, red velvet cake. Among the most beloved drinks is a ruby-hued elixir based on African hibiscus ginger tea, master herbalist Sunyatta Amen once wrote for the Post. Enslaved people from Africa carried a wide variety of plants and crops, including hibiscus, to the Americas, and the drink became a potent reminder of home.\n\nThis year, Galveston will screen a documentary film and host a live music event and lectures through the week on the history of Juneteenth. In D.C., the National Archives will put two historic papers, including the Emancipation Proclamation, on public display. Scotland, a historically African American community in Montgomery County, Md., that was founded by formerly enslaved people, will host a parade and a car show.\n\nWhen was Juneteenth declared a federal holiday?\n\nIn 2021, President Biden signed into law the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act - which marked June 19 as a federal holiday - during nationwide racial justice demonstrations that swept the country after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nThe measure received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, with only 14 House Republicans voting against it. Opponents of the bill called it an attempt to celebrate identity politics and to remake the country's ideology with critical race theory - which examines the way policies and laws perpetuate systemic racism - at its center.\n\nEstablishing Juneteenth as a holiday, Biden said in his remarks, would be \"one of the greatest honors\" of his presidency.\n\nAround him stood members of the Congressional Black Caucus; Vice President Harris, the first woman of color to hold the office; as well as activist Opal Lee, who had campaigned for the day to be made into a national holiday.\n\n\"We have come far, and we have far to go. But today is a day of celebration,\" Harris said at the event. \"It is not only a day of pride, it is also a day for us to reaffirm and rededicate ourselves to action.\"\n\nCivil rights groups welcomed the move. \"It is a reminder that freedom is an ongoing fight,\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson said at the time.\n\nAt least 30 states and the District of Columbia recognize Juneteenth as a public holiday.\n\nTexas was the first state to pass legislation, making it a state holiday in January 1980. Texas House Bill 1016, first introduced in early 1979, declared Emancipation Day a legal holiday. Kansas and Rhode Island are some of the latest states to mark Juneteenth as a state holiday. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear signed an executive order in May designating Juneteenth a state holiday.\n\nIn Alabama, a new bill would make Juneteenth a state holiday, although state employees would be able to choose between recognizing Juneteenth or the birthday of the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, on June 3. A similar effort is underway in Alaska, where a bill making June 19 a state holiday is awaiting the governor's nod.\n\nEvery state has at some point recognized Juneteenth at least as a day of observance - meaning it is commemorated even if it is not a day off, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nWhat's closed on Juneteenth?\n\nThe Federal Reserve and its branches will be closed Wednesday, and some major commercial banks including Bank of America and Wells Fargo will be shut. Federal courts will be closed, although the electronic filing system will be available.\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday for U.S. Postal Service employees. Pickup and delivery services will be available at UPS and FedEx locations. It is also a U.S. stock market holiday.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Gen. Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3 in Galveston, Texas, proclaiming that enslaved African Americans were free. This was more than two years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nMany African Americans have commemorated Juneteenth with parties, parades and gatherings. The Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 moved Juneteenth to the forefront of national consciousness, and at least 28 states and Washington DC -- along with the federal government -- recognize Juneteenth as a public holiday.\n\nNow, many employees both at the public and private level enjoy the day off from work. Others use it as a day of public service to volunteer in the community or advocate for issues affecting the Black American community. This year, Juneteenth falls on Wednesday, June 19. Here's what's open and closed on Juneteenth 2024.\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday for the United States Postal Service, so it will not deliver mail.\n\nHowever, all UPS and FedEx services will be open and available.\n\nMarkets will be closed, and Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange will not be trading on Wednesday.\n\nJuneteenth is also a banking holiday observed by the Federal Reserve. Major banks like Chase and Bank of America will be closed in observance of the holiday. TD Bank, which has remained open in previous years, will also be closed Wednesday.\n\nAs always, online banking services and ATMs will be available for use.\n\nFederal offices will be closed on Juneteenth. Many schools will already be off for summer break.\n\nHowever, whether government or state employees in different places get a paid day off varies. In 2023, at least 28 states recognized Juneteenth as a public holiday for which state workers received a paid day off, according to a Pew Research analysis. Other states may hold a day of observance or other commemorations.\n\nMost major retailers and grocery stores will be open on Juneteenth. Walmart and Target, for example, will be open during normal hours. It's best to check if your local businesses and restaurants are also operating during normal hours for the holiday.\n\nCNN's Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The beginner's guide to celebrating the federal holiday", "body": "Over the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\nWASHINGTON -- For more than one-and-a-half centuries, the Juneteenth holiday has been sacred to many Black communities.\n\nIt marks the day in 1865 enslaved people in Galveston, Texas found out they had been freed -- after the end of the Civil War, and two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nSince it was designated a federal holiday in 2021, Juneteenth has become more universally recognized beyond Black America. Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nRELATED: Is the post office closed on Juneteenth? Here's what's open on Wednesday.\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIt just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way.\"\n\n___\n\nTang, who reported from Phoenix, is a member of The Associated Press' Race and Ethnicity team.

Tracing The History And Significance Of June 19th", "body": "Juneteenth, now a federal holiday since 2021, marks belated end of slavery in Texas in 1865, highlighting challenges of emancipation during Civil War.\n\nJuneteenth, observed annually on June 19th, commemorates the end of slavery in US.\n\nJuneteenth is a celebration that honours the end of slavery in the United States. While President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863, it took until June 19th, 1865, for news of freedom to reach enslaved people in Texas. Union troops arrived in Galveston to enforce the proclamation, marking a significant delay in spreading the news of emancipation during the Civil War.\n\nThis delay underscores the complexities of ending slavery in America. Juneteenth not only signifies the abolition of slavery but also serves as a poignant reminder of the ongoing struggle for equality.\n\nA Celebration Rooted in History\n\nAfrican American communities have celebrated Juneteenth for generations. It was designated a federal holiday in 2021. This year, on June 19th, 2024, communities nationwide will unite to commemorate this historic day with parades, music, and reflections on the journey to freedom.\n\n\"When the Union army reached Galveston and notified Black people of their freedom, it generally signified that the last segment of the roughly four million slaves in the South now knew they were officially free,\" Nafeesa Muhammad, Associate Professor of History at Spelman College, told TIME in an email. \"And this is the significance of Juneteenth.\"\n\nFrom Texas to a National Holiday in US\n\nAccording to history.com, in 1979, Texas became the first state to make Juneteenth an official holiday; several others followed suit over the years. In June 2021, Congress passed a resolution establishing Juneteenth as a federal holiday; President Biden signed it into law on June 17, 2021.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nThe Origins of the Name \"Juneteenth\"\n\nAccording to Time magazine, Juneteenth celebrations began in Texas and other southern states as early as 1866. Many Texans pushed for the holiday to be recognised by the state-a designation that finally came in 1980. But where exactly did the term \"Juneteenth\" come from? It was a Houston paper that first shortened \"June 19th\" to \"Juneteenth\" around 1890.Click for more\n\ntrending news", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikhil_pandey@ndtv.com", "name": "Nikhil Pandey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abolitionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelman_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spelman College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US_Civil_War", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US Civil War", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Education", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/hn19s32g_juneteenth_625x300_18_June_24.jpeg?ver-20240615.100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 185, "textEnd": 194, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-06-", "textStart": 1813, "textEnd": 1820}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Per Fedex's 2024 holiday schedule, all services will carry on as normal on Juneteenth.\n\nIf school's not out for summer just yet, check their 2024 calendar to confirm if they're keeping their doors closed on Wednesday, June 19.\n\nSince it's a federal holiday, public schools are closed, but the same rules don't apply to private schools and universities.\n\nDMVs across the country will be closed on Wednesday, June 19 in honor of Juneteenth.\n\nEven though Best Buy, Target and other national chains recognize Juneteenth as an annual company holiday, most of their retail locations will be open on Juneteenth.\n\nAs always, call local stores and restaurants ahead of time to confirm their holiday hours.", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TODAY.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Postal Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_teller_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automated teller machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Best Buy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Parcel_Service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Parcel Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Retail", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x512_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-06/juneteenth-closure-post-office-2x1-bn-220617-b61e9f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 16, "textEnd": 23, "freq": 7}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The beginner's guide to celebrating the federal holiday", "body": "WASHINGTON -- For more than one-and-a-half centuries, the Juneteenth holiday has been sacred to many Black communities.\n\nIt marks the day in 1865 enslaved people in Galveston, Texas found out they had been freed -- after the end of the Civil War, and two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nSince it was designated a federal holiday in 2021, Juneteenth has become more universally recognized beyond Black America. Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nRELATED: Is the post office closed on Juneteenth? Here's what's open on Wednesday.\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIt just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way.\"\n\n___\n\nTang, who reported from Phoenix, is a member of The Associated Press' Race and Ethnicity team.

The day is also known as \"Juneteenth Independence Day,\" \"Freedom Day,\" and \"Emancipation Day.\"Juneteenth, which refers to \"June Nineteenth,\" is the day that federal forces arrived in Galveston, Texas, in 1865 to impose the abolition of slavery. After the Emancipation Proclamation was signed, this took place 2.5 years later. As the oldest African American holiday, Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery in the United States.\n\nTexas was the first state to officially recognize Juneteenth as a holiday in 1979.

Lee's surrender at\n\nAppomattox, Virginia, he arrived to inform enslaved African Americans that they were free and that the Civil War was over, as reported by the New York Times.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, over two and a half years earlier and this declaration put it into force.\n\nThere are other names for the day, including \"Juneteenth Independence Day,\" \"Freedom Day,\" and \"Emancipation Day.\"\n\nAs per the reports of Juneteenth.com, family get-togethers and prayers were part of the early Juneteenth celebrations. With time, the festivities grew to include yearly vacations to Galveston for families of former slaves.\n\nAccording to the Jesuit, the best quotes to share on the day are:\n\n\"If the cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail. Because the goal of America is freedom, abused and scorned tho' we may be, our destiny is tied up with America's destiny.\"\n\n- Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\n\"Struggle is a never ending process. Freedom is never really won, you earn it and win it in every generation.\"\n\n- Coretta Scott King\n\n\"There are still many causes worth sacrificing for, so much history yet to be made.\"\n\n- Michelle Obama\n\n\"My humanity is bound up in yours, for we can only be human together.\"\n\n- Desmond Tutu\n\n\"Knowledge makes a man unfit to be a slave.\"\n\n- Frederick Douglass\n\nQ1.

Reuters\n\nOn 19 June, the United States observes 'Juneteenth', a historic day that commemorates the end of slavery and celebrates the freedom that had reached all corners of the country.\n\nAn occasion to honour the day in 1865 when enslaved African Americans in Texas learned they were free, it is also known as Emancipation Day or Freedom Day. Many refer to it as the Second Independence Day.\n\nCities across the US plan festivities that include parades, street parties, and cookouts to mark the federal holiday. Here's how Juneteenth became a nationwide celebration.\n\nThe historical roots\n\nThe origins of Juneteenth date back to June 19, 1865, when Union General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce the end of the Civil War and the emancipation of all enslaved individuals.\n\nThis historic declaration came more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which had officially freed slaves in the Confederate states in 1863.\n\nAs per History.com, the Confederate States was a group of 11 states that seceded from the United States in 1860 following the election of President Abraham Lincoln as American.\n\nHowever, the enforcement of Lincoln's proclamation relied on the advance of Union troops, and Texas, being one of the most remote Confederate states with a low presence of Union forces, had largely avoided the executive order.\n\nAfter 2,000 troops arrived, General Granger's General Order No. 3 informed the people of Texas that all 250,000 enslaved individuals were now free, emphasising the equality of personal rights and property between former masters and slaves.\n\nFor Black people, the news marked an end of an institution that had brutalised them for centuries. The moment was \"indescribable joy\" that was met with large celebrations in Texas, historian C.R. Gibbs told The Washington Post.\n\nHow is Juneteenth celebrated?\n\nFor decades, Texas was the heart of major Juneteenth festivities, but in recent years, these traditions have spread nationwide. The early celebrations of Juneteenth were not just about rejoicing; they were also a means to educate newly freed enslaved people about their voting rights.\n\nOn its first anniversary in 1866, a large procession took place in Galveston, drawing hundreds of men, women, and children. In Houston, African American community leaders and businessmen gathered funds to buy 10 acres of land for a commemorative site, which eventually became known as Emancipation Park.\n\nToday, Celebrations of Juneteenth have evolved and vary widely across the country. For some families and friends, the holiday is a reason to meet and rejoice over festive barbecue meals, music, and drinks.\n\nColour Red has been part of the Juneteenth menu for generations. It symbolises the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Other items include barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon, and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table, according to an AP report.\n\nWhile some celebrate Emancipation Day the traditional way and hold celebration marches, parades, and cultural performances.\n\nJust last week, the White House got an early start on Juneteenth and Black Music Month celebrations with a lively concert on the South Lawn. The event featured a star-studded lineup, including legendary singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle, who performed alongside artists from gospel, rap, jazz, and other genres. The event was also attended by Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, who danced on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin, as reported by the AP.\n\nFor some, the occasion is a day of rest and remembrance. Many people choose to engage in community service, attend educational panels and film screenings, or simply take the time off to commemorate the occasion.\n\nWhy has Juneteenth become so important?\n\nIn May 2020, the tragic death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man in the custody of Minneapolis police, ignited nationwide protests against racial injustice. These demonstrations fueled the momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement and triggered significant social and legislative changes.\n\nOne of the most notable outcomes was the signing of the 'Juneteenth National Independence Day Act' by President Joe Biden in 2021, officially making June 19 a federal holiday. This legislation received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, with only 14 House Republicans opposing it.\n\nLater in a White House briefing, President Biden remarked that establishing Juneteenth as a holiday was \"one of the greatest honors\" of his presidency.\n\nAs of today, at least 30 states and the District of Columbia recognise Juneteenth as a public holiday. According to the Pew Research Center, every state has at some point acknowledged Juneteenth as a day of observance, ensuring its commemoration even if it is not a designated day off.", "source":

Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth a solemn day of remembrance or more of a party?\n\nIt just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nFILE - President Joe Biden signs the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, June 17, 2021, in Washington.

Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nWhat if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are going on around the country?\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAre there special foods served on Juneteenth?\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nFILE - Julien James carries his son, Maison, 4, holding a Pan-African flag to celebrate during a Juneteenth commemoration at Leimert Park in Los Angeles Saturday, June 18, 2022. Many Americans are celebrating Juneteenth, marking the day in 1865 when the last enslaved people in the U.S. learned they were free. For generations, Black Americans have recognized the end of one of history's darkest chapters with joy, in the form of parades, street festivals, musical performances or cookouts. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren't Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way.\"\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin", "source": {"uri": "wccbcharlotte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCCB Charlotte's CW"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Juneteenth, which takes place on June 19, falls on Wednesday this year. While Juneteenth officially became America's twelfth federal holiday in 2021, it's been celebrated and observed by communities across the country for more than a century.\n\nTo recognize this special day, many business and service centers close. Oftentimes, local establishments, such as restaurants and stores also choose to keep their doors shut. However, some places, like Target, Best Buy and Starbucks, who do recognize Juneteenth as a company holiday, will still remain open. That's why it's always best to call a day or two beforehand to see what hours of operation businesses will be open on that day where you live, because they can vary by location.\n\nTo check out our list of what will be closed, keep reading. We include them all below as well as a brief rundown on the holiday.\n\nRelated: Get Ready for Freedom Day!

It's a crucial moment in our nation's history that marks our country's second independence day. Sometimes it's also referred to as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day.\n\nBack in 1865, on June 19, federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, and informed the 250,000 enslaved people there that they were free. To celebrate the end of slavery, this day became known as Juneteenth. However, it didn't officially become a national holiday until a few years ago.\n\n\"Today, we consecrate Juneteenth for what it ought to be, what it must be: a national holiday,\" President Biden exclaimed in his speech before signing the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act into law.\n\nIs the Post Office Closed on Juneteenth?\n\nMake sure you send out any cards or deadline-prone packages and letters before June 19, because the United States Post Office (USPS) will be closed across the country on Juneteenth. That also means that no mail will be delivered from them that day, so don't bother checking your mailbox that night. All services will resume the following day on Thursday, June 20.\n\nHowever, FedEx and UPS locations will be operating as normal, as well as providing pickup and delivery services that day.\n\nRelated: Recognizing This Significant Day in History -- Here Are 50 Quotes to Better Understand Juneteenth\n\nAre Banks Closed on Juneteenth?\n\nIf you need to cash a check or make a withdrawal, keep in mind that because Juneteenth is observed by the Federal Reserve, most major banks will be closed that day.

Only 17% said they knew a lot about the holiday.\n\nBlack Americans (32%) were more likely to say they knew a lot about the Juneteenth holiday versus Hispanics (22%) and whites (13%).\n\n\"Juneteenth symbolizes freedom and the fulfillment of emancipation promises, honoring African Americans' resilience against slavery,\" said Hopkins. \"It is the moment of freedom that formerly enslaved people in Texas can point to as the start of a new era of freedom.\"\n\nJuneteenth was created by putting the word June and nineteenth together to commemorate the day in which the 250,000 slaves in Galveston were given the declaration by Union Army General Gordon Granger that they were officially free. The date has been celebrated by the Black community for more than 150 years as America's second Independence Day. It was first recognized as a state holiday in Texas in 1980 and in 2021 was enacted as a federal holiday.\n\n\"Though originating in Texas, Juneteenth National Independence Day has grown into a nationwide cultural holiday, gaining federal recognition in 2021 as a day of reflection on African American heritage, civil rights, and ongoing struggles for equality amid discussions about racial justice and historical injustices in America,\" said Hopkins.\n\n\"This was the first national holiday added to the federal calendar since MLK's birthday in 1983!\" she added, referring to civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nBut neither the abolition of slavery nor the enactment of Juneteenth as a federal holiday have ended racism in the US. In fact, the recognition of Juneteenth comes at a tipping point in America where racial strife has become a powder keg in politics between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nPresident Biden addressed those concerns amid the Juneteenth celebrations at the White House, warning of \"old ghosts in new garments trying to take us back,\" referring to Republicans making it harder for Black people to vote and attacking diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.\n\n\"I don't think we can talk about the elevation of Juneteenth to a national holiday without also recognizing that the social and political climate during 2020-2021 required the nation as a whole to grapple with the inconsistencies of the promise of freedom for African Americans,\" said Hopkins. \"In that moment, we say millions of people discover -- and rediscover -- this AMERICAN history.\"\n\nOver the past several years, cultural debate has raged in America over the history of slavery and how it should be taught in schools. In addition, the teaching of critical race theory \u00e2\u20ac\" which states that racial bias is inherent in many parts of Western society, especially in its legal and social institutions, on the basis of their having been primarily designed for and implemented by white people -- has been banned in many teaching institutions from high school to college.\n\n\"One thing we must recognize about Juneteenth is that it serves multiple purposes for people,\" Hopkins explained. \"It allows a space for African American communities to create cultural traditions to honor their ancestors who suffered under the lash during enslavement. It is also a uniquely American celebration that commemorates the moment freedmen turned towards a hopeful future and the promise of freedom.\"\n\nThe high-profile deaths of Black people at the hands of police have also contributed to racial sparring in the United States. The murder of George Floyd, a Black man who was killed by white police officer Derek Chauvin in the state of Minnesota in 2020 after Chauvin kneeled on Floyd's neck for nearly 10 minutes until he died, has also made America more aware of racism and police brutality against Blacks.\n\nThe celebration of Juneteenth might be the remedy to soothe racial tensions that have re-escalated in the US, or at least bring a better understanding of the difficult plight that Black people in America have faced throughout history.\n\nHopkins implores that Juneteenth should be embraced by everyone in the United States.\n\n\"In the contemporary moment, it provides an opportunity for all Americans to learn more about our history and build community,\" she said.\n\n\"Juneteenth honors a once-enslaved people's resilience and highlights America's ongoing journey toward equality and justice.\" -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Haberler.com"}, "authors": [],

In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans\u00b4 true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nFILE - Crystal Baziel holds the Pan-African flag Monday, June 19, 2023, during Reedy Chapel A.M.E Church's annual Juneteenth Family Fun Day, in Galveston, Texas. Many Americans are celebrating Juneteenth, marking the day in 1865 when the last enslaved people in the U.S. learned they were free. For generations, Black Americans have recognized the end of one of history's darkest chapters with joy, in the form of parades, street festivals, musical performances or cookouts. (Jennifer Reynolds/The Galveston County Daily News via AP, File)\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it\u00b4s a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I\u00b4ll watch what\u00b4s on the television, and I\u00b4m gonna rest,\u00b4\" Anderson said. \"I don\u00b4t want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn\u00b4t learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven\u00b4t known about it - who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn\u00b4t celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn\u00b4t a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn\u00b4t have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you\u00b4ll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth\u00b4s history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there\u00b4s no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you\u00b4re not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn\u00b4t this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it\u00b4s new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you\u00b4re really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you\u00b4re struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there\u00b4s one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that\u00b4s not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we\u00b4re celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIt\u00b4s typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas\u00b4 to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas\u00b4 from everybody. This is the same way.\"\n\nTang, who reported from Phoenix, is a member of The Associated Press\u00b4 Race and Ethnicity team.

President Joe Biden made the federal holiday official when he signed the Juneteenth National Independence Act into law on June 17, 2021.\n\nBut, this day that marks the end of slavery in the United States dates back to 1865 and people have been celebrating this freedom ever since in communities across the South.\n\nHere's a look at the history of Juneteenth, interesting facts about emancipation in South Carolina, and a list of related children's books.\n\nIn 1863, during the American Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared more than 3 million slaves living in the Confederate states to be free. More than two years would pass, however, before the news reached African Americans living in Texas. It was not until Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, that the last community of enslaved people learned that slavery had been abolished.\n\nAlso called Emancipation Day or Jubilee Day, the name Juneteenth comes from combining the words \"June\" and \"nineteenth,\" referencing the date that the proclamation was announced in Texas. The first official Juneteenth celebrations took place in that state, and it became an annual tradition among African Americans to gather with family and commemorate their freedom through prayer and religious services, speeches, educational events, picnics, and festivals with music and dancing. Juneteenth even became a state holiday in Texas in 1980.\n\nThe Emancipation Oak in South Carolina\n\nThe Reconstruction Era National Historical Park - made up of historical sites in Beaufort, South Carolina, and the surrounding Sea Islands - includes the Emancipation Oak, located in Port Royal on what was once known as Camp Saxton.\n\nOn January 1, 1863, Camp Saxton was the scene of elaborate ceremonies to announce the Emancipation Proclamation, which was read in a grove of live oak trees before a crowd of more than 5,000 people, made up of soldiers, military officials, guest speakers, formerly enslaved people and freed men, women and children.\n\nAccording to the National Park Service, this Emancipation Proclamation celebration was significant because it occurred in Union-occupied territory in the South where the provisions of the proclamation would actually take effect before the end of the Civil War.\n\n10 Books for learning about Juneteenth\n\nElementary School:\n\n\"Juneteenth: A Children's Story\" by Opal Lee\"The Juneteenth Story: Celebrating the End of Slavery in the United States\" by Alliah L.

What do I say? What do I do? A starter guide to the federal holiday", "body": "This year's Juneteenth will be the fourth since the day was recognized as a federal holiday, yet there is still some confusion over the holiday, what its purpose is and how to take part in celebrations.\n\nBefore you can observe Juneteenth, you should know why it's significant. Once you understand the history, you can look at possible celebrations and decide what's best for you.\n\nCelebrating Juneteenth has been a tradition in Texas for years. It was the first state to make the day an official holiday in 1980. It's a common tradition in the Lone Star State to sip on red soda or juice, which is ripe with historical meaning.\n\nJuneteenth commemorates the emancipation of slaves in Galveston, Texas on June 19, 1865. It is a common misconception that all slaves were freed through the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. In reality, this enactment was only the first step. It was followed by Union troops informing slaves of the proclamation and the creation of further legal rights for Black people in America.\n\nGeneral Gordon Granger rode in with his men to inform slaves that they had been freed. The last announcement from Union generals took place in Galveston, meaning they were the last to hear of their freedom and the end of the war, according to Scott Finnie, an expert in Africana Studies at Eastern Washington University. Communities of Black Americans have since celebrated June 19.\n\nThe holiday reminds everyone that slavery was abolished, yet freedom was not granted for many for over two years.\n\nThe day is a celebration of freedom. It is also a day to bring to light ongoing issues and efforts for true freedom, a day for activism, for remembrance, for increased awareness.\n\nCan I say Happy Juneteenth?\n\nThis is debated in Black communities. Some people would rather not hear the phrase at all, while others think it is okay to say indiscriminately on a social media post or as a general statement. This stems from the possible microaggressions of exclusively saying \"Happy Juneteenth\" to Black people in particular. It's considered presumptive, as not all Black people are African Americans who resonate with the day.\n\nThere are many ways to celebrate Juneteenth, and each individual will resonate with certain traditions over others. According to the official Juneteenth website, what's important is that your commemoration of Juneteenth is \"celebratory, festive and in honor of African American history.\" The site also maintains a list of celebration ideas.\n\nA big part of recognizing Juneteenth is spreading awareness. If you can't take part in Juneteenth in any other way, it is enough to teach the people in your life what the day is about. Educate others and yourself with resources like these.\n\nAdditionally, you can support Black-owned businesses and attend Juneteenth events in your area.", "source": {"uri": "thenewstribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Washington_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Washington University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_Abolition_Act_1833", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slavery Abolition Act 1833"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abolitionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African-American history"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.thenewstribune.com/latest-news/d5rzbz/picture262670347/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/220618%20cb%20Juneteenth_12.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 1387, "textEnd": 1394}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 703, "textEnd": 710}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIt just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It honors freedom for all.", "body": "Here's why this once local celebration is significant to U.S. history.\n\nJuneteenth, a federal holiday on June 19 commemorating the emancipation of enslaved Black people, represents far more than a milestone in Black history - it is a pivotal moment in American history as a whole. Yet, when I asked some of my white family members and friends what they were doing for Juneteenth, their reply surprised me: \"We're just celebrating Fourth of July.\"\n\nThe Fourth of July celebrates our nation's independence from Great Britain and our nation's existence as an independent sovereign nation. The observance of Juneteenth, on the other hand, celebrates the freedom of each and every individual American. Consequently, Juneteenth should not be celebrated by the Black community alone; it demands the participation and reflection of all Americans.\n\nWhy we should celebrate Juneteenth\n\nEmbracing Juneteenth universally underscores our collective responsibility to acknowledge and learn from the historical injustices that have shaped our present society.\n\nJuneteenth commemorates the day in 1865 when Union Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, and announced the end of slavery, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. This delay in freedom for many enslaved people highlights the complexity and uneven enforcement of law and liberty, themes that resonate deeply within the broader American narrative.\n\nCelebrating Juneteenth nationwide allows all Americans to reflect on these themes and recognize that freedom is a journey toward equality that is ongoing and shared by all Americans.\n\nAmerican history can't be rewritten: How early US presidents failed enslaved people\n\nThe celebration of Juneteenth also aligns with America's foundational ideals of liberty, justice and the pursuit of happiness. These values are not exclusive to any one group but are intended to be universal.\n\nBy observing Juneteenth, we reaffirm our commitment to these principles and acknowledge where we have fallen short. This reflection is crucial for fostering a more inclusive society where every individual is free not merely from iron shackles, but also from the more abstract shackles that a nation may impose on its people.\n\nRecognizing Juneteenth on a national scale provides an opportunity to educate ourselves about a significant period in U.S. history that has often been distorted or inadequately covered in traditional curricula.\n\nUnderstanding the full scope of American history - including its darker chapters - ensures a more comprehensive national identity that empowers us to build a future informed by the lessons of the past.\n\nWho can celebrate Juneteenth? It shouldn't be seen as a 'Black holiday.'\n\nMoreover, celebrating Juneteenth as a unified nation can foster greater empathy and solidarity across diverse communities. It sends the message that we are one America that values freedom for all, and that while much progress has been made since 1865, racial disparities still plague us today and operate to curtail the freedoms of some.\n\nThe collective observance of Juneteenth encourages dialogue about racial justice - conversations that are essential for meaningful societal change.\n\nEmbrace Juneteenth: Should conservatives celebrate Juneteenth? Federal holiday honors a victory for America.\n\nIn practical terms, national recognition of Juneteenth offers an occasion for public events that promote cultural exchange, mutual respect and understanding. Festivals, educational programs and community gatherings can bring together individuals from different backgrounds to celebrate the full integration of Black citizens into our democracy.\n\nSuch events can break down barriers and build bridges between communities. When communities come together to mark this day, it sends a powerful message that the fight against racism is a collective effort of all Americans. It reinforces the idea that racial justice is integral to the maintenance of our democracy.\n\nCelebrating Juneteenth is not a rejection of the Fourth of July.

Here's what to know about the holiday and why it's celebrated", "body": "For more than one-and-a-half centuries, the holiday, set for June 19, has been sacred to many Black communities\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday is set to take place this week, marking its third year as a federal holiday in the U.S., but the celebrations are far from new.\n\nFor more than one-and-a-half centuries, the holiday, set for June 19, has been sacred to many Black communities.\n\nSince it was designated a federal holiday in 2021, Juneteenth has become more universally recognized beyond Black America. Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up history, here are some answers:\n\nJuneteenth marks the day in 1865 enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, found out they had been freed -- after the end of the Civil war, and two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nJuneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues.\n\nIn the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start.\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" said Freeman, the comedian.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other? You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way,\" Freeman said.\n\nNo matter what race you are, you will \"absolutely\" elicit a smile if you utter either greeting, he said.\n\n\"I believe that a non-Black person who celebrates Juneteenth ... it's their one time to have a voice, to participate.\"\n\nThe holiday, set for June 19, will lead to closures of many facilities, while others will remain unaffected.\n\nMail Service\n\nJuneteenth is included in holidays observed by the United States Postal Service, meaning that no mail delivery will occur and all post offices will be closed.\n\nBanks\n\nBanks that observe federal holidays, including Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo and others, will be closed for the day on June 19.\n\nState, Federal Buildings\n\nAll state and federal facilities, including Department of Motor Vehicles offices and courthouses, will be closed for the holiday.\n\nTrash Service\n\nMost communities observe federal holidays for trash pickup, including the city of Chicago. According to the city's website, there will be no residential trash pickup on June 19, but there will be recycling service available in select areas.\n\nChicago Public Schools locations and offices will be closed in observance of the holiday. No summer programming will be held on that date, according to officials.\n\nPublic schools that have summer classes will also be closed on the holiday, though private schools may choose to be open. Be sure to check your district's website for more information.\n\nRetail Stores\n\nMost retailers are open for Juneteenth, but some may have abbreviated hours. Shoppers are encouraged to check the websites of their favorite stores to see if their hours are im", "source": {"uri": "nbcchicago.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Chicago"}, "authors": [],

Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIt just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com",

The museum will continue America's tradition of honoring Juneteenth, or Freedom Day, with celebrations across the country that honor Black Americans' contributions to society and resilience in overcoming a history of enslavement.\n\nThe museum's target opening date comes four years after President Biden signed a law in 2021 making June 19 a federal holiday, and 160 years after news reached Texas that \"all persons held as slaves\" were free.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation January 1, 1863, at the height of the U.S. Civil War. The proclamation was largely ignored in Texas until Union Army General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston June 19, 1865, with troops to deliver and enforce the federal order.\n\nAs African Americans reconnected with loved ones separated by slavery, Juneteenth celebrations took hold, beginning in Texas in 1866. Texas recognized Juneteenth as a state holiday in 1980, and additional states followed in the coming years and decades.\n\nJuneteenth celebrations occur across the United States, with family reunions remaining a central feature, along with food, music and poetry. In 2022, celebrations in Atlanta included a parade and free concerts, while Inglewood, California, near Los Angeles, showcased live performances and a children's art space.\n\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington holds a community day to celebrate Juneteenth with history, stories and live jazz. And on June 10, Biden hosted a Juneteenth celebration at the White House featuring performers including Doug E. Fresh, Trombone Shorty, Gladys Knight and Roy Wood Jr.\n\nOpal Lee, 97, known as the \"grandmother of Juneteenth,\" has said she hopes people of all races will embrace the National Juneteenth Museum as a symbol of freedom. The 4,645-square-meter facility will serve as an epicenter of Juneteenth education, historical preservation and celebration.\n\n\"The museum will be a learning experience for all,\" said museum board legacy member Dione Sims. \"We hope to help the nation and the world find themselves in the Juneteenth story.\"", "source": {"uri": "share.america.gov", "dataType": "news", "title": "ShareAmerica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_monsen@share.america.gov", "name": "Lauren Monsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opal Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Wood_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roy Wood Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_E._Fresh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug E.

The word was created by joining the words \"June\" and \"nineteenth\" together.\n\nWATCH: What you need to know about Juneteenth\n\nYes - though it took decades to happen.\n\nJuneteenth was first recognised as a state holiday in Texas in 1980. In the years afterwards, every state but South Dakota formally went on to recognise Juneteenth as a state or ceremonial holiday.\n\nWhen he was senator for Illinois, Barack Obama co-sponsored legislation to make Juneteenth a national holiday, but the law was never passed - even after he became president.\n\nBut the legislation gained momentum after Black Lives Matter protests around the country in the summer of 2020.\n\nIn the lead-up to 19 June 2021, both chambers of the US Congress moved swiftly to pass the bill and - with the signature of President Biden, it became law.\n\nIt was the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr Day was established in 1983.\n\nAmong the campaigners for a federal holiday were Opal Lee, who, at age 89, walked from Texas to Washington DC in 2016 to raise awareness and persuade lawmakers.\n\nShe walked 2.5 miles (4km) each day - representing the two-and-a-half years it took for enslaved people in Texas to learn they had been freed.\n\nMs Lee spoke of her \"many different feelings\" after Congress approved the new federal holiday.\n\n\"I don't know what to call them all,\" she said. \"I am so delighted to know that suddenly we've got a Juneteenth.\n\n\"It's not a Texas thing or a black thing. It's an American thing.\"\n\nUS government offices close for Juneteenth, as do any private businesses that participate.\n\nAs for whether state government employees get a paid day off - that depends on whether state authorities mark Juneteenth as a state holiday, a day of observance or something in between. It is a varied picture.\n\nSimilarly, celebrations and traditions differ across the US. In some states there are parades, festivals and block parties where people gather to share food and play games.\n\nAs well as public readings and singing, picnics and church services, in some states rodeos, contests, concerts and parades are also organised.\n\nFood also plays an important part, with barbecues being one of the most popular ways of marking the day with family and friends.\n\nMany people choose to shop at black-owned businesses or eat at black-owned restaurants.\n\nOthers elect to attend solemn or reflective events that call attention to ongoing racial inequality.\n\nThe ending of slavery did not end racism, and in the years after emancipation, so-called Jim Crow laws were created to separate black people from white society and limit their civil rights.\n\nThe legacy of those laws is still being dismantled.\n\nThe deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other African Americans at the hands of police have spurred anti-racism protests.\n\nIt also comes as a cultural debate rages over the history of slavery and how it should be taught in American schools.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is a federal holiday,\" Michael Harris, a member of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation-California, previously told The Bee. \"To have a law that's quasi-optional makes no sense. This is the only federal holiday that's treated this way.\"\n\nThough Juneteenth is a recognized federal and state holiday, California law does not require employers to give days off for Juneteenth.\n\nHowever, private employers can choose to observe the holiday, CalChamber Alert reported.\n\nCalifornia law does not require employers to provide employees with paid days off for holidays or to give \"holiday pay\" for working on holidays.\n\nIt is entirely up to California employers to decide whether to offer their employees a paid or unpaid holiday for Juneteenth or any other holiday.", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angela_rodriguez@sacbee.com", "name": "Angela Rodriguez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Freedom_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Freedom Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_Employees_International_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Service Employees International Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sacramento_Bee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sacramento Bee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Government Agencies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.sacbee.com/latest-news/ah0f06/picture276127111/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SAC_RCB_20230605_Transgender-Prayer0602.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-15", "textStart": 225, "textEnd": 232}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 24, "textEnd": 31}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

We've got answers.\n\nWhat is Juneteenth?\n\nOn June 19, 1865, two months after the Civil War officially ended, the last Black slaves of the Confederacy were ordered free when Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas. The day became known as Juneteenth and, for a long time, it was only observed in Texas.\n\nOver the years, though, the day of remembrance began to spread. It came to national prominence following the 2020 unrest that followed the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nWhen is Juneteenth?\n\nJuneteenth is celebrated on June 19. On years where it falls on a weekend day, it will be celebrated the following Monday.\n\nAre banks open on Juneteenth?\n\nNo. Juneteenth is a federal holiday, meaning banks will be closed. Online banking and ATMs will still be operational, but deposits won't be processed until the banks reopen.\n\nFederal offices will be closed on June 19. It's also an official holiday in all 50 states (and the District of Columbia).\n\nAre any retail and grocery stores closed on Juneteenth?\n\nNot many.

It became a U.S. federal holiday in 2021, following the signing of a bill by President Joe Biden. Long a regional holiday in the South, Juneteenth rose in prominence across the country following 2020 protests over the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and other African Americans.\n\nJuneteenth, a combination of the words June and 19th, is also known as Emancipation Day. It commemorates the day in 1865 - after the Confederate states surrendered to end the Civil War - when a Union general arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform a group of enslaved African Americans of their freedom under President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nTexas officially declared Juneteenth a holiday in 1980. At least 28 states and the District of Columbia now legally recognize Juneteenth as state holidays and give state workers a paid day off. Although in part a celebration, the day is also observed solemnly to honor those who suffered as a result of slavery in the 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colonies that would eventually become the United States.\n\nNow in its fourth year as a federal holiday, all U.S. government employees and any private business that participates have the day off from work. Not all state governments recognize the holiday, however, meaning state employees in those states are expected to work. To enshrine Juneteenth in any state, its legislature would have to pass bills to make it a permanent holiday.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-is-juneteenth-how-are-people-marking-day-2023-06-19/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic slave trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thirteen Colonies"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 97, "textEnd": 104}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

What is it, and what does it represent?", "body": "If you walk around downtown Milwaukee this week, you may notice a new-ish flag flying underneath the Stars and Stripes outside City Hall.\n\nThis red and blue flag featuring a white star and sunburst in the middle is the Juneteenth flag. It has flown at Milwaukee's City Hall every year since 2020 and is a symbolic representation of the end of slavery in the United States.\n\nThe flag flies in honor of Juneteenth, the recently established federal holiday celebrating the final end of slavery in the U.S.\n\nHere's what the Juneteenth flag represents and what to know about the holiday.\n\nWhat does the Juneteenth flag represent?\n\nThe Juneteenth flag was originally designed in 1997 by Ben Haith, activist and founder of the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation, and illustrated by Lisa Jeanne Graf.\n\nEach element of the flag represents an aspect of Black American freedom. According to Graf, the red, white and blue color palette is a reminder that enslaved people and their descendants were and are Americans. The red also represents the blood shed by those who've fought for freedom.\n\nThe white star in the flag's center has two meanings, Haith told CNN. First, it represents Texas, the Lone Star State, where Union soldiers informed the country's last remaining enslaved people that they were free in 1865. The star also represents the freedom of Black people in all 50 states.\n\nThe sunburst surrounding the star is meant to resemble a nova, a term astronomers use for a new star. On the flag, this represents the new beginnings of freedom. The arc shape dividing the red and blue sections represents \"a new horizon\" of opportunities and promise that lay ahead for Black Americans.\n\nFinally, many versions of the flags include the date \"June 19, 1865,\" written in white text. This was the day soldiers informed those last enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, of their freedom.\n\nWhen is Juneteenth?\n\nJuneteenth takes place on June 19 each year. In 2024, the holiday falls on a Wednesday.\n\nWhat is Juneteenth?\n\nJuneteenth, officially Juneteenth National Independence Day, commemorates the end of slavery in the United States.\n\nOn June 19, 1865, Union Army soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, with the news that the Civil War was over and all slaves were free. This was two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.

Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth a solemn day of remembrance or more of a party?\n\nIt just depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nWhat if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are going on around the country?\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAre there special foods served on Juneteenth?\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren't Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way.\"\n\n___\n\nTang, who reported from Phoenix, is a member of The Associated Press' Race and Ethnicity team.

Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post\n\nOn June 19, the United States observes Juneteenth to commemorate the end of slavery, a painful chapter in the nation's history whose legacy continues to reverberate. Juneteenth - a combination of the words \"June\" and \"nineteenth\" - has been celebrated for decades by Black communities as Emancipation Day, but the recent broader reckoning over racial injustices and deepening political polarization has thrust the day further into national and cultural prominence.\n\nMany states and cities plan festivities to mark Juneteenth, which is often celebrated with parades, street parties and cookouts. The day is a historic one for American history, civil rights activists say, and memorializing it reaffirms the country's quest for equality.\n\nWhat is Juneteenth and its history?\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 freed enslaved people in Confederate states, but it did not immediately end slavery in places such as Texas that remained under Confederate control. Two and a half years later, on June 19, 1865, Union troops led by Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Tex., and announced that more than 250,000 enslaved Black people in the state were free. (Nationwide emancipation would come only with the ratification of the 13th Amendment later that year.)\n\nFor Black people, the news was a moment of \"indescribable joy\" that was met with large celebrations in Texas, historian C.R. Gibbs told The Washington Post. Also known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, Juneteenth Independence Day and Black Independence Day, the day remains deeply significant for the community.\n\nJune 19 became a kind of July 4 celebration for African Americans, john a. powell (who does not capitalize his name), the director of the Othering and Belonging Institute at the University of California at Berkeley, told The Post.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's particularly important for African Americans because they are still struggling for freedom and equality. But June 19 was a momentous day to mark that next chapter that we embarked on,\" he said.\n\nRecognizing history, powell added, is part of the process. \"We can't make progress unless we have knowledge (of) where we are and where we have been,\" he said.\n\nFor Annette Gordon-Reed, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and the author of \"On Juneteenth,\" the day commemorates an advancement in human rights. \"It represents the hope that the country can strive to be better, and work to perfect the Union,\" she told The Post.\n\nHow is Juneteenth commemorated?\n\nTexas was the center of major Juneteenth festivities for decades, but the traditions have spread across the country in recent years. The initial celebrations around Juneteenth were used to teach newly freed enslaved people about voting rights.\n\nIts first anniversary, in 1866, was marked by a large procession in Galveston that was attended by hundreds of men, women and children. In Houston, community leaders pooled money to purchase land for a commemoration site, which came to be known as Emancipation Park.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGordon-Reed, a Texas native, said the day is about coming together as a family and as a community to cook and eat together.\n\n\"At more public celebrations, there are speeches and poetry. It's a festive occasion, but the underlying importance of the day is emphasized,\" she added.\n\nJuneteenth celebrations are associated with a rich and distinct culinary tradition and often feature red-colored drinks and food items, including barbecue and, more recently, red velvet cake. Among the most beloved drinks is a ruby-hued elixir based on African hibiscus ginger tea, master herbalist Sunyatta Amen once wrote for The Post. Enslaved people from Africa carried a wide variety of plants and crops, including hibiscus, to the Americas, and the drink became a potent reminder of home.\n\nThis year, Galveston will screen a documentary film and host a live music event and lectures through the week on the history of Juneteenth. In D.C., the National Archives will put two historic papers, including the Emancipation Proclamation, on public display. Scotland, a historically African American community in Montgomery County, Md., that was founded by formerly enslaved people, will host a parade and a car show.\n\nSydnee Martin, left, dances and sings with Trianna Downing, center, and her twin sister, Morgan Downing, during Juneteenth celebrations on June 19, 2023, at Black Lives Matter Plaza along 16th Street NW in D.C. Matt McClain/The Washington Post\n\nWhen was Juneteenth declared a federal holiday?\n\nIn 2021, President Biden signed into law the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act - which marked June 19 as a federal holiday - during nationwide racial justice demonstrations that swept the country after the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe measure received overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress, with only 14 House Republicans voting against it. Opponents of the bill called it an attempt to celebrate identity politics and to remake the country's ideology with critical race theory - which examines the way policies and laws perpetuate systemic racism - at its center.\n\nEstablishing Juneteenth as a holiday, Biden said in his remarks, would be \"one of the greatest honors\" of his presidency.\n\nAround him stood members of the Congressional Black Caucus; Vice President Harris, the first woman of color to hold the office; as well as activist Opal Lee, who had campaigned for the day to be made into a national holiday.\n\n\"We have come far, and we have far to go. But today is a day of celebration,\" Harris said at the event. \"It is not only a day of pride, it is also a day for us to reaffirm and rededicate ourselves to action.\"\n\nCivil rights groups welcomed the move. \"It is a reminder that freedom is an ongoing fight,\" NAACP President Derrick Johnson said at the time.\n\nWhich states observe Juneteenth as a holiday?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt least 30 states and the District of Columbia recognize Juneteenth as a public holiday.\n\nTexas was the first state to pass legislation, making it a state holiday in January 1980. Texas House Bill 1016, first introduced in early 1979, declared Emancipation Day a legal holiday. Kansas and Rhode Island are some of the latest states to mark Juneteenth as a state holiday. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear (D) signed an executive order in May designating Juneteenth a state holiday.\n\nIn Alabama, a new bill, H.B. 4, would make Juneteenth a state holiday, although state employees would be able to choose between recognizing Juneteenth or the birthday of the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, on June 3. A similar effort is underway in Alaska, where a bill making June 19 a state holiday is awaiting the governor's nod.\n\nEvery state has at some point recognized Juneteenth at least as a day of observance - meaning it is commemorated even if it is not a day off, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nWhat's closed on Juneteenth?\n\nThe Federal Reserve and its branches will be closed Wednesday, and some major commercial banks including Bank of America and Wells Fargo will be shut. Federal courts will be closed, although the electronic filing system will be available.\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday for U.S. Postal Service employees. Pickup and delivery services will be available at UPS and FedEx locations. It is also a U.S. stock market holiday.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nRepublicans block bill to outlaw bump stocks after Supreme Court lifts

On one hand, it's mind-blowing to see the accomplishments of our people. On the other hand, as we journey deeper into the past, it can become unfathomable to imagine the depths of what our ancestors endured.\n\nDespite all of that, one thing synonymous with Black people is celebration. Even in trying times, we have always found a way to persevere and celebrate the gift of life and community. Recognized on June 19, Juneteenth (also referred to as Freedom Day, Juneteenth Independence Day, or Emancipation Day) is a holiday that reflects the celebration tradition through street festivals, musical performances, parades, speeches, marches, and delicious food.\n\nSo, What Exactly Is Juneteenth?\n\n\"Juneteenth\" blends two words: June and nineteenth. It marks the date (June 19, 1865) that enslaved Africans in Galveston, Texas, were made aware of their freedom, which had been granted two years prior in 1863, after the Emancipation Proclamation. Yes, two whole years prior. For context, Lincoln's proclamation to free slaves was only applied to certain states. We must also remember that enslavement was a lucrative industry for owners who used Black men, women, and children to perform forced and unpaid labor, especially during harvest season. Without their work, enslavers stood to lose crops and money. Therefore, many simply did not inform them of their freedom.\n\nHowever, two months after the Civil War ended, Union General Gordan Granger and 2,000 of his troops arrived in Galveston to bring forth the news that slavery had ended. Reading the official decree (General Order No. 3), nearly 250,000 Texans were free. In an interview conducted by the Federal Writers Project in 1937, Preely Coleman recalled his former owner telling him and other field workers, \"You all are free as I am,\" prompting them to \"shout and sing\" in celebration. As word spread throughout other plantations and the city, similar celebrations erupted. This made Galveston, Texas, the birthplace of Juneteenth.\n\nThe Journey From Local to Federal Recognition\n\nAs Black Texans began to migrate to other parts of the United States (and even parts of Mexico), the celebration went with them. Though it's been honored in various cities for decades, it wasn't widely recognized, not even in Texas. Marching alongside leaders like Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Rev. Jesse Jackson for civil rights, late state representative Al Edwards, also known as the Father of Juneteenth, understood the importance of having Juneteenth honored at a higher level. In 1980, after Edward's advocacy and legislation support, Texas became the first state to recognize Juneteenth as an official state holiday.\n\nIn 2016, the Grandmother of Juneteenth, Opal Lee, embarked on a journey at age 89 to walk the 1400 miles from Fort Worth, Texas to Washington, D.C. on a mission to make the celebration a federal holiday. In 2021, the efforts of Edwards, Lee, and other activists were rewarded when President Biden declared Juneteenth a federal holiday.\n\nKey Juneteenth Celebrations in Galveston\n\nGalveston is a great place to visit year-round to embrace Black History and culture. They have several guided and self-guided tours, monuments, and historic markers throughout the city. Their Juneteenth activations magnify community members' efforts to bring awareness, education, and truth to the events of June 19, enslavement, and beyond.\n\nMany early Juneteenth celebrations centered on gatherings at churches. As General Gordan Granger went through the city to read the decree, Reedy Chapel AME Church was his last stop, making it one of the early celebration sites. Each year, the church hosts an Emancipation March that reenacts freed slaves jubilantly marching from the church to the local courthouse. This year's event will be at 6 p.m. on June 19.\n\nThe Reading of General Order No. 3 happens annually at Galveston's official Juneteenth Marker in Ashton Villa. This year's event will be on June 19 at 10 a.m. While in Ashton Villa, visitors can view the \"And Still We Rise\" exhibit. The exhibit chronicles the story of Juneteenth in Galveston using interviews, photos, audio clippings, and other artifacts.\n\nWhat's a celebration without a parade? Galveston's annual Juneteenth Festival includes live music from local artists, art from Black vendors, and food trucks. It all kicked off with a parade on June 17. The festival feels like a big family reunion.\n\nWhy Should We Be Celebrating Juneteenth?\n\nAs we contend with the erasure of Black History from school curriculums (or forced to present a palatable, white-washed version) at multiple academic levels, it's even more critical that we honor and celebrate Juneteenth within our communities. It is a way to honor our ancestors' plight, carry on their traditions, and forge new paths for future generations.", "source": {"uri": "essence.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Essence"},

The executive order outlawed slavery in Confederate states beginning Jan. 1, 1863, the midpoint of the Civil War. The holiday rose to prominence in 2020 amid the nationwide protests about racial inequality after the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia, Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minnesota.

It commemorates the day in 1865 - after the Confederate states surrendered to end the Civil War.\n\nTexas officially declared Juneteenth a holiday in 1980.\n\nJuneteenth, a day that marks the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans, is always observed on June 19 each year. It became a U.S. federal holiday in 2021, following the signing of a bill by President Joe Biden.\n\nLong a regional holiday in the South, Juneteenth rose in prominence across the country following 2020 protests over the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and other African Americans.\n\nWHEN IS JUNETEENTH?\n\nJuneteenth, a combination of the words June and 19th, is also known as Emancipation Day. It commemorates the day in 1865 - after the Confederate states surrendered to end the Civil War - when a Union general arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform a group of enslaved African Americans of their freedom under President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nTexas officially declared Juneteenth a holiday in 1980. At least 28 states and the District of Columbia now legally recognize Juneteenth as state holidays and give state workers a paid day off.\n\nAlthough in part a celebration, the day is also observed solemnly to honor those who suffered as a result of slavery in the 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colonies that would eventually become the United States.\n\nWHAT IS SIGNIFICANT ABOUT JUNETEENTH THIS YEAR?\n\nNow in its fourth year as a federal holiday, all U.S. government employees and any private business that participates have the day off from work.\n\nNot all state governments recognize the holiday, however, meaning state employees in those states are expected to work. To enshrine Juneteenth in any state, its legislature would have to pass bills to make it a permanent holiday.\n\nIn 2023, Connecticut, Minnesota, Nevada and Tennessee made Juneteenth a permanent public holiday for the first time, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nAlabama Governor Kay Ivey authorized Juneteenth this year to be a state holiday by decree, after efforts by state lawmakers to pass legislation to make it a permanent state holiday.\n\nRace remains a sensitive issue in the United States, four years after tensions flared over the killing of George Floyd and other Black Americans at the hands of police. Floyd's killing sparked a global protest movement that led to calls for sweeping criminal justice reform and attention to other racial inequities.\n\nIn Florida and other states, some conservatives are trying to change the way Black history is taught in public schools, another sign of the deep tensions that still surround race in the United States, which imposed a draconian system of racial segregation on Black Americans following emancipation.\n\nSince Juneteenth 2023, the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer consider race as a factor in deciding on student admissions.\n\nThe decision ended affirmative action programs that have been used by many U.S. schools to increase their numbers of Black, Hispanic and other students from underrepresented communities.\n\nHOW ARE PEOPLE MARKING JUNETEENTH?\n\nAmericans are marking the 159th anniversary of emancipation with festive meals, music and gatherings. Traditionally, celebrations have included parades and marches, many of which were held on Sunday.\n\nPeople are also celebrating the holiday by organizing for civil rights, reading books about African American heritage and history, attending festivals and musical performances, and dining at Black-owned restaurants.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nMeanwhile, other events will strike a more somber tone, with organizers using the day to draw attention to today's racial inequities they say stem from the legacy of slavery and structural racism.\n\n(Except for the

It's back.\n\nBlack History, Juneteenth becoming more cemented in fabric of US\n\nAlthough Juneteenth is now becoming a part of the conversation regarding Black History, there was a time when Black History was not widely discussed within the educational system, especially for historians, said Dr. Alan Singer, a professor of teaching, learning and technology at Hofstra University who writes about the history of slavery and racism.\n\n\"I didn't learn it (until) I was an adult, really (in the) 1990s, when as a teacher, I started studying more, so I (could) incorporate it into my lessons,\" he said. \"I went to City College in the 1960s and they had first introduced a course called 'American Negro History' and that was the first time I had learned about any of these things. I took the course because I became a political activist while at City College and I needed to know more about the African American civil rights struggles.\"\n\nSinger also adds that he attended high school during the Civil Rights Movement and was never taught about Black History. To change that, he decided to educate himself more to properly teach his students.\n\n\"I just felt a heavy responsibility as a teacher to really present a much more accurate picture of the history of the United States,\" he said.\n\nGoler adds that Juneteenth has been recognized for years within the Black community and history. Now, the day has become more publicly known.\n\n\"In recent years, Juneteenth has gained a much wider recognition. It's only been since 2021 that it became that designated as a federal holiday,\" he said. \"Many Black people and Black communities around the country have celebrated Juneteenth. It's just becoming much more wider and much more visible now.\"\n\nCommercialization of Juneteenth\n\nSince Juneteenth has been declared a federal holiday, many retailers have unveiled Juneteenth attire through clothing, footwear, hats and other merchandise.\n\n\"The question is, 'who benefits from the commercialization of Juneteenth?' I'd definitely like to see more African American (and) more Black businesses benefit,\" Goler said. \"The trend of commercialization, we risk the overshadowing of the historical context, and the ongoing struggle for racial equality that Juneteenth represents.\"\n\nSinger hopes that companies that are selling Juneteenth products are also advocating for more inclusivity.\n\n\"What I'm arguing is that what we need to do is to use a day like Juneteenth as a launching pad to build a more just society,\" he said. \"It should not just be about the past, it has to be about the future.\"\n\nGoler hopes that the holiday will bring everyone together but also educate them about this important day in Black History.\n\n\"I think as we observe Juneteenth, it's important to focus on the education, reflection, the community engagement aspect and really ensure that the day remains of a pungent reminder of our continued and enduring fight for freedom and justice,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

Many Americans are celebrating Juneteenth, marking the day in 1865 when the last enslaved people in the U.S. learned they were free. For generations, Black Americans have recognized the end of one of history's darkest chapters with joy, in the form of parades, street festivals, musical performances or cookouts.\n\nTERRY TANG\n\nAssociated Press\n\nOBSERVING AMERICA'S NEWEST FEDERAL HOLIDAY\n\nFor more than one-and-a-half centuries, the Juneteenth holiday has been sacred to many Black communities.\n\nIt marks the day in 1865 enslaved people in Galveston, Texas found out they had been freed -- after the end of the Civil War, and two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nSince it was designated a federal holiday in 2021, Juneteenth has become more universally recognized beyond Black America. Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events.\n\nPeople who never gave the June 19 holiday more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nPeople are also reading...

Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance.\n\nThat can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nWhat if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are going on around the country?\n\nSearch online and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAre there special foods served on Juneteenth?\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren't Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian organizing a Juneteenth comedy festival in Galveston, Texas for the second straight year.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its

Know about federal holiday's origin history, significance and celebrations", "body": "Juneteenth, a day that marks the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans, is always observed on June 19 each year. It became a U.S. federal holiday in 2021, following the signing of a bill by President Joe Biden. Long a regional holiday in the South, Juneteenth rose in prominence across the country following 2020 protests over the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and other African Americans.\n\nJuneteenth, a combination of the words June and 19th, is also known as Emancipation Day. It commemorates the day in 1865 - after the Confederate states surrendered to end the Civil War - when a Union general arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform a group of enslaved African Americans of their freedom under President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nTexas officially declared Juneteenth a holiday in 1980. At least 28 states and the District of Columbia now legally recognize Juneteenth as state holidays and give state workers a paid day off.\n\nAlthough in part a celebration, the day is also observed solemnly to honor those who suffered as a result of slavery in the 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colonies that would eventually become the United States.\n\nNow in its fourth year as a federal holiday, all U.S. government employees and any private business that participates have the day off from work.\n\nNot all state governments recognize the holiday, however, meaning state employees in those states are expected to work. To enshrine Juneteenth in any state, its legislature would have to pass bills to make it a permanent holiday.\n\nIn 2023, Connecticut, Minnesota, Nevada and Tennessee made Juneteenth a permanent public holiday for the first time, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nAlabama Governor Kay Ivey authorized Juneteenth this year to be a state holiday by decree, after efforts by state lawmakers to pass legislation to make it a permanent state holiday.\n\nRace remains a sensitive issue in the United States, four years after tensions flared over the killing of George Floyd and other Black Americans at the hands of police. Floyd's killing sparked a global protest movement that led to calls for sweeping criminal justice reform and attention to other racial inequities.\n\nIn Florida and other states, some conservatives are trying to change the way Black history is taught in public schools, another sign of the deep tensions that still surround race in the United States, which imposed a draconian system of racial segregation on Black Americans following emancipation.\n\nSince Juneteenth 2023, the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer consider race as a factor in deciding on student admissions. The decision ended affirmative action programs that have been used by many U.S. schools to increase their numbers of Black, Hispanic and other students from underrepresented communities.\n\nAmericans are marking the 159th anniversary of emancipation with festive meals, music and gatherings. Traditionally, celebrations have included parades and marches, many of which were held on Sunday.\n\nPeople are also celebrating the holiday by organizing for civil rights, reading books about African American heritage and history, attending festivals and musical performances, and dining at Black-owned restaurants.\n\nMeanwhile, other events will strike a more somber tone, with organizers using the day to draw attention to today's racial inequities they say stem from the legacy of slavery and structural racism.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan

The first official observance of Juneteenth came in 1980, when Texas declared it a state holiday. Other communities across the U.S. slowly began to adopt the annual observance as a public holiday, eventually leading to all 50 states and the District of Columbia now recognizing the day in some form.\n\nThe drive to make Juneteenth a federal holiday gained momentum during the Black Lives Matter movement against racism and police brutality, especially after the murder of African American George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020.\n\nMuch of the success in galvanizing support for a national holiday is credited to Opal Lee, a retired African American teacher and activist known as \"the grandmother of Juneteenth.\" As a child, Lee witnessed a group of 500 white supremacists vandalize and burn her family's home to the ground.\n\nIn 2016, at the age 89, she began a walking campaign, traveling hundreds of kilometers from her hometown of Fort Worth, Texas, to Washington, D.C., to press for a Juneteenth federal holiday.\n\nHer efforts became a reality in 2021, when President Joe Biden signed legislation passed by Congress marking Juneteenth as the 11th nationally recognized holiday.\n\nIn a proclamation recognizing this Juneteenth as \"a day of observance,\" President Biden said Juneteenth \"not only marks the end of America's original sin of slavery but also the beginning of the work at the heart and soul of our Nation: Making the promise of America real for every American.\"", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While relishing time away from work is to be enjoyed, it's important to appreciate the rich history and significance behind the holiday.\n\nJuneteenth celebrates freedom. It marks the anniversary of June 19, 1865, when Union troops informed slaves in Texas that they finally had been set free, under the Emancipation Proclamation that President Abraham Lincoln had signed more than two years earlier. The proclamation officially ended slavery in 10 southern, Confederate states, including Florida. Note that Florida still doesn't recognize Juneteenth as a state holiday but that shouldn't diminish its significance.\n\nWhy Juneteenth is important: 'Our Independence Day': Boynton festivities celebrate Juneteenth holiday\n\nThe holiday deserves recognition. Florida apparently thought so, long before June 17, 2021, when President Joe Biden signed legislation making what was a popular commemoration into a federal holiday. Florida was one of the first states outside of Texas to recognize Juneteenth in 1991 as a day of observance. Later efforts to make the observance a state holiday were blocked in part due to the state's own version of Juneteenth -- Florida Emancipation Day, recalling a similar event when a Union general read the Emancipation Proclamation in Tallahassee.\n\nIn a state now known for its disdain rather than appreciation of American history, it would behoove Floridians to cherish and celebrate what many Americans have come to understand as \"America's Second Independence Day.\"\n\nFlorida has its own version of 'Juneteenth'\n\nTruth is, Juneteenth has been part and parcel of American history for some time now. The Emancipation Proclamation was signed in 1863 but making it a reality in the old Confederacy took time. The news didn't get to Texas until 2,000 Union troops arrived in Galveston two months after the Civil War's end to announce that the more than 200,000 slaves in the state had been freed by executive decree.\n\nIn Florida, that announcement of freedom occurred in Tallahassee on May 20, 1865. For the estimated 60,000 slaves in the state, the arrival of Major Gen. Edward McCook and the news of emancipation couldn't come soon enough. The annual celebrations that followed throughout Florida's Black communities came in the form of parades, picnics, seminars and community events. Florida's \"Juneteenth\" may now be overshadowed by the federal holiday. However, Florida Emancipation Day remains a part of Florida history and shouldn't be forgotten.\n\nIt's clear that Juneteenth provides an opportunity for all Floridians to learn more about their state and nation following the Civil War. Unfortunately, there's no specific mention of Florida Emancipation Day or Juneteenth in the Florida Sunshine State Standards, which is the basic curriculum for all public schools in the state. It's not a part of the AP United States History course, the nation's most advanced history course for high school students.\n\nSuch a fix is necessary but unlikely anytime soon, given the so-called 'Free State of Florida's' misplaced notion it must protect public school students from the hard truths of American history. The state's Stop Woke Act bans school instruction and employment training that suggests that a person is either oppressed or privileged because of their race, sex or national origin. A federal lawsuit has resulted in a preliminary injunction against the law as an appellate panel figures out its constitutionality.\n\nThe reality remains that many Black residents in Florida and much of the United States see the traditional Fourth of July Independence Day holiday through a different lens. For 246 years, slavery was both accepted custom and law of the land, until a brutal war between the states ended with both the Emancipation Proclamation and the passage of the 13th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Still, a stronger measure of freedom wouldn't come for another 100 years, thanks to legal racial segregation in Jim Crow laws and Black codes.\n\nIt's almost too easy to forget that our state and nation's great strength is its diversity. The varied backgrounds, cultures and histories of our residents are building blocks for a far better society than one undermined by narrow minds and misinformation. Juneteenth reminds us of the agonies of slavery, of the gains that have been made, and of the work that remains to be done.

It became a U.S. federal holiday in 2021, following the signing of a bill by President Joe Biden.\n\nLong a regional holiday in the South, Juneteenth rose in prominence across the country following 2020 protests over the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and other African Americans.\n\nJuneteenth, a combination of the words June and 19th, is also known as Emancipation Day. It commemorates the day in 1865 -- after the Confederate states surrendered to end the Civil War -- when a Union general arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform a group of enslaved African Americans of their freedom under President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nTexas officially declared Juneteenth a holiday in 1980. At least 28 states and the District of Columbia now legally recognize Juneteenth as state holidays and give state workers a paid day off.\n\nAlthough in part a celebration, the day is also observed solemnly to honor those who suffered as a result of slavery in the 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colonies that would eventually become the United States.\n\nNow in its fourth year as a federal holiday, all U.S. government employees and any private business that participates have the day off from work.\n\nNot all state governments recognize the holiday, however, meaning state employees in those states are expected to work. To enshrine Juneteenth in any state, its legislature would have to pass bills to make it a permanent holiday.\n\nIn 2023, four states -- Connecticut, Minnesota, Nevada and Tennessee -- designated Juneteenth as a permanent public holiday for the first time, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nAlabama Governor Kay Ivey authorized Juneteenth this year to be a state holiday by decree, after efforts by state lawmakers to pass legislation to make it a permanent state holiday.\n\nRace remains a sensitive issue in the United States, four years after tensions flared over the killing of George Floyd and other Black Americans at the hands of police. Floyd's killing sparked a global protest movement that led to calls for sweeping criminal justice reform and attention to other racial inequities.\n\nIn Florida and other states, some conservatives are trying to change the way Black history is taught in public schools, another sign of the deep tensions that still surround race in the United States, which imposed a draconian system of racial segregation on Black Americans following emancipation.\n\nSince Juneteenth 2023, the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer consider race as a factor in deciding on student admissions.\n\nThe decision ended affirmative action programs that have been used by many U.S. schools to increase their numbers of Black, Hispanic and other students from underrepresented communities.\n\nAmericans are marking the 159th anniversary of emancipation with festive meals, music and gatherings. Traditionally, celebrations have included parades and marches, many of which were held on Sunday.\n\nPeople are also celebrating the holiday by organizing for civil rights, reading books about African American heritage and history, attending festivals and musical performances, and dining at Black-owned restaurants.\n\nMeanwhile, other events will strike a more somber tone, with organizers using the day to draw attention to today's racial inequities they say stem from the legacy of slavery and structural racism.", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"},

Gen. Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3 in Galveston, Texas, proclaiming that enslaved African Americans were free. This was more than two years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nMany African Americans have commemorated Juneteenth with parties, parades and gatherings. The Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 moved Juneteenth to the forefront of national consciousness, and at least 28 states and Washington DC -- along with the federal government -- recognize Juneteenth as a public holiday.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nCar struck by train Saturday in Davenport after driving around crossing gate Water main break closes intersection in Village of East Davenport until next week Apartment building in Davenport given order to vacate Kobe Sushi and Hibachi opens in Davenport YMCA of the Iowa Mississippi Valley reacts to possible loss of North Family building Deere & Co. to pay $1.1 million in back wages, interest to Black and Hispanic applicants IN MEMORY: Steve Tappa, 1966-2024 Davenport man arrested for allegedly possessing child porn Angel Reese says Caitlin Clark gets 'special whistle.'

Others use it as a day of public service to volunteer in the community or advocate for issues affecting the Black American community. This year, Juneteenth falls on Wednesday, June 19. Here's what's open and closed on Juneteenth 2024.\n\nPostal services\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday for the United States Postal Service, so it will not deliver mail.\n\nHowever, all UPS and FedEx services will be open and available.\n\nFinancial services\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMarkets will be closed, and Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange will not be trading on Wednesday.\n\nJuneteenth is also a banking holiday observed by the Federal Reserve. Major banks like Chase and Bank of America will be closed in observance of the holiday. TD Bank, which has remained open in previous years, will also be closed Wednesday.\n\nAs always, online banking services and ATMs will be available for use.\n\nSchools and government agencies\n\nFederal offices will be closed on Juneteenth. Many schools will already be off for summer break.\n\nHowever, whether government or state employees in different places get a paid day off varies. In 2023, at least 28 states recognized Juneteenth as a public holiday for which state workers received a paid day off, according to a Pew Research analysis. Other states may hold a day of observance or other commemorations.\n\nRetailers\n\nMost major retailers and grocery stores will be open on Juneteenth. Walmart and Target, for example, will be open during normal hours. It's best to check if your local businesses and restaurants are also operating during normal hours for the holiday.\n\nCNN's Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report.\n\n6 books that explain the history and meaning of Juneteenth\n\n6 books that explain the history and meaning of Juneteenth\n\n6 books that explain the history and meaning of Juneteenth\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It marks the end of official slavery in the country and celebrates the promise of freedom.\n\nThe word \"Juneteenth\" combines the month \"June\" with the number 19. It recalls June 19, 1865, the day troops from the Union side of the American Civil War arrived in the city of Galveston, Texas.\n\nAt that time, Texas was part of the Confederate States of America, the group of Southern states fighting the Union for the right to keep slaves. The 250,000 enslaved people in Texas did not know that the president at the time -- Abraham Lincoln -- had declared them legally free.\n\nIn fact, Lincoln had declared them legally free more than two years earlier - on January 1, 1863.\n\nBut Texas was in the far west of the country and removed from much of the fighting. Few Union soldiers were there to communicate or enforce Lincoln's order. Confederate slaveholders did not agree with it. They did not want to lose the labor they got for free.\n\nSo, no one told the enslaved people -- until June 19, when a Union general and a few thousand soldiers arrived to take control of the area. The general quickly read an announcement. He informed the people that the Union had won the Civil War and that \"all slaves are free.\"\n\nMany formerly enslaved people immediately began to celebrate. As soon as they could, some left Texas and joined family members in other states. Some remained and built new lives.\n\nThey remembered June 19 in the years that followed. In time, their children and grandchildren celebrated it as a holiday, too.\n\nWhat happens on Juneteenth?\n\nHistorically, Juneteenth has involved cooking and eating outdoors, listening to music, saying prayers and wearing nice clothes.\n\nBetty Anderson, who is a descendant of enslaved people, spoke to The Federalist magazine about her Juneteenth traditions. She said the day includes stories about people who continued to fight for equal rights because \"freedom from slavery did not bring freedom for the African-American.\"\n\nHistorian Henry Louis Gates Jr. made a similar point in the online magazine The Root. He said one of the important things about Juneteenth is that it is a positive, powerful celebration, even in the face of discrimination.\n\nFor example, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, Texas officials refused to permit black people to gather in public spaces. So, black families and friends celebrated Juneteenth near rivers and lakes, Gates said. In time, they bought their own parks where they could celebrate.\n\nBecoming a national holiday\n\nDuring the country's Civil Rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, some Black Americans and activists embraced Juneteenth as a way to connect them to Black history.\n\nTexas became the first state to declare the day an official state holiday in 1980.\n\nIn June 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden declared Juneteenth as the country's newest national holiday. Biden said it was a day to \"remember the moral stain and terrible toll of slavery on our country.\" He added, \"But it is a day that also reminds us of our incredible capacity to heal, hope, and

Gen. Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3 in Galveston, Texas, proclaiming that enslaved African Americans were free. This was more than two years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nMany African Americans have commemorated Juneteenth with parties, parades and gatherings.

Many schools will already be off for summer break.\n\nHowever, whether government or state employees in different places get a paid day off varies.

Other states may hold a day of observance or other commemorations.\n\nRetailers\n\nMost major retailers and grocery stores will be open on Juneteenth.

The observance of Juneteenth, on the other hand, celebrates the freedom of each and every individual American.

These values are not exclusive to any one group but are intended to be universal.\n\nBy observing Juneteenth, we reaffirm our commitment to these principles and acknowledge where we have fallen short. This reflection is crucial for fostering a more inclusive society where every individual is free not merely from iron shackles, but also from the more abstract shackles that a nation may impose on its people.\n\nRecognizing Juneteenth on a national scale provides an opportunity to educate ourselves about a significant period in U.S. history that has often been distorted or inadequately covered in traditional curricula.\n\nUnderstanding the full scope of American history - including its darker chapters - ensures a more comprehensive national identity that empowers us to build a future informed by the lessons of the past.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

It sends the message that we are one America that values freedom for all, and that while much progress has been made since 1865, racial disparities still plague us today and operate to curtail the freedoms of some.\n\nThe collective observance of Juneteenth encourages dialogue about racial justice - conversations that are essential for meaningful societal change.\n\nEmbrace Juneteenth: Should conservatives celebrate Juneteenth? Federal holiday honors a victory for America.\n\nIn practical terms, national recognition of Juneteenth offers an occasion for public events that promote cultural exchange, mutual respect and understanding.

When communities come together to mark this day, it sends a powerful message that the fight against racism is a collective effort of all Americans. It reinforces the idea that racial justice is integral to the maintenance of our democracy.\n\nCelebrating Juneteenth is not a rejection of the Fourth of July.

It's a time of reflection, commemoration", "body": "Jacksonians talk about the meaning and importance of Juneteenth at the Two Mississippi Museums.\n\nAs Juneteenth approaches, Jackson is ready to party -- especially at The Two Mississippi Museums, where admission will be free for the whole day. For Jackson, which is more than 82% Black, the day will hold special significance as one of commemoration and celebration\n\nThe museums will feature \"Juneteenth Jubilee\" events from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. including live performances, a line dance workshop, crafts, and themed tours of the museums topped off with Fratelli Italian Ice.\n\n\"One of our responsibilities here is to talk about Juneteenth and all this complexity,\" Michael Morris, director of the Two Mississippi Museums said.\n\nJuneteenth closings: Are banks, post offices, UPS and FedEx open on Juneteenth 2024?\n\nMore on Juneteenth in Jackson: Fun Juneteenth events set for Jackson. See what's going on here\n\nJuneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas to tell enslaved people that the war was over and they were emancipated, over two months after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered. Though originally celebrated in Texas, the holiday spread around the United States as an emancipation celebration.\n\nWhat does Juneteenth mean?\n\nTwo years ago, President Biden signed The Juneteenth National Independence Act, making June 19th an official federal holiday. At least 28 states and D.C. celebrate Juneteenth as a state holiday, giving state employees a paid day off. Mississippi does not recognize Juneteenth, despite having one of the nation's largest Black populations and the largest population of freed slaves in 1865 when the 13th amendment was ratified.\n\nHezekiah Watkins, once a freedom rider in Jackson starting at just 13 years old, is now a docent at The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. He was jailed more than 100 times during the movement and his mugshot is displayed alongside other young freedom riders on a wall in the museum.\n\n\"[Juneteenth] means a lot to me. It means a day of celebration,\" he said. \"It means a day of recalling some of the things that went on back in the day.\"\n\nWatkins said he thinks Juneteenth should be an official state holiday. This Juneteenth, he hopes visitors will come out to the museum, pouring in not just from Jackson, but also from the rest of Mississippi.\n\n\"This museum, it's in Mississippi, and the stories that are told, in my opinion, because I lived it, are actual stories that happened,\" he said. \"I would love to see Mississippi come down here and get the actual truth of what went on back during that time.\"\n\nJust a little shy of two months before Juneteenth, Mississippi had another state holiday: Confederate Memorial Day. Unlike Juneteenth in the state, Confederate Memorial Day, on April 29, was a paid day off for state employees.\n\nMore on Confederate Memorial Day in MS: Mississippi one of only four states that still celebrates Confederate Memorial Day. Why?\n\nMarilyn Reed, a regular at The Two Mississippi Museums, visited the museum for a speaker event on civil rights markers. She plans to bring her 10-year-old niece to the museum on Juneteenth to celebrate.\n\nThis time last year, Reed's Juneteenth looked a little different. Then a state employee, Reed said she chose to take a personal day for Juneteenth.\n\n\"I felt like, as a Black woman, how could I be off for Confederate Memorial Day and work on Juneteenth?\" she said, adding that the only way for the state to change moving forward is for people to register to vote, show up to the polls and talk to their elected officials.\n\n\"At the core of Juneteenth is freedom, honoring the ancestors, and taking their vision and making it your own and expanding it and moving it forward,\" Reed said.\n\nJohn Spann, Mississippi Humanities Council Program and Outreach Officer, spoke at the event on new historic markers for The Mississippi Freedom Trail that Reed attended. For Spann, Juneteenth is also about legacy and forging a connection between the past and present.\n\n\"The reason why we even have a federal holiday is because people have been doing that memory work around explaining what Juneteenth is and putting in the work,\" he said.\n\nThis year, with the anniversary of Mississippi Freedom Summer, when thousands of student volunteers came to the state to register people to vote, Spann says the legacy of Juneteenth is even more obvious as it draws a clear line to the Civil Rights Movement. For Jackson, the two are interconnected as the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement remembers the country's first step forward.\n\n\"The fact that there's so many events happening really does demonstrate how important this event is to the African American community at large, but specifically here in the city of Jackson,\" Morris said. \"We're excited to just be a part of all of the celebrations that are going on.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.clarionledger.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Clarion-Ledger"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Confederate Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

It honors freedom for all.", "body": "Here's why this once local celebration is significant to U.S. history.\n\nJuneteenth, a federal holiday on June 19 commemorating the emancipation of enslaved Black people, represents far more than a milestone in Black history -- it is a pivotal moment in American history as a whole. Yet, when I asked some of my white family members and friends what they were doing for Juneteenth, their reply surprised me: \"We're just celebrating Fourth of July.\"\n\nThe Fourth of July celebrates our nation's independence from Great Britain and our nation's existence as an independent sovereign nation. The observance of Juneteenth, on the other hand, celebrates the freedom of each and every individual American. Consequently, Juneteenth should not be celebrated by the Black community alone; it demands the participation and reflection of all Americans.\n\nEmbracing Juneteenth universally underscores our collective responsibility to acknowledge and learn from the historical injustices that have shaped our present society.\n\nJames Causey: Blacks shouldn't have to lose identity to promote Juneteenth events\n\nJuneteenth commemorates the day in 1865 when Union Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, and announced the end of slavery, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. This delay in freedom for many enslaved people highlights the complexity and uneven enforcement of law and liberty, themes that resonate deeply within the broader American narrative. Celebrating Juneteenth nationwide allows all Americans to reflect on these themes and recognize that freedom is a journey toward equality that is ongoing and shared by all Americans.\n\nRecognizing Juneteenth on a national scale provides an opportunity to educate ourselves about a significant period in U.S. history that has often been distorted or inadequately covered in traditional curricula. Understanding the full scope of American history -- including its darker chapters -- ensures a more comprehensive national identity that empowers us to build a future informed by the lessons of the past.\n\nMoreover, celebrating Juneteenth as a unified nation can foster greater empathy and solidarity across diverse communities. It sends the message that we are one America that values freedom for all, and that while much progress has been made since 1865, racial disparities still plague us today and operate to curtail the freedoms of some. The collective observance of Juneteenth encourages dialogue about racial justice -- conversations that are essential for meaningful societal change.\n\nJames Causey: Walmart scooped up more than it bargained for with its Juneteenth ice cream failure\n\nIn practical terms, national recognition of Juneteenth offers an occasion for public events that promote cultural exchange, mutual respect and understanding. Festivals, educational programs and community gatherings can bring together individuals from different backgrounds to celebrate the full integration of Black citizens into our democracy. Such events can break down barriers and build bridges between communities. When communities come together to mark this day, it sends a powerful message that the fight against racism is a collective effort of all Americans. It reinforces the idea that racial justice is integral to the maintenance of our democracy.\n\nCelebrating Juneteenth is not a rejection of the Fourth of July. Nor should Juneteenth be seen as a \"Black Holiday.\" By honoring this day collectively, we as Americans acknowledge our shared history and commit to building a future rooted in a freedom that incorporates equality and justice for all. Let's celebrate!\n\nCarla D. Pratt is the Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher Chair in Civil Rights, Race and Justice at the College of Law at the University of Oklahoma.

It was the day 2,000 Union Army troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas with the news that the more than 250,000 enslaved Black people in the state were free by executive decree; more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nKnown as Juneteenth, Freedom Day, and in some regions 'Our Independence Day', we gathered several families together as the kids read their presentations about the holiday's significance and people like teacher and activist, Opal Lee, often referred to as \"grandmother of Juneteenth\" who fought to have the day federally recognized. Some parents confessed that it was a learning experience for them, too, as they had never been taught about Juneteenth in school. It's a travesty that we are still experiencing today.\n\nIn the last few years, several states have attempted to make it more difficult for students to learn about the origins of race and racism in this country by passing anti-Critical Race Theory (CRT) laws designed to prevent white students from feeling guilt about the ugly parts of American history.

Black communities nationwide now celebrate Juneteenth in various ways -- from cookouts, picnics, and rodeos to street fairs, family reunions, Miss Juneteenth pageants, blues festivals, historical reenactments, and quiet remembrances. It is also an occasion to support Black causes and Black-owned businesses. Our gatherings include buffets of foods like hibiscus, okra, and collard greens that originated in Africa, and red-hued foods like watermelon, strawberries, hibiscus tea, strawberry soda, and red velvet cake which is traditional during the celebration and represents resilience, joy, and the blood that was shed.\n\nMy son is now 17, a rising high school senior, and co-President of his school's Black Student Union. It fills my husband and me with pride to see his growth, knowledge of self, and understanding of the struggles and sacrifices our ancestors endured in America in order for him to enjoy the life he has today. This year, over food, music, and laughs, we will celebrate with family and friends, and pray for those who have gone on before us.\n\nIf you would like to host your own Juneteenth celebration, here are some ways to make it memorable.\n\nThe Menu: Traditional summer fare like barbecue, deviled eggs, potato salad, and baked beans, as well as red-hued foods like strawberries, watermelon, and red velvet cake.

The Juneteenth commemoration dates back to the last days of the Civil War, when Union soldiers landed in Galveston, Texas -- it was June 19th, 1865 -- with news that the war had ended, and enslaved people learned they were freed. It was two-and-a-half years after President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nIn 2021, President Biden signed legislation to make Juneteenth the first new federal holiday since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The day after Biden signed the legislation, I spoke to the writer and poet Clint Smith, author of How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning with the History of Slavery Across America. I began by asking him about traveling to Galveston, Texas, and his feelings on Juneeteenth becoming a federal holiday.\n\nCLINT SMITH: As you mentioned, I went to Galveston, Texas. I've been writing this book for four years, and I went two years ago. And it was marking the 40th anniversary of when Texas had made Juneteenth a state holiday. And it was the Al Edwards Prayer Breakfast. The late Al Edwards Sr. is the state legislator, Black state legislator, who made possible and advocated for the legislation that turned Juneteenth into a holiday, a state holiday in Texas.\n\nAnd so I went, in part, because I wanted to spend time with people who were the actual descendants of those who had been freed by General Gordon Granger's General Order No. 3. And it was a really remarkable moment, because I was in this place, on this island, on this land, with people for whom Juneteenth was not an abstraction. It was not a performance. It was not merely a symbol. It was part of their tradition. It was part of their lineage. It was an heirloom that had been passed down, that had made their lives possible. And so, I think I gained a more intimate sense of what that holiday meant.\n\nAnd to sort of broaden, broaden out more generally, you spoke to how it was more than two-and-a-half years after the Emancipation Proclamation, and it was an additional two months after General Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox, effectively ending the Civil War. So it wasn't only two years after the Emancipation Proclamation; it was an additional two months after the Civil War was effectively over.\n\nAnd so, for me, when I think of Juneteenth, part of what I think about is the both/andedness of it, that it is this moment in which we mourn the fact that freedom was kept from hundreds of thousands of enslaved people for years and for months after it had been attained by them, and then, at the same time, celebrating the end of one of the most egregious things that this country has ever done.\n\nAnd I think what we're experiencing right now is a sort of marathon of cognitive dissonance, in the way that is reflective of the Black experience as a whole, because we are in a moment where we have the first new federal holiday in over 40 years and a moment that is important to celebrate, the Juneteenth, and to celebrate the end of slavery and to have it recognized as a national holiday, and at the same time that that is happening, we have a state-sanctioned effort across state legislatures across the country that is attempting to prevent teachers from teaching the very thing that helps young people understand the context from which Juneteenth emerges.\n\nAnd so, I think that we recognize that, as a symbol, Juneteenth is not -- that it matters, that it is important, but it is clearly not enough. And I think the fact that Juneteenth has happened is reflective of a shift in our public consciousness, but also of the work that Black Texans and Black people across this country have done for decades to make this moment possible.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And can you explain more what happened in Galveston in 1865 and, even as you point out, what the Emancipation Proclamation actually did two-and-a-half years before?\n\nCLINT SMITH: Right. So, the Emancipation Proclamation is often a widely misunderstood document. So, it did not, sort of wholesale, free the enslaved people throughout the Union. It did not free enslaved people in the Union. In fact, there were several border states that were part of the Union that continued to keep their enslaved laborers, states like Kentucky, states like Delaware, states like Missouri. And what it did was it was a military edict that was attempting to free enslaved people in Confederate territory. But the only way that that edict would be enforced is if Union soldiers went and took that territory.\n\nAnd so, part of what many enslavers realized -- and realized correctly -- was that Texas would be one of the last frontiers that Union soldiers would be able to come in and force the Emancipation Proclamation -- if they ever made it there in the first place, because this was two years prior to the end of the Civil War. And so, you had enslavers from Virginia and from North Carolina and from all of these states in the upper South who brought their enslaved laborers and relocated to Texas, in ways that increased the population of enslaved people in Texas by the tens of thousands.\n\nAnd so, when Gordon Granger comes to Texas, he is making clear and letting people know that the Emancipation Proclamation had been enacted, in ways that because of the topography of Texas and because of how spread out and rural and far apart from different ecosystems of information many people were, a lot of enslaved people didn't know that the Emancipation Proclamation had happened. And some didn't even know that General Lee had surrendered at Appomattox two months prior. And so, part of what this is doing is making clear to the 250,000 enslaved people in Texas that they had actually been granted freedom two-and-a-half years prior and that the war that this was all fought over had ended two months before.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: During the ceremony making Juneteenth a federal holiday, President Biden got down on his knee to greet Opal Lee, the 94-year-old activist known as the Grandmother of Juneteenth. This is Biden speaking about Lee.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: As a child growing up in Texas, she and her family would celebrate Juneteenth. On Juneteenth 1939, when she was 12 years old, a white mob torched her family home. But such hate never stopped her, any more than it stopped the vast majority of you I'm looking at from this podium. Over the course of decades, she has made it her mission to see that this day came. It was almost a singular mission. She has walked for miles and miles, literally and figuratively, to bring attention to Juneteenth, to make this day possible.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And this is Opal Lee speaking at Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nOPAL LEE: I don't want people to think Juneteenth is just one day. There is too much educational components. We have too much to do. I even advocate that we do Juneteenth, that we celebrate freedom from the 19th of June to the Fourth of July, because we weren't free on the Fourth of July, 1776. That would be celebrating freedom -- do you understand? -- if we were able to do that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And that is Opal Lee, considered the Grandmother of Juneteenth. And, Clint, one of the things you do in your book is you introduce us to grassroots activists. This doesn't come from the top; this comes from years of organizing, as you point out, in Galveston itself and with people like -- not that there's anyone like -- Opal Lee.\n\nCLINT SMITH: Yeah, no, absolutely. Part of what this book is doing, it is an attempt to uplift the stories of people who don't often get the attention that they deserve in how they shape the historical record. So, that means the public historians who work at these historical sites and plantations. That means the museum curators. That means the activists and the organizers, people like Take 'Em Down NOLA in New Orleans, who pushed the City Council and the mayor to make possible the fact that in 2017 these statues would come down, several Confederate statues in my hometown, in New Orleans.\n\nAnd part of -- when I think about someone like Miss Opal Lee, part of what I think about is our proximity to this period of history, right? Slavery existed for 250 years in this country, and it's only not existed for 150. And, you know, the way that I was taught about slavery, growing up, in elementary school, we were made to feel as if it was something that happened in the Jurassic age, that it was the flint stone, the dinosaurs and slavery, almost as if they all happened at the same time. But the woman who opened the National Museum of African American History and Culture alongside the Obama family in 2016 was the daughter of an enslaved person -- not the granddaughter or the great-granddaughter or the great-great-granddaughter. The daughter of an enslaved person is who opened this museum of the Smithsonian in 2016. And so, clearly, for so many people, there are people who are alive today who were raised by, who knew, who were in community with, who loved people who were born into intergenerational chattel bondage. And so, this history that we tell ourselves was a long time ago wasn't, in fact, that long ago at all.\n\nAnd part of what so many activists and grassroots public historians and organizers across this country recognize is that if we don't fully understand and account for this history, that actually wasn't that long ago, that in the scope of human history was only just yesterday, then we won't fully understand our contemporary landscape of inequality today. We won't understand how slavery shaped the political, economic and social infrastructure of this country. And when you have a more acute understanding of how slavery shaped the infrastructure of this country, then you're able to more effectively look around you and see how the reason one community looks one way and another community looks another way is not because of the people in those communities, but is because of what has been done to those communities, generation after generation after generation. And I think that that is central to the sort of public pedagogy that so many of these activists and organizers who have been attempting to make Juneteenth a holiday and bring attention to it as an entry point to think more wholly and honestly about the legacy of slavery have been doing.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: During an interview on CNN, Democratic Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called out the 14 Republican congressmembers -- all white men -- who voted against making Juneteenth a federal holiday.\n\nREP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: This is pretty consistent with, I think, the Republican base, and it's -- whether it's trying to fight against teaching basic history around racism and the role of racism in U.S. history to -- you know, there's a direct through line from that to denying Juneteenth, the day that is widely recognized and celebrated as a symbolic kind of day to represent the end of slavery in the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: If you could respond to that, Clint Smith, and also the fact that on the same day, yesterday, the Senate minority leader said they would not be supporting the For the People Act?\n\nCLINT SMITH: Absolutely. I think, very clearly, the critical race theory -- the idea of it is being used as a bogeyman, and it is being misrepresented and distorted by people who don't even know what critical race theory is, right? So we should be clear that the thing that people are calling critical race theory is just -- that is the language that they are using to talk about the idea of teaching any sort of history that rejects the idea that America is a singularly exceptional place, and that we should not account for the history of harm that has been enacted to create opportunities and intergenerational wealth for millions of people, that has come at the direct expense of millions and millions of other people across generations.\n\nAnd so, part of what is happening in these state legislatures across the country with regard to the effort to push back against teaching of history -- 1619 Project, critical race theory and the like -- is a recognition that we have developed in this country a more sophisticated understanding, a more sophisticated framework, a more sophisticated public lexicon, with which to understand how slavery -- how racism was not just an interpersonal phenomenon, it was a historic one, it was a structural one, it was a systemic one.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I want you to talk more about your book, How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning with the History of Slavery Across America. Can you talk about the journey you took -- you were just mentioning where you grew up, in Louisiana, the map of the streets of Louisiana -- and why you feel it is so critical not only to look at the South, but your chapter on New York is something that people will be -- many will be shocked by, the level of -- when people talk about the South and slavery, that New York, of course, had enslaved people?\n\nCLINT SMITH: It did. It was really important for me to include a chapter on New York City, and a place in the North, more broadly, in part because, you know, while the majority of places I visit are in the South, because the South is where slavery was saturated and where it was most intimately tied the social and economic infrastructure of that society, it most certainly also existed in the North.\n\nWhat a lot of people don't know is that New York City, for an extended period of time, was the second-largest slave port in the country, after Charleston, South Carolina; that in 1860, on the brink of the Civil War, when South Carolina was about to secede from the Union after the election of Abraham Lincoln, that New York City's mayor, Fernando Wood, proposed that New York City should also secede from the Union alongside the Southern states, because New York's financial and political infrastructure were so deeply entangled and tied to the slavocracy of the South; also that the Statue of Liberty was originally conceived by \u00c9douard de Laboulaye, a French abolitionist, who conceived of the idea of the Statue of Liberty and giving it to the United States as a gift, that it was originally conceived as an idea to celebrate the end of the Civil War and to celebrate abolition.\n\nBut over time, that meaning has been -- even through the conception of the statue, right? The original conception of the statue actually had Lady Liberty breaking shackles, like a pair of broken shackles on her wrists, to symbolize the end of slavery. And over time, it became very clear that that would not have the sort of wide stream -- or, wide mainstream support of people across the country, obviously this having been just not too long after the end of the Civil War, so there were still a lot of fresh wounds. And so they shifted the meaning of the statue to be more about sort of inclusivity, more about the American experience, the American project, the American promise, the promise of democracy, and sort of obfuscated the original meaning, to the point where even the design changed. And so they replaced the shackles with a tablet and the torch, and then put the shackles very subtly sort of underneath her robe. And you can -- but the only way you can see them, these broken chains, these broken links, are from a helicopter or from an airplane.\n\nAnd in many ways, I think that that is a microcosm for how we hide the story of slavery across this country, that these chain links are hidden, out of sight, out of view of most people, under the robe of Lady Liberty, and how the story of slavery across this country is very -- as we see now, very intentionally trying to be hidden and kept from so many people, so that we have a fundamentally inconsistent understanding of the way that slavery shaped our contemporary society today.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Clint, before we end, you are an author, you're a writer, you're a teacher, and you are a poet. Can you share a poem with us?\n\nCLINT SMITH: I'd be happy to. And so, when you're a poet writing nonfiction, that very much animates the way that I approach the text. And so, this is part of the -- this is an adaptation or an except from the end of one of my chapters, that originally began as a poem that I wrote when I was trying to think about some of these issues that I brought up.\n\n[reading] Growing up, the iconography of the Confederacy was an ever-present fixture of my daily life. Every day on the way to school, I passed a statue of P.G.T. Beauregard riding on horseback, his Confederate uniform slung over his shoulder and his military cap pulled far down over his eyes. As a child, I did not know who P.G.T. Beauregard was. I did not know he was the man who ordered the first attack that opened the Civil War. I did not know he was one of the architects who designed the Confederate battle flag. I did not know he led an army predicated on maintaining the institution of slavery. What I knew is that he looked like so many of the other statues that ornamented the edges of this city, these copper garlands of a past that saw truth as something that should be buried underground and silenced by the soil.\n\nAfter the war, the sons and daughters of the Confederacy reshaped the contours of treason into something they could name as honorable. We called it the Lost Cause. And it crept its way into textbooks that attempted to cover up a crime that was still unfolding; that told us that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man, guilty of nothing but fighting for the state and the people that he loved; that the Southern flag was about heritage and remembering those slain fighting to preserve their way of life. But, see, the thing about the Lost Cause is that it's only lost if you're not actually looking. The thing about heritage is that it's a word that also means \"I'm ignoring what we did to you.\"\n\nI was taught the Civil War wasn't about slavery, but I was never taught how the declarations of Confederate secession had the promise of human bondage carved into its stone. I was taught the war was about economics, but I was never taught that in 1860 the 4 million enslaved Black people were worth more than every bank, factory and railroad combined. I was taught that the Civil War was about states' rights, but I was never taught how the Fugitive Slave Act could care less about a border and spelled Georgia and Massachusetts the exact same way.\n\nIt's easy to look at a flag and call it heritage when you don't see the Black bodies buried behind it. It's easy to look at a statue and call it history when you ignore the laws written in its wake.\n\nI come from a city abounding with statues of white men on pedestals and Black children playing beneath them, where we played trumpets and trombones to drown out the Dixie song that's still whistled in the wind. In New Orleans, there are over 100 schools, roads and buildings named for Confederates and slaveholders. Every day, Black children walk into buildings named after people who never wanted them to be there. Every time I would return home, I would drive on streets named for those who would have wanted me in chains.\n\nGo straight for two miles on Robert E. Lee, take a left on Jefferson Davis, make the first right on Claiborne. Translation: Go straight for two miles on the general who slaughtered hundreds of Black soldiers who were trying to surrender, take a left on the president of the Confederacy who made the torture of Black bodies the cornerstone of his new nation, make the first right on the man who permitted the heads of rebelling slaves to be put on stakes and spread across the city in order to prevent the others from getting any ideas.\n\nWhat name is there for this sort of violence? What do you call it when the road you walk on is named for those who imagined you under a noose? What do you call it when the roof over your head is named after people who would have wanted the bricks to crush you?\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Clint Smith, author of the book How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning with the History of Slavery Across America, speaking on Democracy Now! in 2021, the day after Juneteenth became a federal holiday.\n\nComing up, the pioneering musical artist Rhiannon Giddens.

This historic event marked the first new federal holiday since the adoption of Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983. Juneteenth commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans, specifically on June 19, 1865, when Major General Gordon Granger issued an order proclaiming freedom for slaves in Texas. Initially, Juneteenth was recognized only by certain communities, but it has since grown to become one of the most significant dates for Black Americans.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, on September 22, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, a presidential proclamation and executive order that declared enslaved African Americans in Confederate states to be freed. The final Proclamation was issued on January 1, 1863. It stated: \"I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States [in rebellion against the U.S.], and parts of States, are, and henceforward shall be free...\" The proclamation affected South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, and North Carolina.\n\nThe Proclamation declared that the executive branch, including the Army and Navy, \"will recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons.\" It applied to more than 3.5 million enslaved people in the country. Approximately 25,000 to 75,000 individuals were immediately emancipated in regions of the Confederacy where the U.S. Army was present.\n\nHowever, the enforcement of the Proclamation was not immediate everywhere. Texas, the most remote state of the former Confederacy, had 250,000 slaves. Many planters and slaveholders had migrated to Texas to avoid the war and had brought their slaves with them. News of the Proclamation reached Texas after its issuance, and while many slaves knew about Lincoln's order emancipating them, they were not freed since the Union army had not yet reached Texas to enforce the Proclamation.\n\nOn April 9, 1865, Confederate General-in-Chief Robert E. Lee surrendered, followed by the surrender of the western Confederate Army of the Trans-Mississippi on June 2. On June 19, 1865, Union Major General Gordon Granger arrived at the island of Galveston to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation with General Order No. 3, which freed all remaining slaves. He also oversaw Reconstruction after the war, nullifying all laws passed within the state during the war by Confederate lawmakers.\n\nWhile it is widely believed that Granger or his troops proclaimed the ordinance by reading it aloud, historians suggest that copies of the Ordinance were more likely posted in public places, including the church attended by Black Americans. The Order read: \"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.\"\n\nThe event has come to be celebrated as the end of slavery. However, emancipation for the remaining enslaved individuals in the Union border states of Delaware and Kentucky did not occur until December 18, 1865, with the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude.\n\nIn Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1866, one year after General Granger's arrival, the first annual commemoration known as \"Jubilee Day\" was organized. Other observances took place on January 1 (the day the Emancipation Declaration was issued) or January 4. Some of these early celebrations served as political rallies to provide freed African Americans with instructions for voting.\n\nIn 1867, Black leaders in Austin, Texas, raised funds to purchase 10 acres of land, now known as Houston's Emancipation Park, to celebrate the holiday. In subsequent years, the event drew thousands of attendees.\n\nDuring the early 1890s, the Black community began using the word Juneteenth instead of Jubilee Day. The word derives its name from combining June and nineteenth. One of the earliest records of its use dates back to 1909 when The Current Issue, a Texas periodical, employed the term.\n\nAlthough most early celebrations occurred in Texas, Black Americans who had left the state continued to commemorate Juneteenth wherever they relocated. By the second half of the 20th century, most states had established Juneteenth celebrations. Texas was the first state to declare Juneteenth a state holiday in 1980. By the end of the century, only three states officially observed the day. Over the next two decades, it gained recognition as an official observance in all states, except South Dakota, until it became a federal holiday under the Biden administration.\n\nTexan Opal Lee and other Black Americans campaigned for decades to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday. Each year, Lee led 2.5-mile walks, symbolizing the 2.5 years it took for news of the Emancipation Proclamation to reach Texas (although the news had arrived, slaves weren't freed until the Union took control of the state). During the bill signing ceremony that designated Juneteenth as a federal holiday, she was an honored guest and President Joe Biden knelt down on one knee to greet her.\n\nThanks to the holiday, federal government employees now have the day off every year on June 19. If the date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, they have the closest Friday or Monday off, respectively.\n\nAmericans across the country celebrate Juneteenth over the weekend with festivals, parades, cookouts and gatherings of friends or family. This relatively new holiday has become more widely recognized in various communities. However, some states such as Florida are attempting to prevent certain aspects of the history of the end of slavery from being taught in public schools.\n\nIn Memphis, where Juneteenth will also be recognized as a state holiday, local residents and visitors are participating in a multi-day festival that includes food, music, cultural exhibits and more. To commemorate the holiday, the National Civil Rights Museum, the site where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, is offering free admission on Wednesday. For the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service will offer free admission to all parks during the holiday.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alonso_martinez@english.elpais.com", "name": "Alonso Mart\u00ednez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King Jr. Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Many people get the day off work or school, and there are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts, and other events.\n\nPeople who never gave the holiday on June 19 more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIS JUNETEENTH A SOLEMN DAY OF REMEMBRANCE OR MORE OF A PARTY?\n\nIt just depends on what you want.\n\nJuneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved families, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nAlan Freeman, 60, grew up celebrating Juneteenth every year in Houston, 50 miles north of Galveston. A comedian who has produced Galveston's first-ever Juneteenth Comedy Festival, Freeman says he has vivid memories of smoke permeating his entire neighborhood because so many people were using their barbecue pits for celebratory cookouts. You could go to anyone's house and be welcome to join in the feast, which could include grilled chicken and beef and other regional cuisines -- jerk meats, fried fish, Jamaican plantains.\n\n\"It's where I began to really see Black unity because I realized that that was the one day that African Americans considered ours,\" Freeman said. \"The one holiday that was ours. We didn't have to share with anybody. And it was about freedom because what we understood is that we were emancipated from slavery. But, there was so many beautiful activities.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nWHAT IF YOU'VE NEVER CELEBRATED JUNETEENTH?\n\nAnderson, 57, of Columbia, Maryland, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nAnderson has no special event planned other than giving his employees Friday and Monday off. If anything, Anderson is thinking about the fact it's Father's Day this weekend.\n\n\"If I can unite Father's Day and Juneteenth to be with my family and honor them, that would be wonderful,\" he said.\n\nARE THERE SPECIAL FOODS SERVED ON JUNETEENTH?\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nDOES HOW YOU CELEBRATE JUNETEENTH MATTER IF YOU AREN'T BLACK?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nIf you want to bring some authenticity to your recognition of Juneteenth, educate yourself. Attending a street festival or patronizing a Black-owned business is a good start but it also would be good to \"make your mind better,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"That goes longer than a celebration,\" Anderson said. \"I think Black people need to do it too because it's new for us as well, in America. But for non-Black people, if they could read on this topic and read on Black history beyond Martin Luther King and Rosa Parks, that would show me that you're really serious about growing in this area.\"\n\nIf you're struggling with how to \"ethically\" mark the day, Brown also suggested expanding your knowledge of why the holiday matters so much. That can be through reading, attending an event or going to an African American history museum if there's one nearby.\n\n\"Have that full human experience of seeing yourself in and through the eyes of others, even if that's not your own lived experience,\" she said. \"That is a radical human act that is awesome and should be encouraged and celebrated.\"\n\nWHAT ARE OTHER NAMES USED TO REFER TO JUNETEENTH?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIS THERE A PROPER JUNETEENTH GREETING?\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" said Freeman, the comedian.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other? You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody. This is the same way,\" Freeman said.\n\nNo matter what race you are, you will \"absolutely\" elicit a smile if you utter either greeting, he said.\n\n\"I believe that a non-Black person who celebrates Juneteenth ... it's their one time to have a voice, to participate.\"\n\n___\n\nTang, who reported from Phoenix, is a member of The Associated Press' Race and Ethnicity team.

Initially a regional holiday in the South, it gained national prominence following 2020 protests over racial injustices. The day is marked by celebrations and solemn observances, highlighting ongoing racial inequities.\n\nJuneteenth, a day that marks the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans, is always observed on June 19 each year. It became a U.S. federal holiday in 2021, following the signing of a bill by President Joe Biden. Long a regional holiday in the South, Juneteenth rose in prominence across the country following 2020 protests over the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and other African Americans.\n\nWHEN IS JUNETEENTH? Juneteenth, a combination of the words June and 19th, is also known as Emancipation Day. It commemorates the day in 1865 - after the Confederate states surrendered to end the Civil War - when a Union general arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform a group of enslaved African Americans of their freedom under President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nTexas officially declared Juneteenth a holiday in 1980. At least 28 states and the District of Columbia now legally recognize Juneteenth as state holidays and give state workers a paid day off. Although in part a celebration, the day is also observed solemnly to honor those who suffered as a result of slavery in the 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colonies that would eventually become the United States.\n\nWHAT IS SIGNIFICANT ABOUT JUNETEENTH THIS YEAR? Now in its fourth year as a federal holiday, all U.S. government employees and any private business that participates have the day off from work.\n\nNot all state governments recognize the holiday, however, meaning state employees in those states are expected to work. To enshrine Juneteenth in any state, its legislature would have to pass bills to make it a permanent holiday. In 2023, Connecticut, Minnesota, Nevada and Tennessee made Juneteenth a permanent public holiday for the first time, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nAlabama Governor Kay Ivey authorized Juneteenth this year to be a state holiday by decree, after efforts by state lawmakers to pass legislation to make it a permanent state holiday. Race remains a sensitive issue in the United States, four years after tensions flared over the killing of George Floyd and other Black Americans at the hands of police. Floyd's killing sparked a global protest movement that led to calls for sweeping criminal justice reform and attention to other racial inequities.\n\nIn Florida and other states, some conservatives are trying to change the way Black history is taught in public schools, another sign of the deep tensions that still surround race in the United States, which imposed a draconian system of racial segregation on Black Americans following emancipation. Since Juneteenth 2023, the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer consider race as a factor in deciding on student admissions. The decision ended affirmative action programs that have been used by many U.S. schools to increase their numbers of Black, Hispanic and other students from underrepresented communities.\n\nHOW ARE PEOPLE MARKING JUNETEENTH? Americans are marking the 159th anniversary of emancipation with festive meals, music and gatherings. Traditionally, celebrations have included parades and marches, many of which were held on Sunday.\n\nPeople are also celebrating the holiday by organizing for civil rights, reading books about African American heritage and history, attending festivals and musical performances, and dining at Black-owned restaurants. Meanwhile, other events will strike a more somber tone, with organizers using the day to draw attention to today's racial inequities they say stem from the legacy of slavery and structural racism.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

Yet the holiday, born out of bipartisanship, is becoming more divisive each year.\n\nThe Left has coopted Juneteenth to push for radical racial policies such as reparations and exclude most Americans from its celebration. As a result, many conservatives now oppose the federal holiday.\n\nBut in the eyes of this Texas historian, it's a mistake to abandon a unifying national holiday to the manipulations of the Left. We should instead do what conservatives are best at: Get back to the roots.\n\nUntil the past four years, Juneteenth was an uncontroversial celebration of American freedom and the end of slavery in Texas. The holiday commemorates the day Union Gen. Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3 in Galveston, informing Texas of the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing the state's slaves, and marking the end of slavery under the Confederacy.\n\nThe next year, in 1866, residents of Galveston began celebrating \"Jubilee Day,\" which eventually became what we know as Juneteenth. In 1979, Al Edwards, a Democratic state representative from Houston, sponsored legislation to make Juneteenth a paid state holiday. Texas Gov. Bill Clements, a Republican, signed the bill into law, and the holiday was born.\n\nThe national acceptance of Juneteenth also began in a bipartisan fashion. President Donald Trump was the first president to call for its adoption as a federal holiday in 2020, although it took a year for Congress to act. When it did, the bill passed the Senate with unanimous consent and 415-14 in the House.\n\nWith that kind of history, one would expect conservatives, even those wary of the pitfalls of identity politics like me, to embrace Juneteenth's consistency with the principles enshrined in our founding documents.\n\nThe holiday celebrates what President Abraham Lincoln called \"a new birth of freedom\" for America. It celebrates the completion of the work of July 4, 1776 -- the extension of liberty to all Americans. It also commemorates the untold numbers of young men who died in the war fighting for that freedom.\n\nIf it's good enough for Texas, why are some conservatives beginning to oppose the holiday?\n\nUnfortunately, the answer lies mostly on the left.\n\nThe Left has worked hard to coopt the holiday and use it as a tool to divide their countrymen and to replace the real Independence Day. It began on the first federal Juneteenth, when Democratic leaders tied the 156-year-old holiday to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Then, the Left named the national holiday \"Juneteenth National Independence Day,\" setting it up in opposition to July 4.\n\nWhat was once a broadly accepted state holiday celebrating a significant moment in Texas history became a pawn in the national game of identity politics and subject to the division of the 24-hour news cycle.\n\nThe Guardian published a story calling Juneteenth \"the real Independence Day\" -- a slap in the face to both our Founders and all Americans who celebrate July 4. Activists have called for Juneteenth to be used to explore \"racial trauma\" and enact reparations.\n\nUnder these circumstances, it is no surprise that Americans are souring on Juneteenth. What they hear from the media and elected leaders on Juneteenth is a self-righteous, anti-American drumbeat of criticism and division. Most Americans are excluded from the celebration, as is anyone who believes in America's founding or doesn't buy the narrative that America is \"systemically racist\" today.\n\nBut it's not too late to save the holiday from those who would abuse it. Here's one way: Celebrate it as the first day of a two-week national celebration of independence and freedom, stretching from June 19 to July 4.\n\nWe should remember the wars in which Americans fought and died to defend our shared heritage of liberty and expand it to all Americans. We should commemorate the armies of young patriots -- black and white -- who fought wars against tyrannical elites, whether it was the English crown or the plantation owner. We should consider how elites today are trying to take away the very freedoms that were secured on June 19 and July 4 through the blood of our forefathers and work with our neighbors to protect our liberties.\n\nThat's the true spirit of Juneteenth. It's a day of building up our country, not tearing it down. We have an opportunity to reject racial divisions and the revisionist history of the ivory tower.\n\nIt's long past time conservatives start reclaiming our institutions -- let's start this June

What is still open?", "body": "(NewsNation) -- This Wednesday is Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day, which marks the date when the last enslaved people in the United States learned they were free.\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed a bill to designate Juneteenth, which falls on June 19, as a federal holiday, and all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia recognize it as a holiday or observance. However, according to the Congressional Research Service, only 28 states have made it a permanent paid or legal holiday with legislation or executive action.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and its 24 bank branches are set to be closed on Wednesday for Juneteenth. Other banks, such as Capitol One, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo, Chase, and American National Bank will close as well.\n\nOn X, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts said federal courtrooms would be closed but e-filing is still available.\n\nIn addition, the U.S. Postal Service is closing for Juneteenth, and there will be no regular mail delivery, except holiday premium Priority Mail Express. People can still order stamps, shipping supplies, print shipping labels and request package pickups online.\n\nUPS and FedEx store locations are open, though, will pickup and delivery services available.\n\nPrivate employers are not required to give people paid time off on any holidays, management services company ADP writes, although some states have restrictions on making employees work on these days. They can choose to observe holidays as paid ones, and ADP notes that many employees have either done so for Juneteenth, or offered employees \"floating holidays.\"\n\nIt may have only been officially recognized as a federal holiday in the last few years, but Juneteenth has been celebrated by Black Americans, the National Museum of African American History and Culture said on its website.\n\n\"The historical legacy of Juneteenth shows the value of never giving up hope in uncertain times,\" the museum wrote.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation declared in 1863 that \"all persons held as slaves\" in states that were part of the Confederacy \"are, and henceforward shall be free.\" However, this was not enforced in many places until the end of the Civil War, and the Associated Press writes that white people who profited from unpaid labor were reluctant to share the news. In Texas, the History Channel wrote, slavery had continued as the state did not see large-scale fighting or a \"significant\" number of Union troops.\n\nWhen the Civil War ended in April 1865, U.S. General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, and read General Orders No. 3: \"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free.\" The History Channel notes emancipation still did not happen \"overnight\" when this happened, but newly freed people celebrated. Slavery would not be formally abolished until that December when the 13th amendment was ratified.\n\nThe next year, newly freed people in Texas organized \"Jubilee Day\" on June 19, 1866. Celebrations continued on this day for decades, and in 1979, Texas made Juneteenth an official holiday. Other states did as well, and then in June 2021, Biden made it a federal holiday after Congress passed a resolution.", "source": {"uri": "newsnationnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsNation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cassie_buchman@newsnationnow.com", "name": "Cassie Buchman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Postal Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewsNation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NewsNation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Office_of_the_United_States_Courts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Administrative Office of the United States Courts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Research Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._P._Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

On that day, some 250,000 still-enslaved African Americans were told that the Civil War had ended and that they had been declared free by law.\n\nThe day has been marked ever since in Galveston, Texas, where Union soldiers arrived to free the remaining slaves, and Texas made Juneteenth an official state holiday in 1980. Other parts of the U.S. also began marking the occasion, and just days before the 2021 celebration, on June 16, Congress made June 19 a federal holiday. President Joe Biden signed the holiday into law on June 17.\n\nBut Americans will have different experiences of the occasion depending on where they live and whether their bosses will give them the day off.\n\n\"I was proud to sign bipartisan legislation establishing Juneteenth as our newest Federal holiday, so that all Americans can feel the power of this day, learn from our history, celebrate our progress, and recognize and engage in the work that continues,\" Biden said, as he made the event official back in 2021.\n\nBut today, some states designate Juneteenth as a federal holiday, while in others it may simply be a day of observance.\n\nNationwide numbers are still being crunched for this year's event. In 2023, more than half of the U.S. states recognized Juneteenth as an official public holiday, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nSome 28 states and the District of Columbia made the date a public holiday, analysts revealed. State workers were given the day off with full pay and state government offices were closed in Alabama, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Min\n\nnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia.\n\nJust 19 states had no official provision for Juneteenth last year, the analysts said, meaning there was no federal holiday in Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Wisconsin and Wyoming.\n\nA further three states -- California, Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- had some level of official recognition, according to the Pew Research Centre. California allowed state employees to take Juneteenth off work in lieu of a personal holiday. While Pennsylvania allows certain employees to have the day off as an \"official annual observance.\" North Carolina views the event as a \"floating holiday\" that some employees will be given off.\n\nOther caveats can exist too. For example, in Illinois, state workers will only receive a paid holiday for Juneteenth if that date falls on a weekday.\n\nSome critics have been sceptical about the holiday, suggesting it does not signify real change in the U.S.\n\nOthers have criticized companies for trying to cash-in on the holiday.\n\nWalmart was slammed in 2022 when shoppers accused the retailer of trying to trademark the word \"Juneteenth\" with sales of themed merchandise. Journalist Chris Lovingood shared a photo of the store's \"Celebration Edition Juneteenth Ice Cream,\" which appeared to have a trademark logo by the word Juneteeth.\n\nAmericans are preparing to celebrate Juneteenth next Wednesday. An early celebration was held at the White House this week, although the event was overshadowed when Biden appeared to freeze as others danced around him.\n\nMeanwhile, the city of Hamilton in Ohio has canceled its planned event, with organizers blaming \"unforeseen complications.\" Newsweek reached out to the committee in charge seeking further information.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com",

History and celebration explained", "body": "June 18 (Reuters) - Juneteenth, a day that marks the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans, is always observed on June 19 each year. It became a U.S. federal holiday in 2021, following the signing of a bill by President Joe Biden.\n\nLong a regional holiday in the South, Juneteenth rose in prominence across the country following 2020 protests over the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and other African Americans.\n\nWHEN IS JUNETEENTH?\n\nJuneteenth, a combination of the words June and 19th, is also known as Emancipation Day. It commemorates the day in 1865 - after the Confederate states surrendered to end the Civil War - when a Union general arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform a group of enslaved African Americans of their freedom under President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nTexas officially declared Juneteenth a holiday in 1980. At least 28 states and the District of Columbia now legally recognize Juneteenth as state holidays and give state workers a paid day off.\n\nAlthough in part a celebration, the day is also observed solemnly to honor those who suffered as a result of slavery in the 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colonies that would eventually become the United States.\n\nWHAT IS SIGNIFICANT ABOUT JUNETEENTH THIS YEAR?\n\nNow in its fourth year as a federal holiday, all U.S. government employees and any private business that participates have the day off from work.\n\nNot all state governments recognize the holiday, however, meaning state employees in those states are expected to work. To enshrine Juneteenth in any state, its legislature would have to pass bills to make it a permanent holiday.\n\nIn 2023, Connecticut, Minnesota, Nevada and Tennessee made Juneteenth a permanent public holiday for the first time, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nAlabama Governor Kay Ivey authorized Juneteenth this year to be a state holiday by decree, after efforts by state lawmakers to pass legislation to make it a permanent state holiday.\n\nRace remains a sensitive issue in the United States, four years after tensions flared over the killing of George Floyd and other Black Americans at the hands of police. Floyd's killing sparked a global protest movement that led to calls for sweeping criminal justice reform and attention to other racial inequities.\n\nIn Florida and other states, some conservatives are trying to change the way Black history is taught in public schools, another sign of the deep tensions that still surround race in the United States, which imposed a draconian system of racial segregation on Black Americans following emancipation.\n\nSince Juneteenth 2023, the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer consider race as a factor in deciding on student admissions.\n\nThe decision ended affirmative action programs that have been used by many U.S. schools to increase their numbers of Black, Hispanic and other students from underrepresented communities.\n\nHOW ARE PEOPLE MARKING JUNETEENTH?\n\nAmericans are marking the 159th anniversary of emancipation with festive meals, music and gatherings. Traditionally, celebrations have included parades and marches, many of which were held on Sunday.\n\nPeople are also celebrating the holiday by organizing for civil rights, reading books about African American heritage and history, attending festivals and musical performances, and dining at Black-owned restaurants.\n\nMeanwhile, other events will strike a more somber tone, with organizers using the day to draw attention to today's racial inequities they say stem from the legacy of slavery and structural racism.\n\nReporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta; Editing by Kat Stafford and Aurora Ellis",

Gen. Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3 in Galveston, Texas, proclaiming that enslaved African Americans were free. This was more than two years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nMany African Americans have commemorated Juneteenth with parties, parades and gatherings. The Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 moved Juneteenth to the forefront of national consciousness, and at least 28 states and Washington DC -- along with the federal government -- recognize Juneteenth as a public holiday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Others use it as a day of public service to volunteer in the community or advocate for issues affecting the Black American community. This year, Juneteenth falls on Wednesday, June 19. Here's what's open and closed on Juneteenth 2024.\n\nPostal services\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday for the United States Postal Service, so it will not deliver mail.\n\nHowever, all UPS and FedEx services will be open and available.\n\nFinancial services\n\nMarkets will be closed, and Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange will not be trading on Wednesday.\n\nJuneteenth is also a banking holiday observed by the Federal Reserve. Major banks like Chase and Bank of America will be closed in observance of the holiday. TD Bank, which has remained open in previous years, will also be closed Wednesday.\n\nAs always, online banking services and ATMs will be available for use.\n\nSchools and government agencies\n\nFederal offices will be closed on Juneteenth. Many schools will already be off for summer break.\n\nHowever, whether government or state employees in different places get a paid day off varies. In 2023, at least 28 states recognized Juneteenth as a public holiday for which state workers received a paid day off, according to a Pew Research analysis. Other states may hold a day of observance or other commemorations.\n\nRetailers\n\nMost major retailers and grocery stores will be open on Juneteenth. Walmart and Target, for example, will be open during normal hours. It's best to check if your local businesses and restaurants are also operating during normal hours for the holiday.\n\nCNN's Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report.\n\n6 books that explain the history and meaning of Juneteenth Reading recommendations\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It became a U.S. federal holiday in 2021, following the signing of a bill by President Joe Biden.\n\nLong a regional holiday in the South, Juneteenth rose in prominence across the country following 2020 protests over the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks and other African Americans.\n\nWHEN IS JUNETEENTH?\n\nJuneteenth, a combination of the words June and 19th, is also known as Emancipation Day. It commemorates the day in 1865 - after the Confederate states surrendered to end the Civil War - when a Union general arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform a group of enslaved African Americans of their freedom under President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nTexas officially declared Juneteenth a holiday in 1980. At least 28 states and the District of Columbia now legally recognize Juneteenth as state holidays and give state workers a paid day off.\n\nAlthough in part a celebration, the day is also observed solemnly to honor those who suffered as a result of slavery in the 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colonies that would eventually become the United States.\n\nWHAT IS SIGNIFICANT ABOUT JUNETEENTH THIS YEAR?\n\nNow in its fourth year as a federal holiday, all U.S. government employees and any private business that participates have the day off from work.\n\nNot all state governments recognize the holiday, however, meaning state employees in those states are expected to work. To enshrine Juneteenth in any state, its legislature would have to pass bills to make it a permanent holiday.\n\nIn 2023, Connecticut, Minnesota, Nevada and Tennessee made Juneteenth a permanent public holiday for the first time, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nAlabama Governor Kay Ivey authorized Juneteenth this year to be a state holiday by decree, after efforts by state lawmakers to pass legislation to make it a permanent state holiday.\n\nRace remains a sensitive issue in the United States, four years after tensions flared over the killing of George Floyd and other Black Americans at the hands of police. Floyd's killing sparked a global protest movement that led to calls for sweeping criminal justice reform and attention to other racial inequities.\n\nIn Florida and other states, some conservatives are trying to change the way Black history is taught in public schools, another sign of the deep tensions that still surround race in the United States, which imposed a draconian system of racial segregation on Black Americans following emancipation.\n\nSince Juneteenth 2023, the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court ruled that universities can no longer consider race as a factor in deciding on student admissions.\n\nThe decision ended affirmative action programs that have been used by many U.S. schools to increase their numbers of Black, Hispanic and other students from underrepresented communities.\n\nHOW ARE PEOPLE MARKING JUNETEENTH?\n\nAmericans are marking the 159th anniversary of emancipation with festive meals, music and gatherings. Traditionally, celebrations have included parades and marches, many of which were held on Sunday.\n\nPeople are also celebrating the holiday by organizing for civil rights, reading books about African American heritage and history, attending festivals and musical performances, and dining at Black-owned restaurants.\n\nMeanwhile, other events will strike a more somber tone, with organizers using the day to draw attention to today's racial inequities they say stem from the legacy of slavery and structural racism.\n\n(Reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta; Editing by Kat Stafford and Aurora Ellis)",

It honors freedom for all.", "body": "Here's why this once local celebration is significant to U.S. history.\n\nJuneteenth, a federal holiday on June 19 commemorating the emancipation of enslaved Black people, represents far more than a milestone in Black history -- it is a pivotal moment in American history as a whole. Yet, when I asked some of my white family members and friends what they were doing for Juneteenth, their reply surprised me: \"We're just celebrating Fourth of July.\"\n\nThe Fourth of July celebrates our nation's independence from Great Britain and our nation's existence as an independent sovereign nation. The observance of Juneteenth, on the other hand, celebrates the freedom of each and every individual American. Consequently, Juneteenth should not be celebrated by the Black community alone; it demands the participation and reflection of all Americans.\n\nEmbracing Juneteenth universally underscores our collective responsibility to acknowledge and learn from the historical injustices that have shaped our present society.\n\nJuneteenth commemorates the day in 1865 when Union Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, and announced the end of slavery, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. This delay in freedom for many enslaved people highlights the complexity and uneven enforcement of law and liberty, themes that resonate deeply within the broader American narrative. Celebrating Juneteenth nationwide allows all Americans to reflect on these themes and recognize that freedom is a journey toward equality that is ongoing and shared by all Americans.\n\nRecognizing Juneteenth on a national scale provides an opportunity to educate ourselves about a significant period in U.S. history that has often been distorted or inadequately covered in traditional curricula. Understanding the full scope of American history -- including its darker chapters -- ensures a more comprehensive national identity that empowers us to build a future informed by the lessons of the past.\n\nMoreover, celebrating Juneteenth as a unified nation can foster greater empathy and solidarity across diverse communities. It sends the message that we are one America that values freedom for all, and that while much progress has been made since 1865, racial disparities still plague us today and operate to curtail the freedoms of some. The collective observance of Juneteenth encourages dialogue about racial justice -- conversations that are essential for meaningful societal change.\n\nIn practical terms, national recognition of Juneteenth offers an occasion for public events that promote cultural exchange, mutual respect and understanding. Festivals, educational programs and community gatherings can bring together individuals from different backgrounds to celebrate the full integration of Black citizens into our democracy. Such events can break down barriers and build bridges between communities. When communities come together to mark this day, it sends a powerful message that the fight against racism is a collective effort of all Americans. It reinforces the idea that racial justice is integral to the maintenance of our democracy.\n\nCelebrating Juneteenth is not a rejection of the Fourth of July. Nor should Juneteenth be seen as a \"Black Holiday.\" By honoring this day collectively, we as Americans acknowledge our shared history and commit to building a future rooted in a freedom that incorporates equality and justice for all. Let's celebrate!\n\nCarla D. Pratt is the Ada Lois Sipuel Fisher Chair in Civil Rights, Race and Justice at the College of Law at the University of Oklahoma.

It is a vast celebration of African-American life and culture\n\nAfter decades of being celebrated at mostly the local level, Juneteenth - the long-standing holiday that commemorates the arrival of news of emancipation and freedom to enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, in 1865 - became a federal holiday in 2021. In honor of this year's Juneteenth, The Conversation reached out to Wake Forest University humanities professor Corey D. B. Walker for a list of readings that can help people better understand the history and meaning of the observance. Below, Walker recommends six books.\n\nCombining history and memoir, Annette Gordon-Reed's \"On Juneteenth\" offers a moving history of African American life and culture through the prism of Juneteenth. The award-winning Harvard historian presents an intimate portrait of the experiences of her family and her memories of life as an African American girl growing up in segregated Texas. The essays in her book invite readers to enter a world shaped by the forces of freedom and slavery.\n\nReed's exploration of the history and legacy of Juneteenth is a poignant reminder of the hard history all Americans face.\n\nWilliam H. Wiggins Jr.'s \"O Freedom! Afro-American Emancipation Celebrations\" is the historical standard for African American emancipation celebrations. It offers an accessible and well-researched account of the emergence and evolution of Juneteenth.\n\nWiggins brings together oral history with archival research to share the stories of how African Americans celebrated emancipation. It explains how Juneteenth is part of the tapestry of emancipation celebrations. These celebrations included such dates as January 1, in North Carolina, April 3, in Richmond, Virginia, and April 16, in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat began as a local holiday has evolved into a national celebration.\n\nJuneteenth celebrations are known for the variety of programs and events that highlight African American history and culture. In the 1960s, students at Prairie View A&M University in Prairie View, Texas, informed faculty that classes would not be held on Juneteenth. In Milwaukee, the local Juneteenth parade includes a group known as the Black Cowboys riding their horses along Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. Juneteenth celebrations also feature cultural fairs and exhibitions, artistic performances and historical reenactments. Lectures and public conversations, community feasts and religious services are also part of the celebrations.\n\nRalph Ellison, perhaps best known for his novel \"Invisible Man,\" offers multiple meanings of Juneteenth in African American and American life in his posthumously published novel \"Juneteenth.\"\n\nThe ambivalence of Juneteenth is of a freedom delayed but not denied. Ellison's spiraling novel captures this in the entangled and tragic lives of the racist Senator Sunraider - previously known as Bliss - and the minister who raised him, the Reverend A. Z. Hickman. For Ellison, Juneteenth represents more than just a celebration of emancipation. It also represents the shared fate of white Americans and African Americans in the quest to create a just and equal society. The promise and peril of Juneteenth is elegantly captured in Hickman's words, \"There's been a heap of Juneteenths before this one and I tell you there'll be a heap more before we're truly free!\"\n\nMitch Kachun's book, \"Festivals of Freedom: Memory and Meaning in African American Emancipation Celebrations, 1808-1915,\" traces the history of emancipation celebrations and their influence on African American identity and community. Juneteenth joined a longer tradition of emancipation celebrations. Those celebrations included ones at the end of the trans-Atlantic slave trade in the United States on Jan. 1, 1808. They also included the August First Day/West India Day celebrations that marked the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire on Aug. 1, 1834.\n\nWith an eye for historical detail, Kachun narrates a complex history of how Juneteenth and other freedom festivals shaped African American identity and political culture. The celebrations also displayed competing meanings of African American identity. In Washington, D.C. in the late 19th century, different groups of African Americans held distinct celebrations. These variations underscored tensions around political ideals, status and identity. Kachun's book reminds us that Juneteenth served as a crucible for forging a collective and contested sense of African American community.\n\nSimilar to Kachun's book, Howard University historian Jeffrey R. Kerr-Ritchie's \"Rites of August First: Emancipation Day in the Black Atlantic World\" reminds readers of a broader history and geography of emancipation celebrations.\n\nKerr-Ritchie focuses on how various African American communities adopted and adapted West India Day celebrations. He also explores how they created meaning and culture in celebrating the abolition of slavery in the British West Indies. Kerr-Ritchie's book details how these celebrations moved across political borders and boundaries.\n\nContemporary invocations of Juneteenth often overlook its military history.\n\nEdward T. Cotham, Jr.'s \"Juneteenth: The Story Behind the Celebration\" fills the void by exploring the Civil War origins of Juneteenth.\n\nCotham renders explicit the military context leading up to the events on June 19, 1865, in Galveston. This is when enslaved Black people there finally got word that they had been freed more than two years prior. Cotham reminds readers that the history of Juneteenth involves ordinary actions of many individual people whose names may not be widely known.\n\nCollectively, these books about Juneteenth offer fresh perspectives on the history and culture of African Americans on a quest to fully express their freedom. Juneteenth is also an invitation for all Americans to continue to learn about and strive for freedom for all people.", "source": {"uri": "shethepeople.tv", "dataType": "news", "title":

Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved families, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among a lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive, with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\n\"Today, as we celebrate Juneteenth, together we are reminded of the promise of America,\" Harris said in opening remarks. \"A promise of freedom, liberty and opportunity, not for some but for all. In many ways, the story of Juneteenth and of our nation is a story of our ongoing fight to realize that promise.\"\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options for observing the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"\n\nAnderson never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it -- who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas they grew up, the more likely they were not to have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary depending on when word of emancipation reached each state.\n\nSearch online, and you will find a smorgasbord of gatherings in major cities and suburbs, all varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnivalesque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find access to professionals in health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black excellence and creativity. For those who want to look back, plenty of organizations and universities host panels to remind people of Juneteenth's history.\n\nFor the first time since Juneteenth was federally recognized, the National Park Service is making entry into all sites free on the holiday. Several parks will be hosting Juneteenth commemorations this week.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may also appear on the table.\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"", "source": {"uri": "kqed.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KQED"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbecue", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barbecue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gospel music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Codes_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black Codes (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_LaBelle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patti LaBelle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladys_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gladys Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King Jr. Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Community service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_velvet_cake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red velvet cake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kool-Aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kool-Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Park Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emory University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2023/06/RS66366_20230617_Juneteenth_KQED-35-KQED-1020x680.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Gen. Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3 in Galveston, Texas, proclaiming that enslaved African Americans were free. This was more than two years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nMany African Americans have commemorated Juneteenth with parties, parades and gatherings. The Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 moved Juneteenth to the forefront of national consciousness, and at least 28 states and Washington DC -- along with the federal government -- recognize Juneteenth as a public holiday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Others use it as a day of public service to volunteer in the community or advocate for issues affecting the Black American community. This year, Juneteenth falls on Wednesday, June 19. Here's what's open and closed on Juneteenth 2024.\n\nPostal services\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday for the United States Postal Service, so it will not deliver mail.\n\nHowever, all UPS and FedEx services will be open and available.\n\nFinancial services\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMarkets will be closed, and Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange will not be trading on Wednesday.\n\nJuneteenth is also a banking holiday observed by the Federal Reserve. Major banks like Chase and Bank of America will be closed in observance of the holiday. TD Bank, which has remained open in previous years, will also be closed Wednesday.\n\nAs always, online banking services and ATMs will be available for use.\n\nSchools and government agencies\n\nFederal offices will be closed on Juneteenth. Many schools will already be off for summer break.\n\nHowever, whether government or state employees in different places get a paid day off varies. In 2023, at least 28 states recognized Juneteenth as a public holiday for which state workers received a paid day off, according to a Pew Research analysis. Other states may hold a day of observance or other commemorations.\n\nRetailers\n\nMost major retailers and grocery stores will be open on Juneteenth. Walmart and Target, for example, will be open during normal hours. It's best to check if your local businesses and restaurants are also operating during normal hours for the holiday.\n\nCNN's Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report.\n\n6 books that explain the history and meaning of Juneteenth Reading recommendations\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It recognizes and celebrates a profound milestone in American history -- the declaration of freedom for an entire race of American people who had been held in bondage for centuries.\n\nAlthough the day itself -- June 19, 1865 -- was far less life-changing than it should have been.\n\nJuneteenth commemorates the arrival of Union Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger in Galveston, Texas, with General Order No. 3 telling the people of the westernmost Confederate state that \"all slaves are free.\" Although the Emancipation Proclamation had taken effect in 1863, it couldn't be implemented until the Civil War ended and Confederate states surrendered.\n\nConfederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered his troops to Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in April 1865 in Virginia, but other Confederate troops farther south and west continued fighting, surrendering only in the months afterward. The 13th Amendment abolishing slavery would be ratified in December 1865.\n\nEnslaved people in Texas were the last ones in the Confederacy to learn they were freed. But the news didn't filter across the state immediately. And some slave owners didn't obey the order right away, waiting to see who would enforce it.\n\nTexas may have been the last Confederate state to get word of emancipation, but in 1980 it became the first state to make it an official holiday.\n\nJuneteenth is now a federal holiday. It's also recognized as a state holiday in more than 25 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe 1865 announcement of freedom didn't end systemic racism and its discriminatory effects in housing, employment and education. It didn't stop the violence Black people faced day after day, and still do. Black people make up 13% of the U.S. population but account for 37% of the prison and jail population. Similarly, Black people are 37% of the homeless population nationwide.\n\nEfforts to address inequality such as affirmative action are under attack or scuttled. The movement to secure reparations for the ancestors of enslaved people hasn't gained traction in most states.\n\nBut there are reasons to celebrate this holiday. Juneteenth is about honoring fortitude, perseverance and, yes, optimism. Those are traits Americans have always had. And they are traits Black Americans have demonstrated in abundance for centuries -- otherwise, no Black people would have survived here. And Black communities have held celebrations big and small for Juneteenth since 1866.\n\nConsider Opal Lee. The former teacher is often called \"the grandmother of Juneteenth\" for her decades of activism to get it designated a federal holiday. When she was a young girl, her Texas home was burned down by a mob of white supremacists on Juneteeth in 1939.\n\nIn 2016, a month before she turned 90, Lee set off on a four-month walk from her hometown of Fort Worth to Washington, D.C., to publicize her cause. In 2021, Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support passed a bill making Juneteenth a federal holiday, and President Biden signed it into law.\n\nLast month, at 97, Lee stepped across the floor at a White House ceremony to be embraced by Biden as he placed the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, around her neck.\n\nLee told an interviewer that day: \"I keep saying over and over: From the 19th of June to the 4th of July, we should be celebrating freedom.\"", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Order No. 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

What you should know about Juneteenth (June 19, 2024)", "body": "Wednesday, June 19th is a federal holiday, meaning government offices will be closed and mail will not run. Juneteenth is the newest federal holiday and the first one established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was created in 1983.\n\nJuneteenth National Independence Day is a holiday steeped in history, recognizing one of the final acts of emancipation of slaves in the U.S.\n\nJuneteenth takes its name from the literal date on which it falls - June 19th. This year, it is celebrated on a Wednesday.\n\nEarlier this year, Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey announced Juneteenth will be a state holiday as well, a practice it has followed since 2021.\n\nWhat is Juneteenth?\n\nOn June 19, 1865, the announcement was made that tens of thousands of African-Americans in Texas had been emancipated, closing the door on one of the last chapters of slavery in the U.S.\n\nJuneteenth traces its origins back to Galveston, Texas where on June 19, 1865 Union soldiers, led by Major Gen. Gordon Granger landed in the city with news that the Civil War had ended and slaves were now free. The announcement came two-and-a-half years after President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of Jan. 1, 1863 that freed slaves in Confederate states. However, since that proclamation was made during the Civil War, it was ignored by Confederate states and it wasn't until the end of the war that the Executive Order was enforced in the South.\n\nGranger delivered the news himself, reading General Order Number 3:\n\n\"The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and free laborer.\"\n\nThe day's name is in honor of the date of Granger's announcement and first appeared around 1903. It is also known as African American Freedom Day or Emancipation Day.\n\nThe day was celebrated occasionally until it was revived during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nHow is Juneteenth being observed?\n\nMany of the Juneteenth special events are taking place in Washington, D.C. One special event is at the National Archives Museum that will display the original Emancipation Proclamation and General Order No. 3 through June 20th. The National Park Service is also waiving visitor entrance fees on June 19th.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

History also records June 17, 2021, as the day Juneteenth became a holiday for federal workers and Oct. 4, 2022, as the day Richland County Council added Juneteeth as a county holiday.\n\nBut history does not record when South Carolina, where more than one in four people are Black or African American, recognized Juneteenth as a holiday for state workers. Because it hasn't happened. Yet.\n\nSouth Carolina is the first state to secede from the Union, the state where the Civil War began and home to more than 2,000 plantations and many beautiful Juneteenth celebrations at this time of year. But its lawmakers have so far chosen not to commemorate a day as most other states have.\n\nState Sen. Darrell Jackson, D-Columbia, has introduced several bills to make Juneteenth a state holiday since 2019. He says it's the right thing and that it would keep state employment competitive with county and Columbia government jobs.\n\n\"I am looking forward to strongly pushing it next year,\" he told me this week. \"It probably should be the most celebrated day in the African American community.\n\n\"To me, it represents the best of this country.... It is not something that is antagonistic, although it is challenging. I'm not going to sugarcoat it, OK? But let's look at Juneteenth as the best of America. It is America correcting itself.\"\n\nTexas was the first state to make Juneteenth a permanent state holiday, in 1980. Twenty-five others followed in a wave of legislation following the massive protests over the murder of Minnesotan George Floyd in 2020. And at least five other states will give some state workers a paid day off or offer Juneteenth as a floating holiday this year by law or, as in Alabama and West Virginia, by gubernatorial action.\n\nNow the rest of the states need to act.\n\nMaybe, as sometimes happens, business leaders will force their hand.\n\nLast year, a Mercer study found 39% of employers have made Juneteenth a paid holiday, up from 33% in 2022 and from 9% in 2021. Mine is one. It's a paid holiday for employees of McClatchy, which owns The State, The Hilton Head Island Packet and the Myrtle Beach Sun News.\n\nIn a proclamation accompanying its observance in 2021, President Joe Biden called Juneteenth \"a day of profound weight and power,\" \"a day in which we remember the moral stain and terrible toll of slavery on our country\" and \"a day that also reminds us of our incredible capacity to heal, hope, and emerge from our darkest moments with purpose and resolve.\"\n\nThe same reflection and resolve is needed at the state level. Perhaps next year is the year South Carolina lawmakers embrace the change.\n\nIf they are looking for a reason to give state workers this paid holiday, they could consider that state productivity already dips because some employees take it off to celebrate with family and friends now or that the state is one of only a few to close its offices to commemorate Confederate Memorial Day May 10.\n\nFor now, everyone should pause to reflect, and rejoice in our shared humanity. There are plenty of ways to mark Juneteenth. Sen. Jackson says you could sit in a slave cabin or walk past the gravestones in one of the state's plantations. You could visit one of 400-plus African American cultural sites listed in the Green Book of South Carolina, shop or eat at a Black-owned business, get into the Columbia Museum of Art for free to see the work of Black artists or read any number of poignant books, such as \"James\" by Percival Everett.\n\nWhatever you do, spend some time considering the history, the complexity and all the hard-fought freedoms of this country we call home while celebrating its people, food, culture and the better angels of our nature.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news",

Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce that slavery had been abolished. Texas was the last state where it was being practiced, and communications being what they were at the time, word had not reached there until then.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln had issued the Emancipation Proclamation September 22, 1862, and it took effect January 1, 1863, freeing slaves in all states that had seceded and joined the Confederacy -- not that it was possible to enforce it universally, as the Civil War would continue nearly two and a half years longer. Gen. Robert E. Lee, the top Confederate commander, surrendered in April 1865, but Confederate forces in the west kept on fighting, finally surrendering on June 2. By then, many Southerners had brought the people they held in slavery to Texas, considered out of the reach of the Union Army.\n\nGranger \"had no idea that, in establishing the Union Army's authority over the people of Texas, he was also establishing the basis for a holiday, 'Juneteenth' ('June' plus 'nineteenth'), today the most popular annual celebration of emancipation from slavery in the United States,\" historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. wrote in an essay published a few years ago on The Root and PBS.org.\n\nLife remained brutal for formerly enslaved Black people in Texas and elsewhere long after the end of the Civil War. In Texas, some slaveholders didn't deliver the news to the people they held in bondage or simply failed to treat them as free, even though Granger's proclamation said former slaves should be considered \"hired labor\" and paid wages. African Americans who left their former masters were often hunted down and killed. The post-Civil War era known as Reconstruction allowed African Americans to exercise some political and economic rights, including voting and running for office. But the end of Reconstruction in 1877, with the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, meant there was no longer enforcement of any laws conferring those rights. Black people were disenfranchised, and many had to work as sharecroppers on the plantations where they had been enslaved. Racism was enshrined in laws, and lynching -- the murder of Black Americans for any perceived transgression -- became common.\n\nBut Black Americans persevered. In 1866, those in Texas celebrated the first anniversary of Juneteenth. The observances became a fixture in Texas over the succeeding years, with celebrants dressing in their finest clothes and gathering for a feast along with games, religious services, speeches, and political organizing. When white officials banned access to certain public parks, Black residents established their own spaces.\n\nAfrican Americans in other parts of the U.S. sometimes celebrated emancipation on other milestone dates -- September 22 or January 1 for the Emancipation Proclamation, January 31 for Congress's passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, abolishing slavery throughout the nation (a few states that allowed slavery had not seceded and were therefore not affected by the Emancipation Proclamation), or a few other dates. But as Black Texans migrated to other states, they brought the Juneteenth tradition with them -- plus the date was one that usually promised good weather for outdoor events.\n\nJuneteenth observances waned somewhat by the mid-20th century, as a romanticized, hugely inaccurate view of the antebellum South had spread through the nation, and racist laws and attitudes endured. But interest in the date was renewed in the 1960s with the civil rights movement. Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had been planning a Poor People's March, highlighting class inequality, at the time of his assassination in April 1968. His colleagues went ahead with the plan, but the march was not as large as they had hoped, so they ended it ahead of schedule -- on June 19, 1968. That brought new attention to the date's significance, and since then Juneteenth has been celebrated widely.\n\nIt was a state holiday first. Texas passed a bill in 1979 making it a state holiday; the bill's champion was Rep. Al Edwards, who became known as \"Mr. Juneteenth.\" More than 40 other states and the District of Columbia went on to give Juneteenth some form of recognition, but few had made it a paid holiday.\n\nThen in 2021, President Joe Biden signed a bill into law establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day. The bill's leading sponsors included Democratic Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of Texas, Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, and Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts. Before Kamala Harris became Biden's vice president, she had championed the action as a U.S. senator. Support for making Juneteenth a federal holiday had gained momentum after the widespread outrage over the murder of Black man George Floyd by Minneapolis police in 2020. It was the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established in 1983.\n\nBiden said signing the bill was \"one of the greatest honors I will have as president.\" He noted that Opal Lee, an activist who had pushed tirelessly for the move, was present at the ceremony, and he pointed out that establishing the holiday was merely a step toward equality. \"We can't rest until the promise of equality if fulfilled for every one of us in every corner of this nation. That to me is the meaning of Juneteenth,\" Biden said.", "source": {"uri": "advocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gay News, LGBT Rights, Politics, Entertainment"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reconstruction era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Louis_Gates_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Henry Louis Gates Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

Gen. Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3 in Galveston, Texas, proclaiming that enslaved African Americans were free. This was more than two years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nMany African Americans have commemorated Juneteenth with parties, parades and gatherings. The Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 moved Juneteenth to the forefront of national consciousness, and at least 28 states and Washington DC -- along with the federal government -- recognize Juneteenth as a public holiday.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Others use it as a day of public service to volunteer in the community or advocate for issues affecting the Black American community. This year, Juneteenth falls on Wednesday, June 19. Here's what's open and closed on Juneteenth 2024.\n\nPostal services\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday for the United States Postal Service, so it will not deliver mail.\n\nHowever, all UPS and FedEx services will be open and available.\n\nFinancial services\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nMarkets will be closed, and Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange will not be trading on Wednesday.\n\nJuneteenth is also a banking holiday observed by the Federal Reserve. Major banks like Chase and Bank of America will be closed in observance of the holiday. TD Bank, which has remained open in previous years, will also be closed Wednesday.\n\nAs always, online banking services and ATMs will be available for use.\n\nSchools and government agencies\n\nFederal offices will be closed on Juneteenth. Many schools will already be off for summer break.\n\nHowever, whether government or state employees in different places get a paid day off varies. In 2023, at least 28 states recognized Juneteenth as a public holiday for which state workers received a paid day off, according to a Pew Research analysis. Other states may hold a day of observance or other commemorations.\n\nRetailers\n\nMost major retailers and grocery stores will be open on Juneteenth. Walmart and Target, for example, will be open during normal hours. It's best to check if your local businesses and restaurants are also operating during normal hours for the holiday.\n\nCNN's Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report.\n\n6 books that explain the history and meaning of Juneteenth Reading recommendations\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Summer Lee and Angela Stribling are pictured at the 2023 Swissvale's Juneteenth festival\n\nAngela Stribling and Shawn Alfonso Wells were walking out of the council building following a Juneteenth committee meeting, and they were able to hand Swissvale's Juneteenth flyer to a few young children. Stribling recalls the young girl shrieking as she said, \"Oh my gosh, the Bill Henry Band! My grandma will be so excited about this.\"\n\n\"That's why we are doing this work. It's bigger than us. It's for the next generations,\" Stribling, a borough councilperson and member of the Juneteenth Committee, said.\n\nThis is the third year of Swissvale's Juneteenth celebration, which is taking place on Sunday, June 23, from noon to 8 p.m. at Les Getz Memorial Park, presented by the Juneteenth Committee within Swissvale's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee.\n\nFreedom for Black people is an ongoing fight and journey. Juneteenth is a day of pride, celebration of life, and celebration of love, many of the Juneteenth Committee members said.\n\nIt's also a celebration of the liberation of slaves and the abolishment of slavery, Stribling said.\n\nJuneteenth is the celebration of June 19, 1865, when enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, were notified of their freedom. However, in Texas, enslaved people had already been legally freed with the Emancipation Proclamation that was passed in 1863, two years prior.\n\nBy the time June 19, 1865, came, the Civil War had ended and many slaves were considered free, with the official abolishment of slavery coming in December 1865 with the ratification of the 13th Amendment.\n\nThe first Juneteenth celebrations were about celebrating that freedom and trying to reunite with family members who were separated due to enslavement. Stribling credits longtime teacher Opal Lee, considered the \"Grandmother of Juneteenth,\" with Juneteenth gaining national recognition.\n\n\"This holiday is so amazing because it encapsulates the celebration of us,\" Fred Quinn, a Juneteenth Committee member, said, \"in a way that we as Black people typically celebrate... outside, with cookouts and dancing.\"\n\n\"When we think about Juneteenth, we think about socio-economic systems that have been put into place that have hindered us,\" Shawn Alfonso Wells, vice president of Swissvale Council and member of the Juneteenth Committee, said.\n\nGaining freedom during Juneteenth is not the end of the story, because what followed was the Jim Crow era, then the Civil Rights Movement, and a continuous fight toward liberation for Black people.\n\n\"This is making sure people understand how precious freedom is and that you are not necessarily completely free until you free yourself from the systems that keep your brain shackled. There is still work to do,\" she said.\n\nAlfonso Wells points to injustices like those taking place in Florida, teaching about the benefits of enslavement, as well as the denial of reparations to Oklahoma Tulsa Race Massacre survivors, which she said were \"legislative bodies that are trying to put into place actions so that people will never understand what their history is,\" she said.\n\n\"African Americans, although we are free, there are still things in society that deem that we cannot be who we are. Juneteenth is about pride in yourself, pride knowing that people have accomplished things. If you look at Pittsburgh specifically, the Black female mortality rate is higher than anywhere else,\" Alfonso Wells said.\n\nFor Black women in Pittsburgh, she said, it is necessary to have that pride and to demand their personhood be acknowledged, \"so that when you go to that doctor's appointment and that doctor is telling you you're fine, you'll say, 'I know that I'm having an issue and I would like it to be addressed.'\"\n\nStribling said that this event taking place is also an accomplishment and adds to the legacy of community in Swissvale. \"Juneteenth is our way of being proud of ourselves. The best thing about this community is that the entire community shows up. We see a lot of different Swissvalians coming out. Everybody is welcome.\"\n\nSwissvale's Juneteenth Committee is multicultural, including members Fred Quinn, Weldianne Scales, Leland Scales, Vladimir Alfonso Pillot, Andrea Scapicchio, George Thomas, Natasha Tokowicz, Shawn Alfonso Wells and Angela Stribling\n\nQuinn became a council member last year and this was his first year on the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee and being able to assist in the Juneteenth planning. For Quinn, Juneteenth means liberation. \"I think that it's important for us now, certainly after the George Floyd protests, to show what liberation looks like, especially to our younger generation,\" Quinn said.\n\nQuinn said that Juneteenth is something that America as a whole is learning more about as we go along. \"Slavery was the biggest blood stain on this country since its inception. Our freedom needs to be celebrated, especially now when our rights are still in jeopardy,\" Quinn said.\n\n\"I'm not only Black, but I'm openly queer as well. So with Juneteenth being in Pride Month, it is empowering. Liberation is freedom for all minorities, for all underserved communities, and being able to stand with each other fighting for the voiceless,\" Quinn said.\n\nAttendees of Swissvale's Juneteenth Committee can expect a historical explanation and remembrance of Juneteenth, a bike raffle, a mini job fair, spoken word performances, free haircuts, multiple food vendors, face painting, a bounce house, musical performances, and more. There will also be performances from members of the Divine Nine, which represent the nine historically Black Greek-letter organizations.\n\n\"It is a full showcasing and celebration of the Black experience,\" Stribling said.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shaylah_brown@triblive.com", "name": "Shaylah Brown", "type": "author",

Ultimately, chattel slavery was outlawed by the 13th Amendment, and Black people in the United States were able to shed the bonds of slavery in 1865. Though the story of the African Diaspora includes a variety of independence days, Juneteenth is unique to African Americans.\n\nWhile many would agree that the holiday should be observed solely by African Americans, others believe it represents a larger meaning of freedom and equality and can be celebrated by all beyond the nation's border.\n\n\"Juneteenth commemorates the day when 250,000 slaves in the state of Texas, which became the last bastion for slavery during the final days of Civil War, were declared free by the U.S Army,\" said Professor of Practice at the Morgan State University, Wayne Dawkins.\n\n\"I see the holiday as a teaching moment, I believe it's important that the people within the African Diaspora know the history of slavery and the struggles of their ancestors.\"\n\nThe celebration of this holiday began in 1866, when Texas hosted their Juneteenth festivities, which included prayer gatherings, and the wearing of new garments as a symbol of liberation. The celebration has now grown to include speeches, family get-togethers and educational activities.\n\nOpal Lee is recognized as the \"Mother of Juneteenth,\" for her campaign to get national recognition for the holiday, which became an official federal holiday in 2021 after being a state holiday in Texas for more than 40 years.\n\nWhile Juneteenth is well-known and celebrated within the African-American community, many Americans were unaware of the holiday before 2021, and others are still in the dark about the true history of the event.\n\nTyra-Neil Morrison an information systems and technology student at Morgan State University (MSU) and the president of the university's Caribbean Student Association (CSA) said she \"didn't really know much about certain Black American cultures and customs,\" she only learned about Juneteenth when she started college.\n\n\"My knowledge expanded when I came to an HBCU (Historically Black college or university). My friends that were from different backgrounds would invite me to their homes for cookouts and to talk about Black history,\" said Morrison.\n\nShe said even though her native country does not celebrate Juneteenth, she believes the holiday should be put in the schools curriculum to educate students on their cultural background.\n\nMorrison, who is of Jamaican descent, said that instead of recognizing Juneteenth, there are celebrations of Jamaican independence on August 6 of each year.\n\nBlack nations around the world have independence days that vary from country to country. In the Caribbean, the Haitian Revolution took place from 1791 to 1804. Haitians gained their independence on Jan. 1, 1804. In Africa, the nation of Nigeria gained independence on Oct. 1, 1960, just a few years after Ghana, which gained independence on March 6, 1957.\n\nPresident of the African Student Organization at Morgan State University, Afia-Ayisha Doreen Andoh, of Ghana, shared her views on the subject. Andoh believes Juneteenth should only be celebrated by African Americans in the United States.\n\n\"I think it's important to be celebrated by the U.S., but not necessarily through Africa and Caribbean countries,\" said Andoh.\n\nDespite the different views on the celebration of Juneteenth, Dawkins argued that the holiday should be used as a teaching method. He believes the holiday should be \"commemorated and not celebrated.\"\n\n\"I'm not telling anyone not to celebrate Juneteenth,\" said Dawkins, \"I just want them to be aware of the meaning of it and why we have it.\"", "source": {"uri": "afro.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AFRO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score":

We VERIFY how it became a federal holiday.\n\nJuneteenth is observed annually on June 19 to commemorate the day in 1865 when the last enslaved people in the United States learned they were free. It was first celebrated in Texas.\n\nAlthough the holiday, which is also known as \"Freedom Day\" or \"Emancipation Day,\" has long been celebrated in the Black American community, the significant event has not always had national recognition.\n\nSign up for the VERIFY Fast Facts newsletter here.\n\nJuneteenth officially became a federal holiday in the U.S. after President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act into law on June 17, 2021.\n\nThe story of how Juneteenth came to be begins on Jan. 1, 1863, when President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War. The Emancipation Proclamation declared that all enslaved people in states that had seceded from the United States \"shall be free.\"\n\nBut the Emancipation Proclamation was limited in many ways, according to the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\nThe National Archives says the Emancipation Proclamation applied only to states that had seceded from the Union and did not affect the status of slaves in loyal border states. It also exempted parts of the Confederacy that were already under Union control. Most importantly, the freedom the Emancipation Proclamation promised depended upon a Union military victory against the Confederate army.\n\nThat meant the proclamation had little impact on the enslaved people in Texas at that time \"due to the small number of Union troops available to enforce it,\" according to the Galveston Historical Foundation.\n\nIt wasn't until June 19, 1865, more than two and half years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, when Union Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger and his 2,000 troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, over two months after Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in Virginia.\n\nWhile in Galveston, Granger announced through the reading of General Order No. 3 that the Civil War was over and the more than 250,000 enslaved people in the state were now free.\n\n\"The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired laborer,\" Granger read.\n\nSlavery was permanently abolished six months later, when Georgia ratified the 13th Amendment on Dec. 6, 1865. The next year, in 1866, the newly freed people of Galveston started celebrating Juneteenth, an observance that has continued and spread around the world. Annual Juneteenth events include concerts, parades, festivals, art exhibits and readings of the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nThe national reckoning over race ignited by the 2020 murder of George Floyd helped set the stage for Juneteenth to become the first new federal holiday since 1983, when Martin Luther King Jr. Day was created. Juneteenth National Independence Day is now the 12th federal holiday observed in the U.S.\n\nAs a result, post offices, banks and the stock market will be closed.", "source": {"uri": "9news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KUSA.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "assets@9news.com", "name": "assets", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Archives and Records Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secession in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_states_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Border states (American Civil War)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Order No. 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King Jr. Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

A day to rededicate ourselves to the ongoing and unfinished work of our American experiment.\"\n\n:: Galveston, Texas\n\nU.S. government employees have the day off from work.\n\nSo do workers at some private businesses.\n\nTraditionally, Juneteenth celebrations include parades, marches and barbecues.\n\nThis year's holiday is expected to take place during a heat wave in some parts of the country so officials are advising people to be careful.\n\nOther events will strike a more somber tone, with organizers using the day to draw attention to today's racial inequities they say stem from the legacy of slavery and structural racism.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans",

National Bacon Day. National Sock Day (shoutout to Rep. John Curtis). National Spaghetti Day. You get the idea. On June 19, the newsletter shoutout will be for Juneteenth.\n\nBut Juneteenth isn't just another \"made-up holiday.\" It marks an important (and sad) moment when all slaves were finally freed (at least on paper). Texas was a hold out for nearly two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation and two months after the end of the Civil War. The emancipating of a quarter-million slaves in Texas had to be enforced by some 2000 Union troops arriving in Galveston on June 19, 1865.\n\nSometimes change is hard. Just because troops arrived didn't mean that slaves were actually free. Henry Louis Gates Jr., wrote that \"even in Galveston city, the ex-Confederate mayor flouted the Army by forcing the freed people back to work.\"\n\nOur family celebrates Juneteenth now, with stories about why we have the holiday observance and, of course, with food. That hasn't always been the case.\n\nOne of my older children has asked me why we now observe the holiday when we didn't used to. Easy answer. I didn't know about it. I never learned about the reasons behind Juneteenth when I was in school. Neither did my husband, and neither did my older children as they moved through the Utah school system. In fact, a Gallup poll in 2021 found that 68% of white American adults knew \"little\" or \"nothing\" about Juneteenth, while 96% of Black American adults knew at least a little.\n\nNow we know, and so we mark that day every year. As Maya Angelou said: \"When you know better, do better.\"\n\nWhen we first heard about Juneteenth and realized it was an important day we should observe, we knew we needed to celebrate with food. We went looking for recipes online. We found some that have been big hits and some that only my husband and I enjoy (peanut soup). Some of our favorites are Caribbean smothered chicken, rice and red beans, baked corn, red drink (alcohol-free) and red velvet cake.\n\nYou might notice a color theme with at least some of the food: the color red. It \"symbolizes the bloodshed and the profound sacrifices made by former enslaved Black Americans,\" according to food historian Adrian E. Miller and CNN. Red is a royal color in African society, \"adding depth to the folklore surrounding Juneteenth.\"\n\nEarlier this spring, PBS published a list of children's books to help families learn about Juneteenth, from celebratory board books to an easy family cookbook to a story told through quilt-style art, there are numerous ways to learn together.\n\nI asked one of my Black children how they felt when our family started celebrating Juneteenth. They said that it was never taught in school, but when we began observing the holiday, they thought it was \"cool to learn more about it and embrace it.\"\n\nNow, they \"think it's a time to reflect and celebrate my Blackness. We look back on history but we are also celebrating Black joy and pride.\"\n\nIf this is your first year celebrating Juneteenth, The Associated Press has published a handy-dandy guide for beginners. It includes information about whether the day is a solemn occasion or a party (yes), ideas on food, greetings and celebrating when you're not Black.\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University who focuses on race in her research, said \"there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\"\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

It recognizes and celebrates a profound milestone in American history -- the declaration of freedom for an entire race of American people who were held in bondage for centuries.\n\nThe day itself, June 19, 1865, was far less life-changing than it should have been.\n\nJuneteenth commemorates the arrival of Union Army Major Gen. Gordon Granger in Galveston, Texas, with General Order No. 3 telling the people of the westernmost Confederate state that \"all slaves are free.\" Although the Emancipation Proclamation took effect in 1863, it couldn't be implemented until the Civil War ended and Confederate states surrendered.\n\nConfederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered his troops to Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in April 1865 in Virginia, but other Confederate troops further south and west continued fighting, surrendering only in the months afterward. The 13th Amendment abolishing slavery was ratified in December 1865.\n\nEnslaved people in Texas were the last ones in the Confederacy to find out they were freed. But the news didn't filter across the state immediately. and some slave owners didn't obey the order right away, waiting to see who would enforce it.\n\nTexas may have been the last Confederate state to get word of emancipation, but in 1980 it became the first U.S. state to make it an official holiday.\n\nJuneteenth is now a federal holiday. It's also recognized as a state holiday in more than 25 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe 1865 announcement of freedom didn't end systemic racism and its discriminatory effects in housing, employment and education. It didn't stop the violence Black people faced day after day, and still do. Black people make up 13% of the U.S. population but account for 37% of the prison and jail population. Similarly, Black people are 37% of the homeless population nationwide.\n\nEfforts to address inequality, such as affirmative action, are under attack or scuttled. The movement to secure reparations for the ancestors of enslaved people hasn't gained traction in most states.\n\nBut there are reasons to celebrate this holiday. Juneteenth is about honoring fortitude, perseverance and, yes, optimism. Those are traits Americans have always had. and they are traits Black Americans have demonstrated in abundance for centuries -- otherwise, no Black people would have survived here. Black communities have held celebrations big and small for Juneteenth since 1866.\n\nConsider Opal Lee. The former teacher is often called \"the grandmother of Juneteenth\" for her decades of activism to get it designated a federal holiday. When she was a young girl, her Texas home was burned down by a mob of white supremacists on Juneteenth in 1939.\n\nIn 2016, a month before she turned 90, Lee set off on a four-month walk from her hometown of Fort Worth to Washington, D.C., to publicize her cause. In 2021, Congress - with overwhelming bipartisan support - passed a bill making Juneteenth a federal holiday, and President Joe Biden signed it into law.\n\nLast month, at 97, Lee stepped across the floor at a White House ceremony to be embraced by Biden as he placed the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, around her neck.\n\nLee told an interviewer that day, \"I keep saying over and over: From the 19th of June to the 4th of July, we should be celebrating freedom.\"\n\nIndeed, all Americans, of all backgrounds, should.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Order No. 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

The 13th Amendment brought an end to slavery.\n\nKnown as America's second Independence Day, Juneteenth is a reminder of African Americans' strength and resilience over centuries.\n\nThough it didn't become a national holiday until 2021, it's been celebrated since 1865. Union troops liberated slaves in Galveston, Texas, to signal the end of slavery.\n\nThough Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation went into effect in 1863, it didn't reach states still under confederate control until years later.\n\nTexas was the last state to sustain slavery. More than 250,000 enslaved people were freed when Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, on June 19, 1865.\n\nMore: St. John Colony, Texas, celebrates 150 years of Juneteenth jubilees\n\nAt the onset of Reconstruction, formerly enslaved people built a community and even sued slaveholders for compensation, according to Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\nWhy is Juneteenth important in 2024?\n\nJuneteenth is a reminder of what African Americans went through, according to Mary Elliott, the curator of American Slavery at the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture. But it's fluid, she said, and has evolved to meet the needs of society today.\n\n\"Juneteenth is also a site for political knowledge,\" Elliott wrote. \"It's a time to recognize that you need to be registered to vote. You need to know what's going on in your own city. You need to take control of your civic duty.\"\n\nAre there Juneteenth traditions?\n\nThe color red is most associated with cultures that came to America during the later years of the Transatlantic slave trade. It represents sacrifice, transition and power, according to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.\n\nFamilies gather to learn, celebrate and eat red foods like strawberry slab pie, barbecue and dishes with tomato sauce.\n\nWhen did Juneteenth become a federal holiday?\n\nJuneteenth became a national holiday June 18, 2021, with a proclamation from President Joe Biden. The acknowledgement came as America grappled over the treatment of people of color by police and other institutions following the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.\n\n\"On Juneteenth, we recommit ourselves to the work of equity, equality, and justice. And, we celebrate the centuries of struggle, courage, and hope that have brought us to this time of progress and possibility,\" Biden wrote in his proclamation. \"That work has been led throughout our history by abolitionists and educators, civil rights advocates and lawyers, courageous activists and trade unionists, public officials, and everyday Americans who have helped make real the ideals of our founding documents for all.\"\n\nAs it is a federal holiday, banks and credit unions will be closed.\n\nAllie Feinberg reports on politics for Knox News.

Despite occurring on June 19, 1865, it took until 2021 for Juneteenth to receive recognition as a federal holiday, which means widespread acknowledgment of this momentous day is far overdue.\n\nSo, how can you explain Juneteenth to your kids in a way that will make sense to them, particularly if they're not quite old enough to understand the deep-seated horrors inflicted upon Black Americans for decades? It's not only possible, but it's essential, especially as lawmakers in several states continue their crusade against honest and inclusive discussions about race in schools across the country.\n\nThough President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation into law on Jan. 1, 1863, it took two and a half years for all enslaved African Americans to be freed. In fact, the Emancipation Proclamation did not immediately free a single enslaved person since the executive order signed by Lincoln only applied to states that had succeeded from the Union, including Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, sections of Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, and sections of Virginia -- all Confederate states. Lincoln did not apply the order to Union states (namely, those in the North) to prevent them from rebelling and joining the Confederacy. Yet another f*cked-up layer to the racist practice of white people in power using Black lives as a bargaining chip to preserve white supremacy.\n\nStill, the Emancipation Proclamation did mark a turning point in the fight against slavery, as Black Americans continued to fight for liberation across the country. It wasn't until June 19, 1865, when Major General Gordon Granger and his Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, to free the remaining 250,000 enslaved Americans by force.\n\nThe 13th Amendment, which Lincoln had issued for approval in Congress on Feb. 1 of that year, was officially ratified by the majority of states on Dec. 6, 1865, making slavery illegal in the United States Constitution and abolishing slavery nationwide once and for all.\n\nBut it's Juneteenth -- a portmanteau of June and nineteenth -- that symbolizes Independence Day for Black Americans, who first celebrated the occasion a year later, in 1866, and have marked the historic occasion every year since. According to the Texas State Historical Association, early celebrations included newly-freed Black Americans helping each other learn about their voting rights, along with social gatherings including picnics, pageants, parades, barbecues, ball games, cookouts, church services, rodeos, and horseback riding.\n\nDespite decades of activists fighting for Juneteenth to be named a national holiday, it wasn't until President Joe Biden signed into law a bill signifying Juneteenth National Independence Day in 2021, over a year after the murder of George Floyd sparked global protests against racism in the United States.\n\nFor younger kids, it's great to note that before computers and smartphones, information did not travel at a high speed. So, a physical copy of the Emancipation Proclamation had to travel from place to place. It was read aloud at each stop, freeing enslaved people along the way, until finally making it to Galveston, Texas, two and a half years after being issued by President Lincoln.\n\nJanice Robinson-Celeste, an early childhood specialist, parent educator, and publisher and CEO of Successful Black Parenting, suggests starting the conversation by asking your child what they know about Juneteenth and going from there. \"Leave out the details of the atrocities and keep the explanation simple,\" she tells Scary Mommy.\n\nTry this, says Robinson-Celeste: \"There was a time when people in our country were not free to travel, buy things, get paid for their work, or even stay with their families. These people were 'enslaved.' In 1865, they finally learned they were free, and today we celebrate that with a big party and parades. Juneteenth is a happy day where we remember and celebrate that everyone should be treated fairly and have the same freedoms. We celebrate with music, food, and stories.\"\n\nActivities are also an excellent way to help your child understand and appreciate Juneteenth.\n\n\"Say to your child, 'Let's draw a picture of what freedom looks like to you. Maybe it's playing at the park, reading books, or being with family. That's what Juneteenth celebrates -- everyone's right to enjoy life and be happy,'\" says Robinson-Celeste, adding, \"Another nice way to celebrate Juneteenth is by attending local events or making a celebratory banner with your children to hang in your home to honor freedom.\"\n\nFor Black families, Robinson-Celeste says, \"One of the most important ways families can celebrate Juneteenth is by parents sharing the history of our emancipation accurately and in an age-appropriate manner.\"\n\nThough it might not be age-appropriate to discuss the specific injustices experienced by enslaved Black people, children do need to learn about the struggles of those who have come before them.\n\nThe Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) recommends rooting young children in the concept of history in general. A solid starting point: \"History is everything that has already happened, like breakfast this morning or even longer ago. Slavery in America happened before either of us were born and even before your grandparents were born.\"\n\nThe NMAAHC notes that children can begin to understand the implications of slavery by age 6, but they advise against the first conversations about Black American history focusing solely on Black trauma. It's equally important to honor Black culture, Black joy, and the strength and resilience born out of necessity to survive, all of which persist in the present day.\n\nInstead of overloading your child with a lot of information all at once, inviting conversation here and there can help them process such a critical part of American history.\n\nPut simply, you can explain that slavery was when one person \"owned\" another person, an unjust practice put in place by European settlers, who forced Africans into indentured servitude against their will, moving them away from their families and their homeland to the newly colonized United States. Millions of Black Americans remained enslaved for centuries, until the final enslaved people were freed in 1865.\n\nDistilling it down into right versus wrong will help kids understand that slavery was never OK, and that Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom for enslaved folks and the generations that have come since. Freedom means the ability to express your thoughts and beliefs, as well as to pursue what makes you feel happy and safe. Remind your child that it is just as crucial to fight for the freedom of all people now as it was then, especially since not all people are treated equally today.\n\nThree questions you can ask your child, per the NMAAHC:\n\nTweens and teens should be able to understand the history in its totality, which means painting a complete and accurate picture is essential. You can then discuss the ways that racial injustice persists today, with states enforcing racist policies and laws at various points throughout history, practices that still oppress Black Americans and prevent them from accessing everything from healthcare to education, housing, and so much more.\n\nWhitewashing history means we can never learn from it, but Juneteenth represents hope, freedom, and the prospect of a brighter future for Black Americans. Discussing it with your kids will help them understand both how far we've come and how much work we desperately need to do to protect and support our Black neighbors and friends.", "source": {"uri":

Here's how it'll celebrate this year", "body": "Americans will celebrate Juneteenth for the fourth year since it was recognized as a federal holiday in 2021. But for many families in Galveston, Texas, where the holiday originated, celebrations have been a mainstay for generations.\n\nJune 19th commemorates the fall of slavery in Galveston in 1865 -- two years after the Emancipation Proclamation ordered the liberation of Black people held in the Confederacy.\n\n\"I have newspaper records of my great-grandfather -- who was by this time, in 1885, he would have been 25 years old -- and he was given the role of reading the Emancipation Proclamation at that celebration,\" said 67-year-old Roy Collins.\n\nCollins grew up in Galveston and said his family lineage in the city dates back to the end of the Civil War.\n\nHe says the holiday was always recognized and celebrated by Black people in the city for as far back as he can trace.\n\n\"I can remember my mother telling us stories about there being large gatherings in the city park and people would have roasted meats,\" Collins recounts.\n\n\"My father and his friends were very creative with the barbecue experience. They would use meats that you could recognize, and they also had some meats that no one could recognize, and you just didn't want to ask too many questions about what that meat was,\" he recalled with amusement.\n\n\"I just enjoyed the lightness of it.\"\n\nTo celebrate this year -- as it does most years -- the island city will host a reading of General Order No. 3, which served to enforce freeing those still held in slavery; a historic march recreating the early freedom celebrations; and even a swanky Juneteenth gala that runs $400 a table.\n\nCandace Reese is another Texan who considers Galveston her hometown.\n\nHer grandfather, Rev. James B. Thomas, was instrumental in getting Juneteenth celebrated as a Texas state holiday in the 1970s.\n\n\"He was intentional about making sure that the young people were participants,\" Reese said.\n\nShe recalled her grandfather standing on a street corner with a megaphone yelling: \"Galveston's only known for two things: hurricanes and Juneteenth. Why don't you celebrate Juneteenth?\"\n\nA former Ms. Juneteenth, Reese -- who was raised in Dallas -- would travel to Galveston every summer for Juneteenth, marching and showing off dance moves in the parade.\n\nReese's family's 180-year history in Galveston is long and storied. Her great-great-great grandfather was John Menard Thomas, once enslaved by Michel Menard, the co-founder of the city.\n\nAs part of the celebrations, a recent tradition for Reese and her family is a \"freedom tour\" of the island, including the historic Menard House, where her ancestors spent much of their lives enslaved.\n\nAlso key in Reese's honoring the holiday is supporting Black businesses on Juneteenth, and the 19th of every month.\n\n\"Juneteenth is about economic empowerment for those who are the descendants of those who were enslaved because there's so much ground still that each generation has to make up,\" she said.\n\nTorin Collins considers herself lucky to have grown up in a culture that celebrates Juneteenth. Her family owns a former Confederate plantation in the state, and every year, her father hosts a massive Juneteenth celebration to educate and connect the community.\n\n\"The nation is kind of playing catchup,\" she said. \"I was raised with the awareness of, like, how important Juneteenth is and how much we need to remember history, and where we started, and kind of that dark chapter that everyone tries to sweep under the rug,\" she said.\n\nCollins' favorite memories of Juneteenth growing up include reenactments of the reading of the Emancipation Proclamation and Frederick Douglass' scathing oration \"What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?\" as the family grilled hot dogs and hamburgers on the land where Black people were once held in bondage.\n\nCollins has since moved away from her hometown and has settled in Florida while she works on a graduate degree, but she said she carries the memories and the message of Galveston and Juneteenth with her always.\n\n\"I've lived abroad, I've lived all over the country. You know, no matter where I go, I'll carry that history and honor my ancestors, and honor their struggle for freedom and their participation in the struggle for freedom.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alana_wise@npr.org", "name": "Alana Wise", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Order No. 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbecue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbecue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_cyclone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tropical cyclone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_complexes_in_the_Southern_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plantation complexes in the Southern United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frederick Douglass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamburger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hot dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Celebrity_Memorabilia", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Celebrity Memorabilia", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Death_Care/Online_Memorials", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Death Care/Online Memorials", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/6000x3375+0+313/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4a%2Fa4%2F8688c7314042b66de363a6f6d1cf%2Fap20169684835507.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 235, "textEnd": 244}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Through this holiday, the country commemorates the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of African-American slaves in the United States.\n\nJuneteenth is one of the eleven federal holidays celebrated in the United States. This is the newest celebration to be added to the federal calendar. It was only in 2021 when President Joe Biden signed a law to make Juneteenth Day an official nationwide holiday.\n\nPrior to President Biden's proclamation, only 47 of the nation's 50 states, plus the District of Columbia, recognized Juneteenth Day as an official celebration. However, after pressure from the Black Lives Matter movement, legislation was finally signed to make the celebration a federal holiday.\n\nREAD ALSO: The US representatives that voted against the Juneteenth federal holiday\n\nREAD ALSO: Juneteenth Day celebration: What is it and why is it celebrated?\n\nAs the celebration is considered a holiday at the national level, federal institutions suspend work, granting a paid day off to their employees. The day off only applies to the public sector, which means private companies and institutions reserve the right to give paid time off to their employees.\n\nThe USPS has announced that all post offices will be closed for retail transactions, and regular residential or business mail deliveries will be suspended for the holiday.\n\nUPS and Fedex pickup and delivery services will be available on June 19.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System and U.S. stock markets will be closed on Wednesday, along with most banks, including Capital One, Bank of America, PNC, Truist, CitiBank and JPMorgan Chase. Majority of financial institutions follow the federal holiday calendar.\n\nHowever, automated teller machines and mobile banking will operate normally for those who need to conduct some financial transactions.\n\nWith the proclamation of Juneteenth Day, the number of official holidays increased to eleven.

Gordon Granger and his troops arrived at Galveston on June 19, 1865, with news that the war had ended and that the enslaved were now free. That was more than two months after Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in Virginia.\n\nGranger delivered General Order No. 3, which said: \"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.\"\n\nThe next year, the now-free people started celebrating Juneteenth in Galveston. Its observance has continued around the nation and the world since.

That year, former Gov. John Bel Edwards also started issuing proclamations giving state workers time off during the work week for the celebration.\n\nThe weekday observance has coincided with the federal Juneteenth National Independence Day, which was also started in 2021. Juneteenth was the first new federal holiday created since 1983, when Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established.\n\nJuneteenth is not listed in Louisiana law as a state holiday where state employees must be given time off, like New Year's Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Mardi Gras, Good Friday, Independence Day, Labor Day, Veteran's Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas.\n\nThe governor has flexibility to declare other state holidays through a proclamation, however.

Earlier this year, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey announced that Juneteenth will be a state holiday as well, a practice it has followed since 2021.\n\nSo, exactly what is Juneteenth?\n\nJune 19th of 1865, an announcement was made saying tens of thousands of African-Americans in Texas had been emancipated closing the door on one of the last chapters of slavery in the U.S. Juneteenth traces its origins all the way back to Galveston, Texas - where Union soldiers led by Major General Gordon Granger - landed in the city, with news that the Civil War had ended and slaves were now FREE.\n\nThat announcement came two-and-a-half years after President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1st, 1863 - which freed slaves in Confederate states. However, since that proclamation was made during the Civil War, it was ignored by Confederate states and it wasn't until the end of the war that the Executive Order was enforced in the South.\n\nHow is Juneteenth being observed?\n\nMany Juneteenth special events are taking place in Washington, D.C., and one special event is at the National Archives Museum, which will display the Emancipation Proclamation and General Order No. 3 - through June 20th.\n\nThe National Park Service is also waiving Visitor Entrance Fees - on June 19th.", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King Jr. Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abolitionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Ivey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kay Ivey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Order No. 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Park_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Park Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives_and_Records_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Archives and Records Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US_Civil_War", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US Civil War", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://weisradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/juneteenth-use.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 20, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1654, "textEnd": 1663}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

That means some services might be closed on Wednesday.\n\nEfforts were underway as early as 1994 to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. In 1997, Congress began introducing resolutions annually commemorating the day.\n\nThe federal government now designates June 19 as \"Juneteenth National Independence Day.\" According to the Congressional Research Service, 28 states also recognize Juneteenth as a state holiday. In most of those states, state offices will close as well. Texas was the only state to recognize Juneteenth as a state holiday before 2013, having adopted it as a holiday starting in 1980.\n\nMissouri adopted the day as a public holiday in 2013. Pennsylvania became the third state to make it a public holiday in 2019. Twenty-five other states have since made the day a holiday.\n\nHere is a look at what's closed:\n\n- Nonessential federal offices, courthouses\n\n- U.S. post offices\n\n- Most banks\n\n- Stock markets\n\n- Many public schools, city and state offices\n\nEssential government offices, like the National Weather Service, will remain open. Also, U.S. national parks and Smithsonian museums remain open on Wednesday.\n\nExamples of nonessential offices closed on Wednesday include the Social Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service.\n\nMost retailers will keep their normal Wednesday hours for the day, although some might offer the day as a holiday to their employees.\n\nThe origins of Juneteenth date back to June 19, 1865, when slaves in Galveston, Texas, finally learned that President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation nearly 30 months earlier.\n\nAccording to the Smithsonian, Union General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston that day to deliver the news to the last remaining slaves in the U.S. Once they were freed, slavery officially came to an end in the U.S.", "source": {"uri":

Gen. Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3 in Galveston, Texas, proclaiming that enslaved African Americans were free. This was more than two years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nMany African Americans have commemorated Juneteenth with parties, parades and gatherings. The Black Lives Matter movement in 2020 moved Juneteenth to the forefront of national consciousness, and at least 28 states and Washington DC -- along with the federal government -- recognize Juneteenth as a public holiday.\n\nInvestigator tracked Kim Gardner to health clinic as St. Louis prosecutor's office crashed Here are 13 must-visit restaurants in the St. Louis area from Ian Froeb's newsletter New Channel 32?

Others use it as a day of public service to volunteer in the community or advocate for issues affecting the Black American community. This year, Juneteenth falls on Wednesday, June 19. Here's what's open and closed on Juneteenth 2024.\n\nPostal services\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday for the United States Postal Service, so it will not deliver mail.\n\nHowever, all UPS and FedEx services will be open and available.\n\nFinancial services\n\nMarkets will be closed, and Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange will not be trading on Wednesday.\n\nJuneteenth is also a banking holiday observed by the Federal Reserve. Major banks like Chase and Bank of America will be closed in observance of the holiday. TD Bank, which has remained open in previous years, will also be closed Wednesday.\n\nAs always, online banking services and ATMs will be available for use.\n\nSchools and government agencies\n\nFederal offices will be closed on Juneteenth. Many schools will already be off for summer break.\n\nHowever, whether government or state employees in different places get a paid day off varies. In 2023, at least 28 states recognized Juneteenth as a public holiday for which state workers received a paid day off, according to a Pew Research analysis. Other states may hold a day of observance or other commemorations.\n\nRetailers\n\nMost major retailers and grocery stores will be open on Juneteenth. Walmart and Target, for example, will be open during normal hours. It's best to check if your local businesses and restaurants are also operating during normal hours for the holiday.\n\nCNN's Harmeet Kaur contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Now, she is on a mission to make sure people understand the importance of the holiday.\n\n\"I think people on the installation should have an awareness what Juneteenth means to people outside the gates,\" she said. \"If they see a parade or different events going on and they're not from Texas, they may not have an understanding. But if we educate and give them an awareness, they know why they are celebrating this. I just feel as if we, the people on the installation and the leaders, can articulate it ourselves, it will give a better awareness to the younger people.\"\n\nAlthough Juneteenth is the oldest recognized African American-celebrated observance, it's still new to many Americans. For Ali, the shared experience of becoming more aware of the meaning behind the holiday is a chance to talk about where we've been as Americans, where we are, and where we're going.\n\n\"Learning about Juneteenth should bring up conversations to say that 'hey, this is a significant event that happened in our history and let's talk about it.' I just think that some people fear of talking about it because of the term slave. And that can cause a divisive conversation. But I would find it's a great opportunity to say, look at how far we have come. Let's just talk and truly have conversations about it. Because it is an important, important event in American history.\"\n\nThis Juneteenth, Ali hopes people will stop and reflect about why it's celebrated as they enjoy the holiday itself.\n\n\"Let us observe Juneteenth just as we observe Independence Day - as a significant turning point for freedom in our nation's history, and one where we were willing to pay a heavy price to ultimately live out our highest principles,\" she said. \"As we commemorate Juneteenth, let us embrace the opportunity to learn and empathize by recognizing the importance of this historical event.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Order No. 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 11}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 305, "textEnd": 312}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-06-", "textStart": 553, "textEnd": 560}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Buy a Day Pass or just this story using our new Digital Wallet\n\nIt took 156 years for the emancipation of enslaved people in Texas to get its due as a national holiday -- and about that long for Juneteenth to become part of the history curriculum at schools across the U.S. On the eve of what's been called America's second Independence Day, Editor JEFF D'ALESSIO asked community members: How old were you when you first learned of Juneteenth?\n\nJENIECE MITCHELL District family liaison, Urbana school district\n\n\"When I was about 26 or 27, I heard about the community-wide Juneteenth celebration. Then I started hearing about it taking place in other areas of the country and being big in Texas.\n\n\"I remember being at my parents' house and asking my mom: 'I keep hearing about Juneteenth. What exactly is that?' She explained to me that it's a celebration of freedom of the enslaved people who were still held captive until a couple years after all others had been freed across the country.\n\n\"I then asked her how was it possible that everyone was legally free and yet those demons were still able to get away with holding people against their will? I remember her saying: 'Niece, same way those same kinds of people are able to get away with the stuff they're doing to Black folks now. It's just their great grandchildren and great-great grandchildren doing it. They are able to disguise it under certain policies and procedures that protect them in their wrongdoing.'\n\n\"I grew up in a household where taking pride in your history, heritage and resilience as a Black person was taught to us early on, but this was a historical topic/event we hadn't discussed, growing up. I wanted to know, so I went online and searched for some credible articles about Juneteenth.\n\n\"I read a couple and learned that it was June 19, 1865 when this took place in Galveston, Texas. The 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution -- known to most as the Emancipation Proclamation -- had, in fact, declared all enslaved people free two years prior in 1863. Union Army troops, which enlisted a large amount of Black soldiers, made their way to plantations across the area and spread the news to the remaining people who were being unlawfully held in captivity.\n\n\"Initially, I was angered to hear of yet another instance of betrayal. I felt feelings of disgust and distrust increasing, as I was already dealing with my own instances of blatant racial discrimination in both my personal and professional life. Then, those feelings turned into a desire to make God, the ancestors and the elders of my family and community proud, as a small assurance that all they went through did not go in vain.\n\n\"I am now taking advantage of every opportunity they didn't have to make life for myself and those around me better.\"\n\nEVETTE CAMPBELLChampaign County court clerk\n\n\"I was not taught about Juneteenth in school. Even though the holiday has been celebrated for quite some time, I did not learn about Juneteenth until my late 20s.\n\n\"I am a lover of history and watch a lot of documentaries, so it wasn't until my early 30s that I took a deep dive into the significance of the date June 19, 1865.\n\n\"I think the school system does a disservice by not allowing kids to learn and think critically about cause and effects of the history of this country.\"\n\nREV. TERRANCE THOMAS Pastor, Bethel AME Church\n\n\"The first time I heard of Juneteenth was in 1994 while attending Fisk University, the premier HBCU in Nashville, Tennessee. It was in my African American History class, taught by Professor Lynda Wynn.\n\n\"I remember being amazed at the holiday and not understanding how enslaved Africans were still held in bondage after the war ended. Now it is a holiday of pride and one that I hope the Black community keeps authentic and not be co-opted by capitalism and watered-down narratives.\"\n\nLASHAUNDA CUNNINGHAMOrganizer of Saturday's 26th annual MLK Jettie Rhodes Neighborhood Day in Urbana\n\n\"Believe it or not, I first learned about Juneteenth during my first semester at Parkland College, in my late teens. My professor at the time was teaching an excerpt about Black history.\n\n\"Unbeknownst to me, it was then that I learned and realized how important this history was to and for African Americans but also disappointed that it was never taught in school. My parents were young parents who didn't begin to celebrate Black history until later in their adulthood life.\n\n\"I remember sitting in class learning about the history of Juneteenth and having 'wow' moments.\n\n\"I am ecstatic today that it is now well-known and that it is now observed as a federal holiday. It took a long time to get here and we still have quite a bit of work to do to educate about the importance of this day, as there are so many people who do not know the history nor the meaning behind Juneteenth.\n\n\"Recently, I had a discussion with a colleague who had no idea of what Juneteenth was about and was very emotional after learning about its history.\n\n\"We have more work to do.\"\n\nAUSH KNOXCo-owner, Beard Culture Barbershop & Gallery\n\n\"Honestly, I don't recall the exact time or how I found out about Juneteenth. It may have been in a documentary. My wife and I watch a lot of documentaries.\n\n\"I know that it was definitely later in life -- as an adult in my 30s. It saddens me that there is so much African American history that gets swept under the rug, because African American history is American history.\"", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com", "dataType":

After the Emancipation Proclamation, it took years before all slaves were freed in America.\n\nBecause Southern states had already seceded and war was underway, the federal government had no real power in the Confederacy until the North won the war.\n\nAfter four bloody years, the Union defeated the Confederacy to win the Civil War and abolish slavery in April 1865. There were nearly 4 million slaves in the U.S. at that time, according to U.S. census data from 1860.\n\n> WATCH: The video below, which aired in 2022, explains the history of Juneteenth:\n\nUnion armies began marching through the Southern states, freeing thousands of slaves each day. The news took months to reach Texas, which was the western most state in the Confederacy.\n\nOn June 19, 1865, Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger and 2,000 Union soldiers rode into Galveston, Texas, and told slaves of their freedom.\n\n\"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves ...\" reads the General Orders, Number 3; Headquarters District of Texas, Galveston, June 19, 1865.\n\n> WATCH: Understand the symbolism of the Juneteenth flag:\n\nGranger's words spread through Texas. All at once, slaves found out the war was over and they were free. Their joyous, spontaneous celebration gave birth to Juneteenth.\n\nJuneteenth - a combination of the words June and Nineteenth - commemorates when the last enslaved people in the South were finally set free. Many slaves were met with violence or death when they tried to leave, yet the promise of freedom extinguished fear and fueled generations of indestructible people.\n\nFormer slaves gathered on Juneteenth the next year, and the year after that, and over the decades, Black communities observe the holiday with festive family gatherings, colorful parades and bountiful barbecues.\n\nTexas became the first state to make Juneteenth an official holiday in 1980.\n\nOn June 16, 2021, a bill to make Juneteenth a federal holiday passed in the U.S. House in a 415-to-14 vote. The U.S. Senate unanimously passed it, and Biden sign the bill, making June 19 the 11th federal holiday in the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "11alive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXIA-TV 11"},

He is the co-author of Been in the Struggle: Pursuing an Antiracist Spirituality\n\nWhile Martin Luther King, Jr.'s January birthday has been a national holiday for nearly four decades, the four-year-old Juneteenth federal holiday already holds greater promise for civic education.\n\nPrecisely because a more racially contentious dynamic has unfolded around Juneteenth, this relatively recent celebration has opened the door to a focused telling of Black history. By contrast the relatively lukewarm reception to Martin Luther King Jr. Day has made education about difficult stories from our nation's past less likely. Juneteenth, on the other hand, holds more promise for honest encounters with a past often obscured by the politics of the present.\n\nUnlike the 2021 unanimous Senate vote and 415-14 House tally in favor of the Juneteenth holiday, the 1983 voting process for the King holiday was lengthy and conflictual. Having failed passage in both 1968 and 1979, the bill finally became law in 1983 but only after a Senate filibuster had been defeated and the House two-thirds majority mustered. At the state level, New Hampshire, the last state to establish a holiday to honor King by name, did not do so until 2000.\n\nPundits at the time conjectured that such a contentious legislative process would foster ongoing dissension. Contrary to this prediction, however, the celebration of the King holiday soon lost its political edge. Only a year after the first celebration of the holiday, noted civil rights historian and author Vincent Harding observed in the September 1987 edition of the Journal of American History that the country had developed \"a massive case of national amnesia\" by stripping King of his prophetic and revolutionary messages. As a result, the holiday rarely stirred new controversies.\n\nBy contrast, the establishment of Juneteenth as a federal holiday in 2021 offered a rare moment of bi-partisan support for racially conscious legislation. But the subsequent record of Juneteenth celebrations has been far more mixed. To be certain, this new holiday has popularized the Juneteenth history. The delay in announcing an end to slavery to the quarter million enslaved people in Texas is now much more widely known. Where once the account of the army's arrival in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, rarely circulated outside African-American circles, the narrative is now told on an annual basis in thousands of celebrations across the country.\n\nAt the same time, tensions around Juneteenth celebrations have increased in the wake of the initial bi-partisan consensus. Since January 2021, 44 states have introduced bills placing limits on the teaching of Critical Race Theory (CRT), often with chilling effect on all public discussions of race-specific history. As of 2023, 28 states have enacted restrictions and bans on CRT and related topics through legislative mandate, executive order, or other means. These legislative developments have, in turn, politicized Juneteenth as public celebrations of the day become a rare occasion for instruction in Black history.\n\nAmid these racial tensions, the historically specific nature of the holiday made a softening of the story less likely. The life of an individual -- even one tragically cut short like MLK Jr.'s -- offers many angles for re-interpretation. The story of the failure to inform an enslaved people of their freedom has proven far more difficult to recast.\n\nRead More: The Origins of Juneteenth and Why 'Black Independence Day' Falls on June 19th\n\nHistorians have long argued that the practice of democracy requires not only a civically educated populace but a body politic knowledgeable about its successes and failures. If the way forward for U.S. democracy involves such literacy, Juneteenth celebrations -- more so than the now blunted King holiday -- appear to be an incubator for what that racially conscious literacy might entail.\n\nIn the small Mountain West city of Missoula, Montana where I live, for instance, the Montana Black Collective Missoula organizes an annual Juneteenth celebration at which leaders from the city and county join community residents to learn not only about the events of Juneteenth in Texas but the history of African Americans in their city and state. Past celebrations have included talks about the famed sojourns of the 25-infantry bicycle corps, the history of Ku Klux Klan's visit to a local African Methodist Episcopal Church in Missoula, and the legacies of notable Black Montanans -- women, men, and children. The platform for educating the public about Montana's Black History has broadened significantly due to the educational and celebratory activities provided by the Juneteenth holiday.\n\nWhenever such local celebrations take place, they model the possibilities that emerge from robust telling of our nation's often fraught, frequently horrific, and yet hope-filled history. That story offers an invitation to strengthen the body politic and to honor the forebears who, like those who marched into the full awareness of their freedom in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, took risks and helped bring about a fuller realization of what democracy could mean and might one day become. The King holiday can and should continue to be celebrated as a point of national unity around a fallen hero, of course. But the ongoing celebration of Juneteenth holds even greater promise for robust civic education precisely because it acknowledges a point of such historic tension.", "source": {"uri": "time.com",

The award-winning Harvard historian presents an intimate portrait of the experiences of her family and her memories of life as an African American girl growing up in segregated Texas. The essays in her book invite readers to enter a world shaped by the forces of freedom and slavery.\n\nReed's exploration of the history and legacy of Juneteenth is a poignant reminder of the hard history all Americans face.\n\nWilliam H. Wiggins Jr.'s \"O Freedom! Afro-American Emancipation Celebrations\" is the historical standard for African American emancipation celebrations. It offers an accessible and well-researched account of the emergence and evolution of Juneteenth.\n\nGet stories like these delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up for The 74 Newsletter\n\nWiggins brings together oral history with archival research to share the stories of how African Americans celebrated emancipation. It explains how Juneteenth is part of the tapestry of emancipation celebrations. These celebrations included such dates as January 1, in North Carolina, April 3, in Richmond, Virginia, and April 16, in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat began as a local holiday has evolved into a national celebration.\n\nJuneteenth celebrations are known for the variety of programs and events that highlight African American history and culture. In the 1960s, students at Prairie View A&M University in Prairie View, Texas, informed faculty that classes would not be held on Juneteenth. In Milwaukee, the local Juneteenth parade includes a group known as the Black Cowboys riding their horses along Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. Juneteenth celebrations also feature cultural fairs and exhibitions, artistic performances and historical reenactments. Lectures and public conversations, community feasts and religious services are also part of the celebrations.\n\nRalph Ellison, perhaps best known for his novel \"Invisible Man,\" offers multiple meanings of Juneteenth in African American and American life in his posthumously published novel \"Juneteenth.\"\n\nThe ambivalence of Juneteenth is of a freedom delayed but not denied. Ellison's spiraling novel captures this in the entangled and tragic lives of the racist Senator Sunraider - previously known as Bliss - and the minister who raised him, the Reverend A. Z. Hickman. For Ellison, Juneteenth represents more than just a celebration of emancipation. It also represents the shared fate of white Americans and African Americans in the quest to create a just and equal society. The promise and peril of Juneteenth is elegantly captured in Hickman's words, \"There's been a heap of Juneteenths before this one and I tell you there'll be a heap more before we're truly free!\"\n\nMitch Kachun's book, \"Festivals of Freedom: Memory and Meaning in African American Emancipation Celebrations, 1808-1915,\" traces the history of emancipation celebrations and their influence on African American identity and community. Juneteenth joined a longer tradition of emancipation celebrations. Those celebrations included ones at the end of the trans-Atlantic slave trade in the United States on Jan. 1, 1808. They also included the August First Day/West India Day celebrations that marked the abolition of slavery throughout the British Empire on Aug. 1, 1834.\n\nWith an eye for historical detail, Kachun narrates a complex history of how Juneteenth and other freedom festivals shaped African American identity and political culture. The celebrations also displayed competing meanings of African American identity. In Washington, D.C. in the late 19th century, different groups of African Americans held distinct celebrations. These variations underscored tensions around political ideals, status and identity. Kachun's book reminds us that Juneteenth served as a crucible for forging a collective and contested sense of African American community.\n\nSimilar to Kachun's book, Howard University historian Jeffrey R. Kerr-Ritchie's \"Rites of August First: Emancipation Day in the Black Atlantic World\" reminds readers of a broader history and geography of emancipation celebrations.\n\nKerr-Ritchie focuses on how various African American communities adopted and adapted West India Day celebrations. He also explores how they created meaning and culture in celebrating the abolition of slavery in the British West Indies. Kerr-Ritchie's book details how these celebrations moved across political borders and boundaries.\n\nContemporary invocations of Juneteenth often overlook its military history.\n\nEdward T. Cotham, Jr.'s \"Juneteenth: The Story Behind the Celebration\" fills the void by exploring the Civil War origins of Juneteenth.\n\nCotham renders explicit the military context leading up to the events on June 19, 1865, in Galveston. This is when enslaved Black people there finally got word that they had been freed more than two years prior. Cotham reminds readers that the history of Juneteenth involves ordinary actions of many individual people whose names may not be widely known.\n\nCollectively, these books about Juneteenth offer fresh perspectives on the history and culture of African Americans on a quest to fully express their freedom. Juneteenth is also an invitation for all Americans to continue to learn about and strive for freedom for all people.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

We have to celebrate it on that day, and we do it because we love our community. We want people to learn what this day is all about.\"\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday commemorates the formal end of slavery after the Civil War, when the last enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas were notified of their freedom on June 19, 1865 -- more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863.\n\nShropshire said he hopes to commemorate the day through art and music - Wednesday's \"Love4Us Freedom Day Celebration\" will include live performances, DJs and a special retelling of origin of the Civil Rights Movement's \"battle cry\" anthem, \"We Shall Overcome.\"\n\nShropshire said that his now-deceased grandmother, Louise Shropshire, was an activist and musician who worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and helped write the lyrical foundations of what became the song \"We Shall Overcome.\" Though Louise Shropshire was not initially known to the public, her grandson said the struggle for her recognition, and for the song to be in the public domain, is a reminder for Black people to dig into their history. And that's the message he hopes everyone will take away during Juneteenth.\n\n\"These are things we should know about as Black people. Our intellectual property, things that were stolen from us... but this was one thing we were able to take back,\" Shropshire said. \"During those days of slavery, our people were damaged, and that damage would carry on over generations and generations. So we have the responsibility of correcting that damage, especially within our community.\"\n\nJuneteenth Freedom Day attendees in San Bernardino will be able to learn history, engage in community activities and support Black-owned businesses; all while keeping the true message of Juneteenth alive, he said.\n\n\"The most important word in there is 'Freedom.' Are we free yet? Not completely - there's still work that we need to do. And that's what I hope people will take away, that our ancestors started, lived and died for freedom. But they also left work for us to do,\" Shropshire said. \"The only way we can is to rally together as Black people, leaving out everything that divides us outside of that; rally around the love. That's what got us this far.\"\n\nThree years after becoming a federal holiday, Juneteenth is honored across the nation and in Southern California with local celebrations, arts and music-filled festivals, lively cook-outs, wellness workshops and more.\n\nFrom a jazz and arts festival in Pomona to city-wide celebrations in Long Beach, Buena Park, Pasadena and Redlands, recent and upcoming Juneteenth events across the region promise to highlight and uplift Black culture.\n\nBut despite the holiday's celebratory nature - and a day off of work in the middle of the week this year - Juneteenth also reminds people of a more serious matter: That freedom is not free, organizers emphasize.\n\n\"Looking back at our legacy, our heritage, how far we've come, and so much work that we have to do today to continue moving forward as a community. The reality of Juneteenth is American history,\" said Inglewood resident Alfred Torregano, director of the annual Leimert Park Juneteenth Festival. \"It's equivalent to the Independence Day of the African American.\"\n\nThis year's Juneteenth is a bit \"bittersweet\" for his community, Torregano said. Officials had to postpone the longtime community event to 2025 due to financial constraints and safety concerns. But the South L.A. neighborhood will still be celebrating locally through sharing food, supporting Black businesses, live music and coming together, he said.\n\nFor El Segundo resident Tanya Taylor, Juneteenth is an ongoing celebration. Taylor, the executive director of nonprofit Black in Mayberry, spends weeks getting ready for community events - including a festival already held in El Segundo, Manhattan Beach's June 19 ceremony, and a Juneteenth-themed exhibition and artists' panel at the Experimentally Structured Museum of Art in Venice Beach.\n\nThe Black in Mayberry Juneteenth art exhibit, now open through June 23, explores modern-day slavery through topics such as over-policing and prison labor, asking questions such as \"Are we free yet?\"\n\nDifferent mediums of art can open the door for Black Americans to process heavy topics of racism and slavery through and with the community, which can \"maintain freedom\" and be a source of joy, Taylor said.\n\n\"We acknowledge all the contributions that have been made by African American people to the fabric of America... by demonstrating Black excellence in the arts,\" Taylor said. \"Freedom is a right we all deserve as human beings. But we have to fight for it, and the freedoms of many people in America had to be fought for. People underestimate how quickly things can backflip or reverse.\"\n\nLos Angeles resident and author Anita Obasi is organizing a June 19 and June Pride Month-centric event through the group Sapphic L.A. She said that Black people have been celebrating Juneteenth for years before it was federally recognized - but now that more people have the day off, it helps to \"widen the audience of celebration.\"\n\nSociety is in \"an early stage\" where \"we can carve out what this (Juneteenth) holiday means and how we celebrate,\" Obasi said. She plans to do so by intentionally releasing a \"Sapphic L.A. city guide\" to queer-friendly spaces in L.A. on Juneteenth - the \"Blackest day of the year in the queerest month of the year\" - at Sip & Sonder in Inglewood.\n\n\"That intersection of being Black and queer is extremely important to me, because it is me,\" Obasi said. \"Intersectionality is something that I feel often goes overlooked when discussing queer or Black experiences. How can we put at the forefront the importance of being aware of intersectionality? For me, that looks like handing out pre-orders at a coffee shop that is also Black female-owned.\"\n\nOrange County Heritage Council President Dwayne Shipp -- whose mother Helen Shipp founded the county's longtime Black History Month parade -- is one of the organizers behind a Juneteenth festival celebrated over the weekend in Anaheim's Pearson Park. With the theme \"Freedom is Not Free,\" it was one of the biggest Juneteenth events in Orange County, Shipp said.\n\n\"Juneteenth highlights the rich culture and contributions of the Black community, while educating our neighbors through history and bridging the gap through a collective celebration... which is especially crucial in a diverse region like O.C.,\" Shipp said. \"We are celebrating a 'turning point' in American, not just Black, history. It fosters a sense of solidarity (and) encourages ongoing dialogue about African American injustice. Its impact extends beyond a single day or event -- but is a reminder of our shared responsibility, continuing the inclusive work to our society, honoring the past while inspiring the future.\"\n\nBIPOC Orange County and the city of Irvine are teaming up again to host a growing celebration of Juneteenth on Saturday, June 22, at the Irvine Great Park. The afternoon will feature music and dance as well as poetry readings and other live performances. There will be art displays and more from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nKayla Booker, founder of The B.L.A.C.K. Collective nonprofit, was recently honored to have her now four-year-old Juneteenth festival in Riverside recognized by Assemblymember Sabrina Cervantes, D-Riverside.\n\nShe argued that Black history is not taught exclusively in schools - so these events are important to support.\n\n\"Just like people celebrate the Fourth of July, this is our freedom day. It's the day for our community to rejoice, that our ancestors were finally able to leave behind slavery, to connect with their families, to move and find opportunity,\" Booker said. \"It's important for generations to know our community's resilience, the activism Black people have today. Even if we are still going through rough times, we can make it through because our ancestors (did).\"", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"},

(You'll note it is not Jan. 1, the date of President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. More on that below.) From its celebratory roots in churches across Texas to the impassioned protests of the last year, Juneteenth has come a long way with finally being recognized as an official holiday, and even retailers like Amazon have recognized Black-Owned Businesses.\n\nAfter a unanimous vote, the House passed legislation that establishes June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day, with President Joe Biden signing the bill into law on June 17, 2021, recognizing Juneteenth as an official federal holiday.\n\nThat year's Juneteenth received high-profile recognition via Juneteenth: Together We Triumph - A 'Soul of a Nation' Special Event, which aired on ABC and was hosted by Leslie Odom Jr. The special included performances by Jimmie Allen, Chl\u00f6e Bailey (of Chloe x Halle) and Leon Bridges.\n\nIn 2022, CNN exclusively broadcasted Juneteenth: A Global Celebration for Freedom featuring appearances by Yolanda Adams, Billy Porter, Jhene Aiko, Earth, Wind & Fire and more. Along with a series of specials, shows and performances, this year's Juneteenth National Independence Day will see a return to in-person celebrations that were put on pause due to the pandemic. But more than a century after the final enslaved people were freed, too many still don't know why celebrating June 19 is important -- and why America still has much to grapple with its legacy.\n\nLincoln's Emancipation Proclamation went into effect Jan. 1, 1863, declaring \"all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State... shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.\" It wouldn't be until two and a half years later, on June 19, 1865, that General Gordon Granger and his Union soldiers arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War had ended and any enslaved people were freed by executive order.\n\n\"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor,\" Granger's proclamation read. \"The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.\"\n\nIn addition to Juneteenth making its mark for the first time as an official U.S. holiday, 2021 marked the 100th anniversary of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre -- one of the single worst acts of racial violence in history which took place on May 31 and June 1, 1921 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Several documentaries were released in 2021 to mark the occasion, including Tulsa Burning: The 1921 Race Massacre, executive produced by NBA star Russell Westbrook and directed by Emmy-winning filmmaker Stanley Nelson and Peabody Award winner Marco Williams. The documentary focuses on a specific period, from the birth of Black Wall Street to its catastrophic downfall over two bloody days and then the fallout and eventual reconstruction.\n\nSeveral other podcasts and docuseries premiered that same year, including the six-part podcast series Blindspot: Tulsa Burning, Rise Again: Tulsa and the Red Summer on National Geographic and Tulsa: The Fire and the Forgotten on PBS.\n\nThrough Black-ish and #blackAF, Kenya Barris has put the Black experience at the center of two modern family comedies. In Black-ish's season 4 premiere, \"Juneteenth,\" Barris took inspiration from the hit Broadway musical Hamilton to shine a light on the lack of Black holidays. \"There's no holds barred here. We are full-on Broadway-ing it,\" star Tracee Ellis Ross told ET.\n\nThree years later, Juneteenth appears in #blackAF, which doubles down on the ideas he presented on Black-ish by offering a brief history lesson on the date's significance and showing how Barris' onscreen family gathers in honor of June 19.\n\n\"Juneteenth,\" Atlanta (FX)\n\nCreated by and starring Donald Glover, the acclaimed FX comedy blends surreal humor with stark reality to hold a mirror up to the human condition. Season 1 episode \"Juneteenth\" (written by Stefani Robinson and directed by Janicza Bravo) sees Earn (Glover) and Vanessa (Zazie Beetz) attend a pretentious Juneteenth-themed party thrown by an affluent biracial couple, where the cocktail list includes drinks like Frozen Freedom Margarita and Plantation Master Poison.\n\nJuneteenth Jamboree (PBS)\n\nJuneteenth Jamboree is an ongoing PBS series that examines the holiday's significance in Black culture. Each 30-minute episode delves into various elements that have influenced Juneteenth over its 100-plus-year history, including Texas' own African American heritage, the heroes who emerged from it and life on the frontier following the Civil War.\n\n\"Freedom,\" High on the Hog (Netflix)\n\nThe Netflix series follows food writer Stephen Satterfield as he traces the origins of African-American cuisine through its lines from Africa to Texas. Titled \"Freedom,\" the episode celebrates Juneteenth and takes viewers to Texas where it all started.\n\nWriter-director Channing Godfrey Peoples drew on her own childhood in Galveston to shape the world of Miss Juneteenth, about former pageant queen turned single mom Turquoise (Nicole Beharie) as she struggles to make ends meet and uplift her daughter to fulfill her dream deferred.\n\n\"The story is largely about a woman, a family, trying to survive and figure out how they're going to relate to each other,\" Beharie told ET about the film, which debuted on demand on June 19, 2020. \"It's about the future, and it's about the community and the values that they have and who is valued and who isn't. What are the codes of conduct? Who gets discarded and why?\"\n\nThe Invisible Man author's second novel was published in 1999, five years after his death. Set in the 1950s, Juneteenth tells the story of a race-baiting senator, Adam Sunraider, who recalls his childhood spent with a Black con man turned reverend who took him in and raised him in the church. The celebration of Juneteenth, it turns out, marked Sunraider's initial departure point both physically and spiritually -- he dismissed it as \"the celebration of a gaudy illusion\" -- but all these years later, does he regret leaving it behind?\n\nJuneteenth is widely celebrated with events where people share good food while discussing the future of the community. With social distancing mandates and other restrictions having been lifted across the country in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's festivities mark a true return to festivals and celebrations taking place in person in cities around the country including San Antonio, Las Vegas, Chicago and many more.\n\nBut if you're hesitant about getting out there or getting together with friends and family is not an option, there are a number of ways to honor Juneteenth this year, including via donation to a nonprofit such as the African American Cultural Heritage Action Fund or The Bail Project, as well as to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the ACLU.", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [],

In 2016, she walked 1,400 miles from Fort Worth to Washington to bring awareness to the celebration and initiated an online petition in hopes of gaining support from Congress to officially name Juneteenth a federal holiday.\n\nNow, five years after she launched her campaign, Juneteenth has become the first federal holiday signed into law since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983.\n\n\"You're going to see me dancing in the street,\" Lee said during a Wednesday presentation at Harvard University. \"I'm so happy I don't know what to do.\"\n\nLee was present at the White House on Thursday during the bill signing, where she was given an ovation and stood by the president and members of Congress as the bill became law. President Biden said Lee was an incredible woman and praised what he called a single-minded goal to have Juneteenth become a federal holiday.\n\n\"She's made it her mission to see that this day came,\" he said. \"She's walked for miles and miles, literally and figuratively, to bring attention to Juneteenth, to make this day possible.\"\n\nJuneteenth celebrates the June 19, 1865, announcement of General Order No. 3, which proclaimed the freedom of slaves in Texas, almost two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nThe Juneteenth celebration, which originated in Galveston as early as 1866, has brought families and communities together for decades to celebrate freedom and educate people about the struggles and triumphs of Black Americans.\n\nFor Lee, Juneteenth is also the day in 1939 a white mob burned her childhood home on East Annie Street because her family had integrated into the white neighborhood.\n\nCampaigns to bring national recognition to Juneteenth have been ongoing for several years, and Texas lawmakers, including Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican, and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, have pushed Juneteeth legislation in Congress in the past.\n\nCornyn and fellow Republican Sen. Ted Cruz co-sponsored the recent Senate bill.\n\nCornyn said there's no better time than the present to recognize the history associated with the holiday in order to make progress with issues such as the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\n\n\"Acknowledging and learning from the mistakes of the past is critical to making that progress and becoming a more perfect union,\" he said during a press conference.\n\nJackson Lee sponsored the House bill and 12 Texas representatives co-sponsored, including U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth.\n\nVeasey said this milestone would not be possible without Opal Lee's work.\n\n\"Now, we must build on this important step forward -- and Ms. Lee's work -- by recommitting ourselves to the ongoing work of guaranteeing liberty and equal rights for all Americans,\" he said in a press release.\n\nLee will continue with her now-annual Juneteenth walk on Saturday morning, when she will walk 2.5 miles beginning at Evans Avenue Plaza in the Historic Southside and ending at the Tarrant County Courthouse in downtown Fort Worth. The 2.5 miles symbolize the two and a half years it took for slaves in Texas to realize they had been freed.\n\nBecause June 19 will fall on a Saturday, the federal government will observe the holiday on Friday with the closure of most government offices.\n\nAt the bill signing, President Biden said despite this progress, the fight for equality continues by combating racial discrimination and inequity.\n\n\"It's simply not enough just to commemorate Juneteenth,\" he said. \"After all, the emancipation of enslaved Black Americans didn't mark the end of America's work to deliver on the promise of equality. It only marked the beginning. To honor the true meaning of Juneteeth, we have to continue towards that promise, because we have not gotten there yet.\"\n\nBefore landing on Biden's desk, the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act bill passed unanimously through the Senate and passed through the House in a 415-14 vote. The \"no\" votes included Reps. Chip Roy and Ronny Jackson of Texas.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, as time passed and I had conversations with my white friends who had no idea about its historical origins, I started realizing the true importance of Juneteenth. It is not just another holiday, but a valuable lesson for America -- a chance to confront its past and make amends for ongoing injustices.\n\nJuneteenth is a day that marks the liberation of enslaved African Americans in Texas. Can you believe it took more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation for them to learn they were finally free? This delay speaks volumes about the deep-seated oppression that persisted even after slavery was abolished on paper. This also exemplifies the deep-seated oppression that continues at present where Black people are seen as a threat simply for existing in a white or non-Black space.\n\nThe fact that many people, including well-meaning white Americans, are unaware of Juneteenth's significance highlights the need for education and reflection. This holiday forces us to confront uncomfortable truths about America's treatment of Black people. It shows us that, despite viewing itself as exceptional, America has fallen short of its own ideals. Juneteenth offers an opportunity for the nation to acknowledge its past transgressions and develop a deeper understanding of the pain and struggles endured by the Black community.\n\nIn today's climate, where some histories are ignored while others are selectively maintained, Juneteenth takes on even greater significance. It serves as a powerful reminder that we must face the uncomfortable aspects of our past to heal and move forward. By recognizing Juneteenth, we can foster empathy and understanding, laying the groundwork for a more inclusive society.\n\nBut it doesn't stop at acknowledgment alone. Juneteenth represents a turning point -- a call to action. It demands that we address the ongoing systemic disparities and inequalities faced by Black people in America. This holiday pushes us to confront the uncomfortable truth and work towards reparations and a genuine apology for the harms inflicted upon the Black community. While legislative measures are essential, Juneteenth galvanizes us to take a more comprehensive approach to repairing the damages of systemic racism.\n\nAs someone who has been raised in both Africa and America, I have witnessed Africans ignore the plight of African Americans due to the misinformation they received about them via the American media. This holiday has broader global ramifications and educational impact that I previously ignored. Now the rest of the world has an opportunity to learn the often hidden history of African American people. The next step would be a true acknowledgment of the contributions and reparations, but we are getting closer than I thought.\n\nUltimately, Juneteenth serves as a reminder to our Black brothers and sisters in America that their pain is seen and acknowledged. That is a huge step towards healing and says that as a nation, any of our citizens' struggles are all of our struggles. It offers us yet another opportunity to unite around a common struggle to defeat racism and sends a message of solidarity.\n\nIn conclusion, Juneteenth goes beyond being just a holiday. It symbolizes America's potential for growth, accountability, and unity. By embracing this historical milestone, we can create a society that values the acknowledgment of past injustices and actively seeks to rectify them. Juneteenth urges us to confront the uncomfortable realities of systemic racism and commit to change. It offers us a future where every individual is treated with dignity and equality. Let us remember the pain and suffering endured by the Black community, ensuring that history is not forgotten or repeated. Juneteenth is an invitation for America to fulfill its promise and live up to its ideals. It is an opportunity for me to share the dignity and importance of struggle with my young son who knows nothing about this history. It gives me an opportunity to see struggle as something worthy versus something to look down on. Perhaps other Americans will begin to see this history the same way and join the struggle for full freedom and equality for all.

Since these recognitions, celebrations have grown across the state.\n\nNumerous Juneteenth celebrations were held across the state over the weekend with more to come throughout the week and into the coming weekend.\n\nThis is the second year Juneteenth has been recognized as a state holiday and the fourth year since it was recognized federally. So, for some, the holiday is relatively new.\n\nIt's particularly important as Juneteenth celebrations grow and more people celebrate, to \"remember the why,\" said Shemeka Bogan with Strong Roots Foundation, a group that helped sponsor the Northside Juneteenth Celebration.\n\n\"This is really a learning experience for a lot of people,\" Bogan said.\n\nJuneteenth marks the day more than 250,000 Black people were freed in the state of Texas by executive decree. Though the Emancipation Proclamation was made effective in 1863, this mass freedom was not won until June 19, 1865 when Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas.\n\n\"We don't look at it as just like, 'OK, it's just a Black holiday, only Black people can celebrate it,'\" Bogan said. \"We want white people to celebrate it. We want our Latino brothers and sisters to celebrate it. We want everybody to celebrate with us and understand why it's an important holiday for us.\"\n\nThe past weekend's Northside Juneteenth Celebration started with a free movie screening at the Capri Theater Friday night. On Saturday, a family festival was held on the Lyndale block of West Broadway Avenue and an ice cream social at North Commons Pool Sunday. The goal of the week is to celebrate community, culture and creativity in the Black community, Bogan said.\n\n\"You have youth groups that are able to come out and showcase their talents and understand why they're doing that,\" she said. \"We have art projects that are reflective of different cultures. We have storytelling where our elders are coming in and just telling the history and the stories behind Juneteenth. You forget how far they have come over the years and the different things that they've seen. It's one thing to read something from a history book, but it's another thing to hear it directly from someone else who is a trusted community member.\"\n\nIn its second year as a state holiday, Bogan said she feels like Juneteenth celebrations have tripled in the state with many Minnesota cities launching their own Juneteenth celebrations.\n\n\"It's not just in Minneapolis,\" Bogan said. \"It's just been really awesome to see different communities express themselves. It's really nice to have so many events that are welcoming of all cultures in celebration of Black culture.\"\n\nIn 2021, the bill to make Juneteenth a national holiday led by Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn, was signed into law by President Joe Biden. During the Saturday Northside Juneteenth Family Festival, Smith told the story about how this law came to be.\n\nIt started with Opal Lee, a woman born in Fort Worth, Texas in 1928. When Lee was 12 years old, her house was burned down by white rioters who were trying to drive her and her family out of town, Smith said.\n\n\"But she didn't give up. She was resilient. She became a teacher and when she retired, she became an organizer and an activist,\" Smith said.\n\nLee became one of the strongest advocates for Juneteenth to become a federal holiday and she delivered millions of petitions to Washington, DC. That's when Smith met Lee.\n\n\"She came to me and she talked to me about the importance of this and she said, 'Tina, what are you going to do to make sure that Juneteenth becomes a holiday that we all can celebrate together?' Miss Lee is not easy to say no to. She's a feisty grandmother. I believe there are a few feisty grandmothers in this crowd today,\" Smith said to the crowd at the event with her words met by nods of agreement.\n\nWhen Kamala Harris became Vice President of the United States, she brought the bill to Smith who said she helped carry it over the finish line.\n\n\"It was one of the most meaningful things that I've had a chance to be a part of,\" Smith said. \"This story is about the story of power and activism and people working and never giving up. And that is also the story of the north side of Minneapolis.\"", "source": {"uri": "minnpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MinnPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "winter_keefer@minnpost.com", "name": "Winter Keefer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tina_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tina Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African-American culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Celebrity_Memorabilia", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Celebrity Memorabilia", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Religion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Religion", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/JuneteenthSInger940.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 1020, "textEnd": 1027}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

It was rather specific, designating which counties and parishes the proclamation would cover. \"I do order and declare that all persons held as slaves within said designated States, and parts of States, are, and henceforward shall be free,\" Lincoln wrote. Elsewhere in the proclamation, the president made it clear that non-Union Confederate states were the areas being targeted. That included Louisiana, but 13 parishes were exempt from the proclamation: Ascension, Assumption, Jefferson, Lafourche, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. John, St. Mary, St. Martin, Terrebonne, and \"Orleans, including the City of New Orleans.\"\n\nSlavery was not fully abolished until the 13th Amendment was passed by Congress on Jan. 31, 1865, then ratified on Dec. 6, 1865. Still, Lincoln's proclamation sent an important signal, albeit one that was slow to spread.\n\nThere was no nightly news, no internet and certainly no social media to quickly and widely share the breaking news that the Emancipation Proclamation had been signed and slavery had ended.\n\nIt took more than two years -- until June 19, 1865 -- for enslaved people in Galveston Bay to learn that they were among the 250,000 in Texas and 4 million nationally who were freed by order of the president.\n\nEnslaved people who were freed celebrated, starting a Texas tradition that eventually spread to other states across the nation. \"June\" and \"19th\" were combined to create \"Juneteenth.\"\n\nIn 2021, President Joe Biden made Juneteenth a federal holiday and Louisiana made it a state holiday. Today Juneteenth is recognized as a holiday, observance or remembrance in all 50 states and Washington, D.C.\n\nThere's been some confusion about Juneteenth this year because June 19 falls on a Wednesday. Traditionally, Juneteenth has been observed on the third Saturday of June, making it possible for more people to celebrate while off from work. The federal holiday is June 19. Last month, Gov. Jeff Landry designated June 19 as the official state holiday. Federal, state and local offices will be closed, as will most banks.\n\nOpal Lee, recognized as the grandmother of Juneteenth because she started a national effort to create the federal holiday when she was 86 years old, grew up less than an hour away from Shreveport in Marshall, Texas, before moving to the Fort Worth area.\n\n\"Juneteenth means freedom, and I mean for everybody,\" Lee told CBS News in 2022.\n\nWe agree, and urge everybody to celebrate the holiday -- and to honor and safeguard the freedoms that were, for many Americans, much too belatedly won.", "source": {"uri": "nola.com",

No matter what ideals they may have claimed to believe in, America's founders created a system of governance that valued the economic interests of America's wealthy landowners more than the basic human and civil rights of millions of enslaved Black Americans.\n\nEmbracing slavery was an intentional decision by the founders, debated openly at the constitutional convention and in numerous letters and other documents. Some of them even acknowledged that slavery violated the most basic ideals of American liberty.\n\nHowever, their commitment to property rights, philosophies of limited government and desire to build consensus with the other delegates to the convention - nearly half of whom owned slaves - led to a shameful compromise that condemned Blacks, and some Native Americans, to continued slavery.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln took the first step toward undoing America's original sin in 1863, when he issued the Emancipation Proclamation and legally ended slavery in the United States. While enslaved people in Southern states were almost certainly aware of the Emancipation Proclamation, it couldn't be enforced in the South until the Confederacy surrendered to end the Civil War.\n\nWord traveled slowly in those days, especially in the West.\n\nOn June 19, 1865, Union General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, and announced General Order No. 3, which proclaimed the freedom of all enslaved people in Texas, and the official end of slavery in the United States.\n\nOne year later, freedmen and women organized the first annual \"Jubilee Day\" on June 19, 1866. This tradition spread across Texas and eventually to other states as African Americans migrated throughout the country. The celebrations often included readings of the Emancipation Proclamation, religious ceremonies and the singing of spirituals, embedding the day with cultural and historical significance.\n\nToday, millions of Americans celebrate Juneteenth.\n\nWhile the end of slavery is certainly a milestone that is worthy of celebration, it is important to remember that declaring freedom for Black people did not make them free.\n\nThe end of a legal system that commodified Black human beings and treated them as property marked the beginning of a new legal system that treated Black human beings as enemy combatants in a society that created, in essence, a different economy and different rights for white people and people of color. While 1865 marked a significant step forward for the U.S. legal system, it would be another century before society joined in taking even a baby step on the march toward freedom and equality for Black Americans.\n\nThat march continues today.\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office, the Justice Department has brought redlining lawsuits against more than a dozen banks and insurance providers, accusing them of denying mortgage, lending and insurance to non-white homeowners and prospective homeowners based on their race and the area where they seek to reside. Social media platforms like Facebook have been charged with allowing landlords and real estate agents to systemically exclude minorities from seeing ads for housing in certain affluent and predominantly white neighborhoods and communities. And just last year, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down congressional district maps in Alabama on the basis of blatant racial gerrymandering.\n\nEven Juneteenth itself was not recognized as a national holiday until the 2020 murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and other Black Americans thrust issues of racial justice into the spotlight.\n\nWhile the nation struggled with the horror of those deaths, which amid this backdrop of heightened awareness of the historical and ongoing struggles faced by African Americans, the anguish fueled a decades-long campaign led by retired teacher, counselor and activist Opal Lee to recognize Juneteenth as a national holiday.This led to a bipartisan effort in the U.S. Congress to officially recognize Juneteenth as a federal holiday. On June 17, 2021, Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act into law, making it the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established in 1983.\n\nJuneteenth serves as a powerful reminder of the gaps that exist between American ideals and our shortcomings. It prompts reflection on the past, present and future, acknowledging the atrocities of slavery, the heroism of those who fought for freedom and the struggles that continue today. It is as much a celebration of progress made as a call to action to address the systemic inequalities that continue today.\n\nMoreover, Juneteenth encourages a broader dialogue about what freedom and equality truly mean in contemporary society. It challenges individuals and institutions to consider how the legacies of slavery and discrimination shape present-day policies and attitudes. Consider for a moment, how the economics of Black Americans might look different had they been allowed to earn and invest wages, purchase and pass down homes and property or been protected from predatory banking practices from the founding of our republic.\n\nIn other words, Juneteenth is more than just a recognition of a historical milestone of the past; it is a vibrant, living tradition that should challenge us to advocate for change moving forward.\n\nWe encourage all Las Vegans to participate in Juneteenth activities, celebrating progress made and reflecting on work yet to be done.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki",

They both proclaimed an end to slavery and provided the muscle to back up the proclamation. In Texas, freedom had been a long time coming.\n\nA year later, Black Texans began to mark the date with Juneteenth celebrations. The unofficial holiday came to recognize African American culture and each generation's sacrifice and contributions toward making America live up to its promise. Because of that work, we Americans have formed a more perfect union -- one that recognizes our country's diversity as its strength.\n\nBut official nationwide recognition of Juneteenth, like freedom, was a long time coming.\n\nTexas became the first state to recognize Juneteenth as a state holiday. The late state Rep. Al Edwards introduced the legislation here in 1979.\n\nMy work to establish a Juneteenth federal holiday began in 2013, when in Congress, I introduced my first Juneteenth Resolution to recognize the day's historic significance. I continued to introduce a resolution each year.\n\nMORE FROM OPINION: Why we Black Americans celebrate Juneteenth outdoors, on public land\n\nThen, in 2020, the world witnessed George Floyd gasping for help while a Minneapolis police officer suffocated him with his knee for nearly nine minutes. Shortly afterward, streets across the nation filled with marches.\n\nI could feel the same emotion and response in the halls of Congress. It was apparent when I sent out a \"Dear Colleague\" seeking support from my fellow members of Congress to join as cosponsors of my Juneteenth Resolution. It was introduced on June 15, 2020, with over 200 original sponsors, and reached a total of 214 bipartisan cosponsors before being adopted by the House of Representatives on June 30.\n\nThat recognition of the day's significance was a solid start, and I knew the time had arrived for Juneteenth to become a full-fledged federal holiday. I tasked my policy director, Lillie Coney, to have that bill drafted for introduction, and I sent another \"Dear Colleague\" letter to my colleagues in the House.\n\nWe ran into technical trouble. When I first introduced the bill, the House parliamentarian blocked its enrollment or listing as a House Bill. My bill had specified June 19 as the date for Juneteenth. When else, after all, would you celebrate a holiday named \"Juneteenth?\"\n\nBut House procedural rules regarding federal holidays prohibit naming specific dates. So we removed \"June 19\" from the House bill, and I introduced the revised bill, H.R. 7232, on June 18, 2020. The Congressional Research Service told my staff that it was the first bill ever introduced in the history of the House or Senate that aimed to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday.\n\nREAD ALSO: New to Juneteenth? Know the history before you celebrate.\n\nFollowing the introduction of H.R. 7232, Senator Ed Markey's staff reached out to collaborate. Markey introduced the Senate version of my bill with only one difference: The Senate version included the date June 19. No rule in the Senate prohibited specifying the date.\n\nFor the first time, both the House and the Senate adopted their respective Juneteenth resolutions. But the 116th Congress ended without the act being passed.\n\nSo in 2021, in the 117th Congress, Sen. Markey and I simultaneously introduced Juneteenth bills in the House and Senate.\n\nThe House did not advance H.R. 1320. But if the companion bill, S. 475, passed in the Senate, it would come back to the House for a vote, so my efforts shifted toward getting allies in the Senate to pass that version. My long-time Juneteenth partner, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, joined this effort wholeheartedly and became the lead Republican sponsor of the Markey bill.\n\nWe could count on only the votes of the bill's 54 cosponsors, and in the Senate, if fewer than 60 Senators do not agree to a vote on a bill, it will not proceed. We needed six more senators.\n\nWe picked up three cosponsors in March, and two more in May.\n\nThen, on June 8, my dear friend Sen. Raphael G. Warnock of Georgia became the 60th senator to sign on. Sen. Warnock is the senior pastor at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, the former pulpit of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Nearly 30 years after the Martin Luther King, Jr., federal holiday was established, it was poetic that Sen. Warnock was the deciding factor for Juneteenth.\n\nThe Senate passed its bill on June 15, and the House followed suit a day later.\n\nPresident Biden was in Europe the day the House passed the bill, but returned to the U.S. to sign the bill into law. He signed it on June 17 - just in time for the first Federal Juneteenth National Holiday to take place on June 18. (It was June 18 because June 19 fell on a Saturday that year.)\n\nThe White House invited me to the official signing ceremony, along with the entire Congressional Black Caucus and Ms. Opal Lee, the Texas activist often called \"the grandmother of Juneteenth.\"\n\nAt last, the United States had recognized a holiday to commemorate the end of chattel slavery -- America's original sin -- and to celebrate the perseverance that has been the hallmark of the African American struggle for equity and equality. I am proud to have been part of it.\n\nSheila Jackson Lee represents Texas 18th Congressional District.", "source": {"uri": "houstonchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Houston Chronicle"},

The holiday, which falls on June 19, commemorates the historic day when more than 250,000 enslaved people in Galveston Bay, Texas, finally gained their freedom on June 19, 1865 -- two and a half years after Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation -- and folks have been celebrating Juneteenth for 159 years since.\n\nDespite its significance in American history, Juneteenth -- the name is a mesh of both the month and day, June 19 -- only just became a federal holiday three years ago on June 17, 2021. (It became an official holiday in Texas in 1979.)\n\nWhile the push for it to be officially recognized as a national holiday was championed by many, there is arguably no one who campaigned harder than Opal Lee, 96, a retired teacher, counselor, activist, and native Texan. At 89 years old, Lee, who has earned the moniker the \"grandmother of Juneteenth,\" walked from her home in Fort Worth, Texas, to Washington, D.C., logging two and a half miles each day to represent the two and a half year period between the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Lincoln and the release of enslaved Texans. Her hard work paid off too, because she was right by President Joseph R. Biden's side when he signed the bill to recognize the day.\n\nIn honor of Juneteenth, we've brought together a mix of inspiring and symbolic quotes from politicians, scholars, activists, and celebrities that capture and celebrate the importance of the day.", "source": {"uri": "realsimple.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Real Simple"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multimedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galveston Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opal Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://www.realsimple.com/thmb/IVKrL8_1mDiMJbyZ46w-yJtbr7M=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/juneteenth-quotes-GettyImages-14605725981-b82afd2832a746199f7c3e5ef53b0317.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 406, "textEnd": 413, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 541, "textEnd": 548}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-06-", "textStart": 877, "textEnd": 884}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

It recognizes and celebrates a profound milestone in American history -- the declaration of freedom for an entire race of American people who had been held in bondage for centuries.\n\nAlthough the day itself, June 19, 1865, was far less life-changing than it should have been.\n\nJuneteenth commemorates the arrival of Union Army Major Gen. Gordon Granger in Galveston, Texas, with General Order No. 3 telling the people of the westernmost Confederate state that \"all slaves are free.\" Although the Emancipation Proclamation had taken effect in 1863, it couldn't be implemented until the Civil War ended and Confederate states surrendered.\n\nConfederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered his troops to Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in April 1865 in Virginia, but other Confederate troops farther south and west continued fighting, surrendering only in the months afterward. The 13th Amendment abolishing slavery would be ratified in December 1865.\n\nEnslaved people in Texas were the last ones in the Confederacy to find out they were freed. But the news didn't filter across the state immediately. And some slave owners didn't obey the order right away, waiting to see who would enforce it.\n\nTexas may have been the last Confederate state to get word of emancipation, but in 1980 it became the first U.S. state to make it an official holiday.\n\nJuneteenth is now a federal holiday -- it was observed on Wednesday. It's also recognized as a state holiday in more than 25 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe 1865 announcement of freedom didn't end systemic racism and its discriminatory effects in housing, employment and education. It didn't stop the violence Black people faced day after day, and still do. Black people make up 13% of the U.S. population but account for 37% of the prison and jail population. Similarly, Black people are 37% of the homeless population nationwide.\n\nEfforts to address inequality such as affirmative action are under attack or scuttled. The movement to secure reparations for the ancestors of enslaved people hasn't gained traction in most states. And while California formed a commission that meticulously created a legislative and policy blueprint for reparations, the effort appears to have been put on the back burner. Polls indicate that the majority of white people don't support monetary reparations.\n\nBut there are reasons to celebrate this holiday. Juneteenth is about honoring fortitude, perseverance and, yes, optimism. Those are traits Americans have always had. And they are traits Black Americans have demonstrated in abundance for centuries -- otherwise, no Black people would have survived here. And Black communities have held celebrations big and small for Juneteenth since 1866.\n\nConsider Opal Lee. The former teacher is often called \"the grandmother of Juneteenth\" for her decades of activism to get it designated a federal holiday. When she was a young girl, her Texas home was burned down by a mob of white supremacists on Juneteeth in 1939.\n\nIn 2016, a month before she turned 90, Lee set off on a four-month walk from her hometown of Fort Worth to Washington, D.C., to publicize her cause.

It recognizes and celebrates a profound milestone in American history -- the declaration of freedom for an entire race of American people who had been held in bondage for centuries.\n\nAlthough the day itself, June 19, 1865, was far less life-changing than it should have been.\n\nJuneteenth commemorates the arrival of Union Army Major Gen. Gordon Granger in Galveston, Texas, with General Order No. 3 telling the people of the westernmost Confederate state that \"all slaves are free.\" Although the Emancipation Proclamation had taken effect in 1863, it couldn't be implemented until the Civil War ended and Confederate states surrendered.\n\nConfederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered his troops to Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant in April 1865 in Virginia, but other Confederate troops further south and west continued fighting, surrendering only in the months afterward. The 13 Amendment abolishing slavery would be ratified in December 1865.\n\nEnslaved people in Texas were the last ones in the Confederacy to find out they were freed. But the news didn't filter across the state immediately. And some slave owners didn't obey the order right away, waiting to see who would enforce it.\n\nTexas may have been the last Confederate state to get word of emancipation, but in 1980 it became the first U.S. state to make it an official holiday.\n\nJuneteenth is now a federal holiday. It's also recognized as a state holiday in more than 25 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe 1865 announcement of freedom didn't end systemic racism and its discriminatory effects in housing, employment and education. It didn't stop the violence Black people faced day after day, and still do. Black people make up 13% of the U.S. population but account for 37% of the prison and jail population. Similarly, Black people are 37% of the homeless population nationwide.\n\nEfforts to address inequality such as affirmative action are under attack or scuttled. The movement to secure reparations for the ancestors of enslaved people hasn't gained traction in most states. And while California formed a commission that meticulously created a legislative and policy blueprint for reparations, the effort appears to have been put on the back burner. Polls indicate that the majority of white people don't support monetary reparations (while most Black Californians do).\n\nBut there are reasons to celebrate this holiday. Juneteenth is about honoring fortitude, perseverance and, yes, optimism. Those are traits Americans have always had. And they are traits Black Americans have demonstrated in abundance for centuries -- otherwise, no Black people would have survived here. And Black communities have held celebrations big and small for Juneteenth since 1866.\n\nConsider Opal Lee. The former teacher is often called \"the grandmother of Juneteenth\" for her decades of activism to get it designated a federal holiday. When she was a young girl, her Texas home was burned down by a mob of white supremacists on Juneteeth in 1939.\n\nIn 2016, a month before she turned 90, Lee set off on a four-month walk from her hometown of Fort Worth to Washington, D.C., to publicize her cause. In 2021, Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support passed a bill making Juneteenth a federal holiday, and President Biden signed it into law.\n\nLast month, at 97, Lee stepped across the floor at a White House ceremony to be embraced by Biden as he placed the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, around her neck.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Order No. 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

Subscribe for free. Story idea? Lvernonsparks@charlotteobserver.com\n\nAround Charlotte and the region, some Juneteenth celebrations started happening well before the June 19 holiday.\n\nIn Plaza Midwood, a three-day Juneteenth festival parade hosted by Pape Ndiaye, began last week and ended this past Sunday. Revelers canvassed the streets with colorful and fanciful abandonment.\n\nIf you missed that one, our CharlotteFive team has had its best recommendations for June 19 available for weeks for those who like to plan ahead.\n\nIt's another thing for our social calendars, but Juneteenth is more than that: It's a day of emancipation worthy of flourish and festive display.\n\nIt commemorates the events that took place June 19, 1865, the day when the last group of enslaved Blacks, who lived in Galveston, Texas, finally learned from Union Army troops that they were, indeed finally, free. The Emancipation Proclamation had been signed two years earlier, and while the news spread, freedom wasn't official until all had heard the truth.\n\nAs Americans celebrate July 4th as our nation's independence from British rule, so does the African American community -- and now others -- embrace the history and legacy of Juneteenth, especially since becoming a federal holiday in 2021.\n\nBut what does Juneteenth mean in a day and age where racial injustice continues to challenge and confound our society?\n\nFollowing George Floyd's murder, protests erupted everywhere. Diversity, equity and inclusion policies, while already in existence in some form, became an established practice at most companies and schools. The Black Lives Matter movement, while already in place before 2020, propelled in significance. Many said, \"look at this travesty of George Floyd. We have to do something.\" And so we did.\n\nBut now it seems much of this progress is unraveling.\n\n\"It's really difficult to celebrate (Juneteenth) when our freedoms continue to be in question and our freedoms, our liberation, continue to be under fire and being threatened and attacked,\" said Valerie Kinloch, president of Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte.\n\nKinloch also notes that many people don't understand what Juneteenth is -- and that lack of understanding hinders its reach in reach and cultural significance.\n\n\"We're not teaching it. We're not actually teaching. It's not a requirement in (our) curriculum,\" she shared with The Charlotte Observer.\n\n\"We need to honor it, we need to elevate it, but people need to understand why Juneteenth is really fundamentally important, not just for Black people, but for this entire country when we have conversations about freedom and justice.\"\n\nKinloch questions how society can expand the conversations beyond higher education to ask what things Black communities need to live out the freedoms represented by Juneteenth?\n\n\"How do we center our voices and perspectives in these larger conversations, as opposed to allowing these mandates to come from the top on down and then continue to impact Black communities,\" she said. \"The way that this country has talked about diversity, equity and inclusion has never been enough.\"\n\nPositioned for slow success?\n\nDan Aldridge, III, a history professor and department chair of Africana Studies at Davidson College, says the struggle for Black people is always happening. Any events that become catalysts for change (such as the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, to name only a few) always will be followed by a period where people will push back.\n\n\"It happened after the Civil War with the Reconstruction. It happened after the Civil Rights movement in the 60s and 70s. It happens now. There's always push and pull back and forth. There's always a permanent struggle. There's no, like, 'it's over', \" he said.\n\nWe are better off than our grandparents, says Aldridge, who was born during the Jim Crow era in a Tennessee hospital. Americans tend to have an optimistic view of the world, that perfection can be achieved, but \"all societies have inequalities and struggles whether they have race, like we do, or not,\" Aldridge said.\n\n\"They have internal struggles, inequities, class division. These are kind of, like, permanent features of the human condition. We can make them better, but we'll never entirely defeat them.\"\n\nHe added that holidays, like anything else, take time to grow on people.\n\nIt's mostly a coincidence that Juneteenth is right at the start of the American summer season and how we culturally celebrate.\n\nJuly 4th is on the horizon and there's a heat dome happening in some parts of the country, so the weather is doing its part. There are barbecues, parades, and parties. Juneteenth was celebrated this way for years in Texas and in the south. Black History month is in February and traces its origins to Carter G. Woodson and Negro History Week being honored near Abraham Lincoln's and Frederick Douglass' birthdays. Christmas is right near the December winter solstice festival and Kwanzaa falls right after.\n\n\"Frequently holidays succeed because they kind of build on precedents, and what people already think in their culture are sort of established holiday practices,\" he said. \"I think that's going to be part of what happens at Juneteenth. It (has) happened to every holiday, if you think about it.\"\n\nGive it some time. Juneteenth will find its place among the racial unrest, the good, the bad, the progress, the rollback.

All You Need To Know About This Federal Holiday and Its Historical Significance", "body": "Juneteenth: Americans will gather on June 19 to celebrate Juneteenth, the latest federal holiday in the United States. Although this day has been celebrated by Black Americans since the mid-to-late 1800s, Juneteenth was long omitted from history books and was not designated as a federal holiday until 2021.\n\nThe change came after the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and other Black people in the US renewed the push for conversations on racial justice and the holiday's recognition at the national level.\n\n\"It recognizes liberation, it recognizes freedom. Some people will refer to it as Black Independence Day. It's a day to celebrate the ending of an era of 246 years of enslavement that African Americans experienced in this country,\" Daina Ramey Berry, Professor of History and Dean of Humanities and Fine Arts at the University of California, Santa Barbara said to TIME.\n\nThe significance of Juneteenth might not be known to many Americans, since they might not have learned about the event in school. \"Many people assume that freedom began with the Emancipation Proclamation and think of Lincoln as the great liberator,\" Berry said to TIME.\n\nOn January 1, 1863, President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring that \"all persons held as slaves\" in the Confederacy or states that seceded from the Union, \"are, and henceforward shall be free.\" But that freedom did not come immediately, as the Civil War continued on and Union soldiers went from state to state to enforce the measure. \"Essentially, very few enslaved people were freed in 1863,\" says Berry.\n\nOn June 19, 1865, two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued and two months after the Civil War officially ended, Union Army General Gordon Granger, accompanied by 2,000 soldiers, arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform enslaved people of their freedom.\n\n\"When the Union army reached Galveston and notified Black people of their freedom, it generally signified that the last segment of the roughly four million slaves in the South, now knew they were officially free,\" Nafeesa Muhammad, Associate Professor of History at Spelman College, told TIME in an email. \"And this is the significance of Juneteenth.\"\n\nJuneteenth marks the day in 1865 enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, found out they had been freed -- after the end of the Civil War, and two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nJust after the Civil War ended, outdoor spaces facilitated large, lively reunions among formerly enslaved families, many of whom had been separated. These gatherings were particularly revolutionary as they were free from the restrictive measures known as \"Black Codes.\" Enforced in Confederate states, these codes controlled various aspects of daily life for liberated slaves, including their ability to vote, buy property, gather for worship, and more.\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\nThe important thing is to make people feel they have options on how to observe the occasion, said Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture.\n\n\"Just like the Martin Luther King holiday, we say it's a day of service and a lot of people will do things. There are a lot of other people who are just 'I appreciate Dr. King, I'll watch what's on the television, and I'm gonna rest,'\" Anderson said. \"I don't want to make people feel guilty about that. What I want to do is give everyday people a choice.\"", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Santa_Barbara", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Santa Barbara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secession in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Codes_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Codes (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelman_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spelman College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King Jr. Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Community service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US_Civil_War", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Antiques/US Civil War", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.india.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Juneteenth-main.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 37, "textEnd": 44}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 1600, "textEnd": 1607}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Black Americans are no longer the focus.", "body": "Here's why this once local celebration is significant to U.S. history.\n\nIf not our humanity, access to education nor reluctant police reform, Black Americans at the least are owed a Freedom Day that is indicative of our past, not a fabricated \"celebration\" that centers corporations and profit. Louisville has lost the heart of Juneteenth not even five years after it became a federal holiday.\n\nIt is disheartening that the Louisville Juneteenth Festival is not rooted in true community, but instead in the two notorious Ps: profit and pictures. The festival should be free with no tickets, no vendor fees and no corporations. But instead, Lynn Family Stadium will be hosting. If any, it should be a Black-owned business or one that is regularly in network with Black Louisville.\n\nAt the next cookout, ask your family when is the last time they visited Lynn Family Stadium or even played soccer. Which isn't to say Black people don't visit the stadium or play soccer; it is to say such partnerships should follow cultural engagement and traditions. This is a forced attempt at trying to blend two different communities when Juneteenth should be a day of Pan-Africanism. It is selling out in the name of PR.\n\nSimilarly, as inconvenient as slavery was, are we not owed a Freedom Day that inconveniences the work week? June 19 falls on a Wednesday this year, yet the festival is on June 15 because it is a Saturday. Again, our freedom is contingent on some outside factor.\n\nA Juneteenth festival true to Black liberation would be held on the day, no matter what logistical efforts lie ahead. Because that's how nonnegotiable and unwavering our freedom is.\n\nDon't whitewash Juneteenth: Black people shouldn't have to lose identity to promote holiday\n\nJuneteenth has lost its original meaning\n\nJuneteenth as a federal and now state holiday is humorous to say the least. White people having a paid day off on Juneteenth is not only the antithesis of the entire day, it represents a sinister cycle of America reluctantly giving Black Americans what we are owed, and only if white America can benefit from it.\n\nWe still struggle with housing, education, transportation and health because of the generational ignorance to racism. To pay white people on Juneteenth is a slap in the face to every Black American and the ancestors we come from. If these systems were so invested in helping Black communities, they would commit to that notion materially. They would put their money where their mouths are.\n\nBut we as Black Americans know better than to expect that.\n\nSo each year it'll get worse. More red and green will seep into marketing flyers.

I looked at one of the papers and frowned. Why did Eli Whitney, who we grownups were taught was a Black man who invented the cotton gin, appear to be white? My children informed me that Eli Whitney was, in fact, white. Turns out, they were right. My mind was blown.\n\nWe learned very little about Black history -- which is American history -- growing up. We were limited to Eli Whitney (who, again, wasn't Black), Dr. King, and Rosa Parks. We learned a dollop here and there about slavery and Civil Rights. However, white-washed, patriarchal history was the norm, where white people were almost always elevated above any people of color as the ones who were right and pure. We said the Pledge of Allegiance every morning, completely unaware that \"liberty and justice for all\" was not really on the country's radar. It sounded good, but it didn't actually exist.\n\nAll my Black history education came from self-educating. I didn't begin this learning journey until my junior year of college when I took an African American Literature class -- taught by an older, white professor. I went on to graduate, attend grad school, and become a teacher myself. With each class, I grew more and more agitated. Why hadn't I learned comprehensive history?\n\nSince my husband and I became parents almost 15 years ago, a lot has changed -- for the better. Though the U.S. has a long way to go in terms of eradicating the preschool-to-prison pipeline, mortgage loan discrimination, voter discrimination, systemic racism, and more, we are grateful for the process our multiracial family has seen in recent years. Black History Month is commonplace (though we argue that Black history is history, and we should learn it year-round, not just in February). The CROWN Act, \"a law that prohibits race-based hair discrimination,\" is now legal in 24 states. In 2021, President Biden signed a bill making Juneteenth a federal holiday.\n\nFor those who don't know, the Smithsonian reports that Juneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, the day when \"some 2,000 Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas. The army announced that more than 250,000 enslaved black people in the state were free by the executive decree.\" The executive decree refers to the Emancipation Proclamation, which went into effect two years prior, but \"could not be implemented in places still under Confederate control.\"\n\nJuneteenth is also known as Freedom Day and Emancipation Day. Though America tends to put the 4 of July on a pedestal as America's birthday and thus, the people's Independence Day, many Americans were not free in 1776. Not even close.\n\nOur four children are Black, and for several years now, we have chosen to honor Juneteenth. They've attended a local Juneteenth festival with food, games, activities, and entertainment. Last year, we decided to design and wear Juneteenth tees and wear them for the Juneteenth holiday. Other ways families may choose to celebration is making a soul food meal or patronizing a Black-owned restaurant. They may decorate with banners, balloons, and fabrics featuring the Juneteenth colors: red, black, and green. Our family owns several books about Juneteenth that we display every June.\n\nWe want our kids to understand comprehensive American history in the ways we never got to. This means -- gasp! -- changing tradition. For us, the true day of the start of independence is Juneteenth, not July the 4. Only some powerful white men became free in 1776. Freedom for women, the disabled, LGBTQIA, children, and people of color would come much later -- as in, we are still fighting for those freedoms today. Juneteenth was a start for our kids, but there is still so much progress to be made.\n\nAs parents, we continue to learn and grow. As more and more true history becomes available and circulated, we are gaining the education that we never got. We hope that by evolving, we show our children the importance of learning their history and celebrating their future, because so many amazing people went before them ... and dreamed of today.", "source": {"uri": "sheknows.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheKnows"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_garlinghouse@sheknows.com", "name": "Rachel Garlinghouse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Whitney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eli Whitney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African-American history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pledge of Allegiance (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_gin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cotton gin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rosa Parks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patriarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiracial_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multiracial people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galveston Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_History_Month", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black History Month"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institutional racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smithsonian Institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Education", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Our-Family-Celebrates-Juneteenth-Every-Year-Because-July-4th-Wasnt-Made-For-My-Kids.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 2533, "textEnd": 2542, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 2063, "textEnd": 2070}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, and delivered General Order No. 3 announcing the end of legalized slavery in Texas. Historically, it has been a holiday celebrated by people of African descent in the United States, as well as people in Canada, Jamaica, Nigeria, the United Kingdom and other countries throughout the world.\n\nJuneteenth is also a \"symbolic date\" representing the African American struggle for freedom and equality, and a celebration of family and community.\n\nAlthough two years and six months had passed since President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, many African Americans remained enslaved in Confederate states and also in the border slave states that remained loyal to the Union. The surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, 1865, had not impacted Texas. Many plantation owners refused to acknowledge that the war was over and refused to \"release\" their enslaved workers from bondage. This practice continued even after the issuance of General Order No. 3.\n\nGeneral Order No. 3, delivered by Granger on June 19, 1865, stated:\n\n\"The people (of Texas) are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain (quietly) at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.\"\n\nMany enslaved Blacks in Texas had already escaped prior to Granger's announcement. A brigade of the 25th Army Corps, comprised of more than 1,000 African-descendant soldiers, arrived in Galveston and captured Galveston on June 5, 1865, a week before Granger's arrival. They chased the rebel government and soldiers into Mexico. The Black soldiers of the 25th Army Corps also spread the word about freedom, and Civil War historians estimate that thousands of enslaved people escaped to freedom because of the actions of the 25th Army Corps.\n\nThe struggle for freedom and equal rights has continued, and so has the celebration of Juneteenth, as people of African descent and others commemorate Juneteenth in their homes, churches, schools and communities. They attend church services, host parades, races, picnics, oratorical contests, musical, literary and cultural festivals, and often visit cemeteries to reunite the freed and living with their enslaved ancestors. Since Jan. 1, 1980, when Texas officially recognized Juneteenth as a state holiday, more than 40 other states have passed legislation observing or recognizing the significance of Juneteenth. Historians have observed that Juneteenth remains significant because it is one of the earliest continuously observed holidays that African Americans established in the United States; it signifies for the African American population that America is the land of the free and that the fight for equality is ever present and ongoing.\n\nCopy article link", "source": {"uri": "azdailysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Daily Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._3", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Order No. 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_complexes_in_the_Southern_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plantation complexes in the Southern United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Appomattox Court House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_states_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Border states (American Civil War)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

It's got to be about substance.'\n\nWednesday will not be the first official observance of Juneteenth in Michigan, but it will be the first time it is celebrated as an official state holiday.\n\n\"On Juneteenth, we come together to celebrate fundamental American values of freedom and equality, embodied by the stories and legacies of the Black community,\" Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in signing legislation last year. \"Juneteenth is a moment of celebration and reflection, but it is also an opportunity to recommit ourselves to action.\"\n\nJuneteenth recognizes the date, June 19, 1865, that Union Army Gen. Gordon Granger landed in Galveston, Texas, and read General Order No. 3, stating that all enslaved people were free, and that former masters and enslaved people were absolutely equal in personal and property rights.\n\nIts importance has long been celebrated in the African-American community as the country's second Independence Day, marking the last place in the former Confederacy that experienced emancipation. Although as the National Museum of African American History and Culture has noted, it was only through passage of the Thirteenth Amendment that slavery was truly abolished throughout the United States.\n\nIn Michigan, official acknowledgement of the day's importance was made back in 2005 when then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm signed legislation officially designating the third Saturday in June as Juneteenth National Freedom Day in Michigan.\n\nBut it wasn't until July 2023 that legislation making Juneteenth an official state holiday was signed by Whitmer, making this year the first time that the state will be in line with the federal government after President Joe Biden made Juneteenth a national holiday in 2021.\n\nKeith Williams, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus (MDPBC), tells the Michigan Advance that while that is certainly a step forward, he has concerns that Juneteenth's true meaning may get lost in the celebration, namely that the bondage of slavery encompasses more than just the literal chains that kept people in servitude.\n\n\"It was good to get your freedom, but we're not economically free,\" he said. \"If you're going to put it all in perspective, I want to be on an equal footing, economically, educationally, and make sure I have the quality of care that is necessary to grow my community.\"\n\nWilliams, who is African American and a Detroit resident, chairs the City of Detroit Reparations Task Force. He says there are three words that he'd like people to think about on Juneteenth: repair, heal and rebuild.\n\n\"If we don't repair all the structural things that happened to African Americans, we'll just be celebrating with no substance behind it. Then you have to heal all the pain that was caused by slavery and all that has happened to municipalities, like running freeway systems through African American neighborhoods,\" said Williams.\n\nOnce that is accomplished, he added, the rebuilding of those neighborhoods can begin with equitable access to capital and investment in an educational system that serves all students.\n\n\"I just think it's got to be more than just a celebratory situation,\" he said. \"It's got to be about substance.\"\n\nOne measure of that substance is the representation of the Black community in Lansing's corridors of power.\n\nAs Michigan Senate Democrats noted in a release on Tuesday, state Sen. Sylvia Santana (D-Detroit), who sponsored Senate Bill 50 to permanently designate Juneteenth as a state holiday, is one of three Senate members in the Michigan Legislative Black Caucus (MLBC), along with Sens. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor) and Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing).\n\n\"With Sens. Santana, Geiss and Anthony leading the charge, Senate Democrats have passed several impactful pieces of legislation and made meaningful and historic budget investments aimed at supporting and uplifting Black Michiganders and communities,\" stated the release.\n\nThat \"impactful legislation\" includes bills under consideration to strengthen Michigan's hate crime laws and voting protections, as well as cap payday lending interest rates. Additionally, each has seen their bills become law, including Santana's Filter First legislation to protect children from lead in drinking water at schools and child care centers, and Anthony's CROWN Act, which bans race-based discrimination due to how someone wears their hair.\n\nState Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is white, co-sponsored the bill to make Juneteenth a state holiday. She tells the Advance that for it to truly have an impact on society as a whole, it has to reach beyond the Black community, which requires some introspection and an honest reckoning with our country's history.\n\n\"Especially in this moment, when too many people would rather erase or whitewash our history than face it in all of its truth, acknowledging Juneteenth is so essential,\" said McMorrow. \"I was honored to be a small part in making it official in Michigan. Just this week, I've overheard conversations out at the store or in public with people asking each other, 'What is Juneteenth?' For far too many people, especially those who look like me, so much of our country's history was left out of what we learned in school. Juneteenth is a part of our history and a celebration!\"\n\nMcMorrow said she hopes Juneteenth not only becomes a moment to learn, but a moment to celebrate, calling it \"a shining example that we can always decide to do what's right.\"\n\n\"Even for a wrong as ugly and shameful as slavery, Americans righted this shameful wrong. That's worth celebrating so that it may be an example to everyone that it's never too late to make things right,\" said McMorrow.\n\nIn his annual proclamation about Juneteenth, President Joe Biden acknowledged the need to make things right through direct economic action.\n\n\"That includes the funding we are delivering to support predominantly Black neighborhoods that had been divided and left behind by segregation and racial discrimination, the checks we delivered that reduced Black child poverty to the lowest rate in history, the changes we have made to the appraisals process to root out biases that put Black homeowners at a disadvantage,\" said Biden.\n\nWilliams says he hopes to see similar efforts at the state level, noting the MDPBC last year proposed Gov. Whitmer create a commission to study the harms of slavery and develop policies to try and make amends.\n\nWhile Whitmer's office has yet to respond to that request, her spokesperson, Stacey LaRouche, sent the Advance a statement.\n\n\"Governor Whitmer is proud to have declared Juneteenth as a state holiday in Michigan, so we can celebrate fundamental American values of freedom and equality, embodied by the stories and legacies of the Black community. The Whitmer-Gilchrist Administration recognizes the work that remains to build a more equitable state, and we will continue to focus on making Michigan a place where everyone can thrive,\" said LaRouche.\n\nThe administration has also spearheaded multiple efforts to address racial inequities, including establishing the Racial Disparities Task Force, which virtually eliminated the racial disparity in deaths caused by COVID-19, and creating the Black Leadership Advisory Council to recommend policies and actions designed to prevent and eradicate discrimination and racial inequity in Michigan.\n\nRegardless, Williams says he'd like to see both Biden and former President Donald Trump be asked as part of the presidential election if they would support reparations for the harms of slavery, not in the form of a cash handout, but in a sincere effort to undo the systemic racism directed against people of color for generations.\n\n\"Joe is going to say yes. We already know Joe Biden's history in the African-American community,\" said Williams. \"I want to know since Donald Trump came to Detroit to a Black church and the church was full of white folks, that would be the opportune time to ask him, 'What do you feel about reparations?'. ... It's going to be discombobulated. It is going to be 'We want to Make America Great Again' kind of sh-t.\"\n\nPolitics aside, there have already been Juneteenth events in Michigan in Lansing and Detroit. There are more opportunities for residents to not only celebrate Juneteenth, but learn more about the issues that give the holiday impact.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Charles H. Wright Museum in Detroit is hosting its annual Juneteenth Jubilee from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., featuring performances and speakers highlighting \"education, economic independence, and community engagement,\" while the Detroit Riverfront Conservancy will host the Dequindre Cut from 2 p.m. to 7 p.m. with storytelling, live music, vendors, and food trucks located on the eastern border of the historic Black Bottom neighborhood.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Justice 4 All's Juneteenth Jam in Grand Rapids will take place in Calder Plaza from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. with Black-owned food vendors, along with live musical performances, kids games, and art showcases.", "source": {"uri": "michiganadvance.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Michigan Advance"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Every year, it is celebrated on June 19 to commemorate the end of the inhuman practice of slavery in the US. It was named after the month of June and the date 19th, since it was on June 19, 1865, that the order of the final enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas came from Major General Gordon Granger. However, it took place only in former Confederate states and even after its enforcement, legally enslaved people were in the US in those places that never seceded from the Union. They got their freedom till the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified on December 6, 1865.\n\nOn September 22, 1862, Abraham Lincoln, the President of the United States declared that the Emancipation Proclamation would be implemented on January 1, 1863. It brought freedom to people who were kept as slaves in the rebellious parts of Southern states of the Confederacy which included Texas. However, the process of enforcement was slow and inconsistent in other places which were still fighting the Union soldiers. Notably, on June 19, 1865, after the Union soldiers arrived in Galveston Texas the state's residents finally learned about the abolition of slavery. The enslaved people, after knowing about their freedom, immediately began to celebrate with prayer, feasting, song, and dance.\n\nOn June 19, 1857, Texas witnessed the first official Juneteenth celebrations. It was done through prayer meetings and spiritual singing and former slaves wore new clothes which denoted their newfound freedom. Within a few years, African Americans in other states began to celebrate Juneteenth and it became an annual tradition. All over the US, celebrations of Juneteenth have continued well into the 21st century. Today, the celebrations generally encompass religious services and prayers, speeches, family gatherings, educational events, picnics, and festivals with food, music and dancing.\n\nIn 2021, the US made Juneteenth a federal holiday. It was the first federal holiday in the country since Martin Luther King Jr. Day which was adopted in 1983.

Laura Kelly, this year's Juneteenth marks the first time Kansas will officially observe the holiday.\n\nHowever, Kansas African American Affairs Commission executive director Stacey Knoell told audience members this is not the first celebration of Juneteenth in the state. She recognized multiple Kansas cities that have celebrated the holiday for many years.\n\nThe first official state observation in Kansas\n\nJuneteenth, a holiday celebrating the liberation of slaves on June 19, 1865, became a federal holiday in 2021 after President Joe Biden signed into law its recognition.\n\nThen in October Kelly declared Kansas the 29th state to recognize Juneteenth as a state holiday. She has recognized the holiday since 2020 by issuing proclamations. However, it wasn't a formal public holiday, meaning state employees didn't get the day off.\n\n\"As we celebrate Juneteenth, we need to also recognize the way Black Kansans have pushed forward and been a force in our nation on the path to freedom,\" Kelly said. \"They are Black Kansans like Gwendolyn Brooks, Langston Hughes, and Aaron Douglass who shaped the Harlem Renaissance, elevating the image of Blacks from caricatures to enlightened contributors to American culture and entertainment.\"\n\nKelly also said it is important to recognize our history and celebrate our freedoms or else history may repeat itself.\n\n\"Today there are some who try to minimize those contributions, to rewrite or eliminate certain parts of history,\" Kelly said. \"If we do not face and learn from our history, we are bound to repeat it.\"\n\nAmerica's second Independence Day\n\nKeynote speaker Anthony Lewis said when the Fourth of July was celebrated early on it was not considered a day of independence for those enslaved.\n\n\"Frederick Douglass gave a keynote address, an Independence Day celebration held at printing hall in Rochester, New York and asked the question, what to the slave is the Fourth of July,\" Lewis said as his voice reverberated through the halls of the statehouse first floor.\n\nLewis said Juneteenth is considered a second Independence Day and a call to action because the work is not done.\n\n\"The significance of Juneteenth rose beyond just this historical event itself,\" Lewis said. \"The historical legacy of Juneteenth shows the value of never giving up hope in uncertain times. It symbolizes the resilience of strength, the determination of the African American community in the face of adversity and oppression. We acknowledge the Black injustices of slavery, but also the resilience, the strength and the perseverance of African Americans who fought for their freedom and continue to strive for equality long after the shackles of slavery were removed.\"", "source": {"uri": "eu.cjonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "topeka_capital_journal@eu.cjonline.com", "name": "Topeka Capital-Journal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laura Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_Every_Voice_and_Sing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lift Every Voice and Sing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwendolyn_Brooks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gwendolyn Brooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harlem Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langston_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Langston Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frederick Douglass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Culture of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rochester, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rochester, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/17/NTCJ/74126372007-20240617-juneteenth-kansas-statehouse-en-4.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5999,3375,x0,y312&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 618, "textEnd": 625}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

It wasn't until June 19, 1865, when U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger announced General Order No. 3 in Galveston, Texas when more than 250,000 enslaved people were finally free.\n\nJuneteenth, a combination of the words June and nineteenth became a federal holiday June 17, 2021. Before that, it was a uniquely Texan observance for many years, which is why Connie Ali, 82nd Training Wing Equal Opportunity director, did not learn about it herself until adulthood. A North Carolina native, Ali said she was never taught about the significance of the day. Now, she is on a mission to make sure people understand the importance of the holiday.\n\n\"I think people on the installation should have an awareness what Juneteenth means to people outside the gates,\" she said. \"If they see a parade or different events going on and they're not from Texas, they may not have an understanding. But if we educate and give them an awareness, they know why they are celebrating this. I just feel as if we, the people on the installation and the leaders, can articulate it ourselves, it will give a better awareness to the younger people.\"\n\nAlthough Juneteenth is the oldest recognized African American-celebrated observance, it's still new to many Americans. For Ali, the shared experience of becoming more aware of the meaning behind the holiday is a chance to talk about where we've been as Americans, where we are, and where we're going.\n\n\"Learning about Juneteenth should bring up conversations to say that 'hey, this is a significant event that happened in our history and let's talk about it.' I just think that some people fear of talking about it because of the term slave. And that can cause a divisive conversation. But I would find it's a great opportunity to say, look at how far we have come. Let's just talk and truly have conversations about it. Because it is an important, important event in American history.\"\n\nThis Juneteenth, Ali hopes people will stop and reflect about why it's celebrated as they enjoy the holiday itself.\n\n\"Let us observe Juneteenth just as we observe Independence Day - as a significant turning point for freedom in our nation's history, and one where we were willing to pay a heavy price to ultimately live out our highest principles,\" she said. \"As we commemorate Juneteenth, let us embrace the opportunity to learn and empathize by recognizing the importance of this historical event.\"\n\nU.S. Air Force Logo /U.S. Air Force Release.

In some states public readings and singing, picnics and church services, rodeos, contests, concerts and parades are also organised.\n\nHowever, the attempts to have Juneteenth declared a federal holiday were decades in the making.\n\nIn 2016, 89-year-old Opal Lee walked from Texas to Washington DC to raise awareness and encourage lawmakers. She walked 2.5 miles (4km) each day -- representing the two-and-a-half years it took for enslaved people in Texas to learn they had been freed.\n\nBarack Obama as senator of Illinois had co-sponsored legislation to make Juneteenth a national holiday, but the law was never passed -- even after he became president.\n\nIt took the Black Lives Matter protests around the world in the summer of 2020 to create the conditions for its passing. Leading up to June 19 2021, both chambers of the US Congress moved swiftly to pass the Bill, which became law with President Joe Biden finally signing the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, establishing a holiday to commemorate the end of slavery in the US.\n\nAs Juneteenth is celebrated, the more informed will spend time to also reflect on the heinous crime committed against their ancestors. The legacy of which they live with today, with widespread discrimination and mistreatment.\n\nMuch like the Windrush celebrations in Britain, we are meant to forget the 40 years of the mistreatment of Caribbean peoples with the \"hostile environment\" scandal, under the watch of Theresa May, who seems to be in denial about her actions.\n\nEven as we are encouraged to celebrate Windrush Day in Britain, the mistreatment continues, as payouts are slowed and justice denied the victims of this shameful scandal.\n\nIn the US some debate about the 40 acres and a mule promised to the former enslaved who fought with the northern army for their liberation continues. Some of the discussions have morphed into the Reparations for African Enslavement movement which has started to gain some worldwide traction.\n\nWe need be aware that the ideology of racism developed to justify enslavement of Africans continues to take the lives of many black men in the US today.\n\nMany who were killed by the police were unarmed, leading to calls to defund the police, who have their origins in the slave-catchers, deployed to apprehend runaway slaves in times past.\n\nThe ending of slavery did not do away with racism, and in the years after emancipation, so-called Jim Crow laws were created to separate black people from white society and limit their civil rights.\n\nThe deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other African-Americans at the hands of the police have spurred international anti-racism protests. The backlash comes in the form of \"wokeness\" that threatens to stifle debate.\n\nIt also comes as a cultural debate rages over the teaching of history about slavery, and how it should be taught in US schools, with the banning of books in some states, reminiscent of the McCarthy years.\n\nAs Americans party to celebrate Juneteenth it will be wise for them to also recognise that it is only by struggle any justice will be delivered.\n\nAfrican-Americans must never forget their history and join the worldwide movement to fight for Reparations for African Enslavement.", "source": {"uri":

This is a guy who seems harmless but he kinda freaks everyone out, because he's creepy. There's just something off about the guy. He seems kinda stalkerish and he makes the female bartender very uncomfortable. Hell, he makes me uncomfortable.\n\nI wasn't paying any attention to him and after he left, the bartender told me he was griping about Juneteenth and how it shouldn't be a holiday. It must have went like, \"Check, please...and I hate Juneteenth.\" I was sorry I missed that comment as I would have inquired why he thinks Juneteenth shouldn't be a holiday...and then perhaps I would have kicked him in the goober.\n\nNo, I'm not violent. I would have only metaphorically kicked him in the goober. Maybe his reasons would be that we don't need two Independence Days or that it shouldn't be a holiday because it doesn't apply to everyone. One of the reasons many Republicans gave for voting to make it a federal holiday is that it's a financial burden to give federal employees another paid day off. That is a weird complaint coming from the party that increased our deficit by over $17 trillion in the Trump years. Ugh.\n\nWe should have two Independence Days since the first one, July 4, the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, did not give independence to every American, just the white ones. The closest we came to a day of independence for everyone before President Biden made Juneteenth our 11th federal holiday was the movie where Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and Bill Pullman saved us from aliens too stupid to install Norton. Goldblum also saved us from dinosaurs at least three times. Maybe he should have a federal holiday. The only thing Jeff Goldblum hasn't done is find Matt Damon, who's had to be rescued in at least eight movies (Courage Under Fire, Saving Private Ryan, Titan A.E, Syriana, Green Zone, Elysium, Interstellar, and The Martian, all at an estimated cost of over $900 billion).\n\nJuneteenth was the day in 1865 that slaves in Texas discovered the Civil War was over. This occurred about a month after the war ended and nearly two years after Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It still takes a while for real news to reach Texas, like they're not free to secede, Obama is NOT invading them, or Ted Cruz is a scaly Reptilian-humanoid-type thing that probably eats babies so you shouldn't vote for it. If you happen to run across a Texan, let him know. Eventually, June 19 became recognized as a day of independence for Black Americans. What's wrong with that?\n\nMartin Luther King Jr Day is not just a holiday for Black Americans because civil rights should be important for all of us. While Juneteenth is mostly celebrated by Black Americans, it should be recognized and appreciated by every American. It's good to live in a country that doesn't have legal slavery... Right? Right? Besides, we have two holidays for veterans in addition to commemorating other days like December 7 and June 6.\n\nAs for the argument that not everyone celebrates Juneteenth, it's the same for Christmas. While the majority of this nation is Christian, over 30 percent aren't. I don't have a problem saying \"Merry Christmas\" to people, but on the day itself, I order Chinese food just like my Jewish friends do. The entire week before December 25, I struggle to think about anything other than the kung pao chicken coming my way.\n\nHere's the deal, white people. Not everything is about you. Not everything is for you. As some people have pointed out, equality is not pie. Giving Black Americans a holiday doesn't take any of your holidays away from you. There will not be less Christmas and on that day, you will still get pie, unless you're in a Gary Varvel cartoon where brown people climb into your window and steal your holiday food (actually Thanksgiving, but work with me, people). But if you're a Black person in a Mike Lester cartoon, you will get some fried chicken.\n\nWhat I don't get is that people, like the Creepster, are publicly announcing that they don't like Juneteenth. It's weird how passionate people are about their hate. Nobody asked the Creepster for his opinion on Juneteenth. Oddly enough, he was expressing his racism in a restaurant where 90 percent of the staff is non-white.

From barbeque chicken to fresh strawberry soda, these Juneteenth recipes will make the holiday even more memorable.\n\nJuneteenth, or June 19, is a festival celebrated to commemorate freedom and the abolishment of slavery. A significant day in African-American history, this day marks the end of slavery in the United States. Also known as Freedom Day, this celebration is considered the longest-running African-American holiday and has been deemed America's second Independence Day. Like most celebrations in the US, food plays a vital role in Juneteenth. Many of the most classic Juneteenth dishes are also the most symbolic. To honour and celebrate the historic day of Juneteenth 2024, we bring you delicious recipes of Juneteenth traditional food and drinks. From barbeque chicken to fresh strawberry soda, these Juneteenth recipes will make the holiday even more memorable.\n\nThe celebration of Juneteenth takes place with prayer gatherings, spiritual singing, new clothing, and the preparation of traditional food items to symbolise freedom. The traditions usually consist of red food, which signifies sacrifice, power and resilience. Additionally, Juneteenth is the best time to get summer fruits like watermelon and strawberries. Therefore, Strawberry soda and hibiscus tea are typical red drinks served during Juneteenth festivities, along with the famous red velvet cake and barbecue, among other dishes. To celebrate this festival of freedom, we have created a list of Juneteenth recipes, from barbeque chicken to strawberry soda and the all-time favourite red velvet cake; here are a few recipes you need to try to celebrate the US federal holiday.\n\nBarbeque Chicken is one of the most cooked delicacies to celebrate Juneteenth. Barbecue usually includes grilled meats like ribs, chicken, and sausages cooked slowly over a fire or hot coals.\n\nOriginated in Nashville, Tennessee, the recipe involves marinating chicken in a spicy seasoning, frying it until crispy, and then coating it with a fiery, cayenne pepper-based sauce.

The date would become etched in the collective memory of Black America as Juneteenth, a day of jubilation that outshone even the Fourth of July, a testament to the enduring power of freedom.\n\nIn an era where the very foundations of American democracy are under strain, the observance of Juneteenth offers a potent lens through which to examine our country's ongoing struggle for racial justice and true equality. It is a mirror held up to the nation, reflecting both the progress made and the progress yet to be made.\n\nJuneteenth is a stark reminder that freedom and equality have never come easily or swiftly to Black Americans. Even the Emancipation Proclamation, with its noble rhetoric, did not instantly abolish slavery. It took the bloody triumph of the Union, followed by the slow arrival of federal troops in recalcitrant Texas, to make emancipation a reality. This lag exposes the enduring gap between America's lofty ideals and the lived experience of its Black citizens, a chasm that persists to this day.\n\nFast forward to our present moment. The struggles that fueled the Black Lives Matter movement -- the systemic racism ingrained in this nation's justice system, the wealth gap rooted in generations of disenfranchisement, the representation that remains tokenistic in many halls of power -- are the remnants of the unfinished work that began on Juneteenth. They underscore that freedom, like emancipation before it, is not a singular event but an ongoing quest, a marathon rather than a sprint. The baton passed down through generations, each one called upon to run their leg of the race.\n\nJuneteenth is a testament to the irrepressible resilience of Black culture. Even in bondage, enslaved Africans wove vibrant tapestries of music, art and spirituality that would enrich the nation in ways their captors could hardly imagine. They found joy in the midst of sorrow, hope in the depths of despair.\n\nToday, as Black Americans commemorate Juneteenth with red foods and lively music, they honor a lineage of strength that has weathered the storms of slavery, Jim Crow and enduring injustice. These expressions bear witness to the indomitable will to survive, to thrive, to be free.\n\nThis cultural fortitude holds a lesson for our broader society. At a time when social media echo chambers threaten to splinter the nation, the collective joy and remembrance of Juneteenth model a different path. They demonstrate that reckoning with painful history need not divide us, provided we approach it with open hearts and a willingness to listen, to truly hear the stories of our fellow Americans. By embracing Juneteenth, Americans of all backgrounds can gain a deeper understanding of the Black experience and find common ground in the universal yearning for freedom and equality that defines us as a people. We can forge a shared identity, not in spite of our differences, but because of them.\n\nBut perhaps the most vital truth that Juneteenth imparts is that the work of racial justice is never truly done. Observance of Juneteenth should not be an act of complacency, but a call to action, a rallying cry to complete the unfinished work of our democracy. As we mark this holiday, we must recommit ourselves to dismantling the systems that still disenfranchise Black Americans, from voter suppression to mass incarceration. We must strive for schools where every child, regardless of color, receives an education that nurtures their potential, that sees their worth and dignity. And we must build an economy where the prosperity fueled by Black innovation and labor is equitably shared, where the fruits of freedom are not reserved for the few, but enjoyed by all.\n\nIn short, Juneteenth is both a rejoicing and a reckoning. It invites us to revel in the progress forged by generations of Black Americans, even as it illuminates the long road still to be traveled. As we commemorate this sacred day, let us honor its spirit by rededicating ourselves to the unfinished work of a more perfect union -- one where the freedom and equality promised that day in 1865 are at last a reality for all. Let us march forward together, our hearts full of hope, our hands full of the tools to build a nation worthy of its highest ideals. For on Juneteenth, we are reminded that freedom is not merely a gift, but a task -- one that falls to us, the living, to complete.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic slave trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Order_No._3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Order No. 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abolitionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disfranchisement_after_the_Reconstruction_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disfranchisement after the Reconstruction era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serfdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African-American culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow_laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Crow laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Institutional racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirituality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spirituality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter suppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incarceration in the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/yakimaherald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/a6/fa61b564-2c5d-11ef-b763-77dd585e418f/666fb4e99409d.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 24, "textEnd": 31}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Perkins Kwoka tried to make Juneteenth a New Hampshire holiday; House said no.", "body": "CONCORD -- While Juneteenth has been a federal holiday since 2021, in New Hampshire, it's simply a day of observance, putting it in the same category of celebratory days as Halloween and Earth Day.\n\nThis year, state Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, D-Portsmouth, introduced Senate Bill 481 to instead establish June 19, Juneteenth, as an annual state holiday in New Hampshire.\n\n\"When Juneteenth was observed last year in Portsmouth, many, many of my constituents were very surprised to learn that though it was a federal holiday, it was only recognized as a state observance and not an official state holiday,\" said Perkins Kwoka on the Senate floor in April. \"This bill would give Juneteenth proper status (and) reflected significance to so many people across our state whose important history is now officially recognized.\"\n\nWhile the bill passed the Senate with bipartisan support, it was later killed by the House in early May.\n\n\"The committee rejected this declassification for two major reasons,\" wrote Rep. Sherry Gould, R-Warner, in the House Committee of Executive Departments and Administration's recommendation of inexpedient to legislate. \"First, June 19th is late in the academic year and we feared its effect on finals and other end of academic year exercises. Secondly, as a holiday, it might well be adopted as another day off for government employees. The committee was concerned that government offices would be closed while private citizens were working.\"\n\nAt the House executive session on SB 481, where the representatives unanimously voted against the bill, Gould also highlighted the committee's \"consistent record on not continuing to proliferate mandated holidays.\"\n\nThat is part of the reason JerriAnne Boggis, the executive director of the Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire, said the result was not a surprise. In 1999, New Hampshire became the last state to officially name Martin Luther King Jr. Day a state holiday, more than a decade after Illinois became the first state to create the holiday in 1985.\n\nNew Hampshire was also one of the last states to name Juneteenth as a day of observance, not doing so until 2019. Texas was the first to recognize Juneteenth as a state holiday in 1980.\n\n\"I can imagine that it will take a lot of tries for the state to include another holiday,\" said Boggis, adding that it might take the state \"just as long\" as it took for MLK Day. \"But I think the fight will continue because it's really important for us to recognize and celebrate freedom. New Hampshire is that 'Live Free or Die' state so, you know, we will just keep trying.\"\n\nVermont became the latest state to make Juneteenth a legal holiday on May 30. Juneteenth is currently recognized as an official state holiday in over half of the US and a holiday or observance in all 50 states.\n\nRep. Latha Mangipudi, D-Nashua, told other representatives at the executive session that making the day an official holiday in New Hampshire is \"something to look at down the line.\"\n\n\"At least I'm glad that we acknowledged Juneteenth as a day of recognizing the contribution the African American and Black community have done in the history,\" said Mangipudi. \"I respect the committee's due diligence on how it's done, but it's to be coming down the line.\"\n\nOfficial holiday or not, celebrations continue in New Hampshire.

They fled the racist and economically discriminatory practices of Jim Crow, joining the earliest waves of the Great Black Migration. My great-great-uncle, Grandison Kelley, served in the 122nd Colored Regiment Infantry, organized in Louisville on December 31, 1864. His regiment arrived in Texas in June 1865, when Major General Gordon Granger and Union troops arrived to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation, ensuring the constitutional rights and dignity of Black Americans -- an event we now celebrate as Juneteenth. My great-great-uncle's name is on the African American Civil War Memorial in Washington, D.C.\n\nFor Black Americans descended from those who survived and resisted chattel slavery, historical relational connections like these aren't uncommon. Our families have always been active participants -- not mere spectators -- in Juneteenth. While it marks the day in 1865 when Union troops informed enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, of their freedom, Juneteenth must also serve as a historical marker, denoting where we've been and where we must go.\n\nJuneteenth is part of a growing number of Black holidays to enter America's national identity. Memorial Day, recognized for honoring military service deaths, has roots in the Black community. In 1865, formerly enslaved individuals in Charleston, South Carolina, commemorated Union soldiers by giving them proper burials and holding a parade. This act of remembrance by Black Americans laid the foundation for Memorial Day.\n\nAcross the nation, communities are finalizing their Juneteenth programs with speakers, activities, food, and promotions. But as our democracy faces multi-faceted attacks, we must ensure Juneteenth doesn't become an idyllic, empty celebration, as some have sought to render the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday. While recognizing our progress, we must also get serious about the ongoing efforts to roll back democracy -- from limiting education on accurate history and diverse perspectives in schools to undermining voting rights and access.\n\nDespite the relentless attacks on our multiracial democracy, hope is not lost. Our ancestors never surrendered their dream for a brighter tomorrow. We must push forward with the same belief in the importance of freedom. This is why Juneteenth matters so much.\n\nJuneteenth is less a celebration and more a wake-up call for the necessity of organizing to prevent the erosion of rights, liberty, and fairness. This year, it coincides with the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act, and the 70th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. That's why this year Juneteenth should remind us to build on our aspirations and hopes for the future.\n\nBuilding on Juneteenth means embracing radical pluralism, a core part of Black America's radical project for inclusive democracy. Radical pluralism champions inclusivity, diversity, and power building, rejecting conventional Left/Right political paradigms. It emphasizes inclusion, belonging, and opportunity over exclusion, othering, and discrimination. By countering systems of white supremacy and combating white nationalism, radical pluralism aims to foster an equitable, just, and democratic society recognizing the voices and needs of marginalized communities.\n\nThe southern-driven civil rights movement of the 1950s and '60s delivered on behalf of the Black radical project, securing national policies addressing racial segregation, non-discriminatory access in education, employment, housing, and voting rights. These hard-won notions of fairness, equity, and opportunity set our country on the path towards authentic multiracial democracy. But freedom must be defended, and victories can never be taken for granted. Now it is our turn.\n\nToday, inequitable redistricting processes hinder voters of color from electing their candidates of choice. Numerous state measures make it harder for Black communities to vote, as do felony disenfranchisement laws. The right to vote must be vociferously protected.\n\nMoreover, we must acknowledge the ongoing violence and systemic injustices disproportionately affecting Black Americans. The more than 1.63 million excess Black deaths compared with White Americans highlight the urgent need for systemic change. Police killings reached record highs in 2023, 10 years after the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. These alarming figures demand continued activism to protect Black lives.\n\nAs we commemorate Juneteenth, we must continue to drive social and economic justice movements toward true equity and belonging. Our ancestors did not endure slavery, terror lynchings, Jim Crow, and racial subjugation for us to drop the ball. Juneteenth reminds us of the promises we must keep to those who came before and those who will follow.\n\nHarriet Tubman's words resonate loudly: \"If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the torches in the woods, keep going. If there's shouting after you, keep going. Don't ever stop. Keep going. If you want a taste of freedom, keep going.\" Slavery today may look different, but we cannot rest until we are free in every sense of the word. Juneteenth grounds July 4 as real and valid for all of us, especially Black and Indigenous people.\n\nJuneteenth is far more important than what we eat, wear, or do with our day off. We must honor the sacrifice of others and organize in their honor. This is our duty today and always.\n\nEric K.

Celebrated every year on June 19, it dates back to June 19, 1865, when Major Gen. Gordon Granger enforced the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas. It's often referred to as the longest-running African-American holiday and America's second Independence Day.\n\nAfter the fall of Richmond on April 2, 1865, and the surrender of Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia to Gen. Ulysses Grant at Appomattox Court House a week later, Confederate commanders were on their own to surrender their commands to Union forces. Not until 16 months after Appomattox, on Aug. 20, 1866, did President Andrew Johnson formally declare an end to the war.\n\nThe origins of Juneteenth celebrations trace back to 1866, beginning with community gatherings in Texas. These early observances spread across the South among newly freed Black people and their descendants. The Great Migration helped spread these celebrations nationwide, while the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s saw a temporary eclipse in observance as the focus shifted to nonviolent protests.\n\nEvidence of America's history of enslavement, segregation and racial oppression remains visible in the landscapes that surround us across our nation. For the most part, these \"ghosts\" are unseen and unnoticed, hidden in plain sight behind a veil of banality and further obscured by our own ignorance.\n\nGhosthunters will want to look carefully at the southeast corner of Virginia Street and Second here in Seattle. Forget all assumptions, turn on your curiosity and really open your eyes. Wonder about the purpose of that black double door across Virginia, just east of the corner.\n\nSeparate theater entrances for people of color were not limited to the states of the former Confederacy. The Moore Theatre is Seattle's oldest operating theater, having opened in December 1907. While much of its architecture was innovative, it maintained the painful tradition of forcing all nonwhite patrons to enter through a side door and slog up several steep flights of stairs to the isolated second balcony. Few people strolling past this enigmatic doorway in downtown Seattle realize that it is a vestige of segregation.\n\nJuneteenth gained federal recognition in 2021 when President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act into law, making it the first new federal holiday since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was established in 1983.\n\nThe roots of Juneteenth lie in President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, announced on Sept. 22, 1862, and effective Jan. 1, 1863. This proclamation promised freedom to enslaved people in the Confederate states. However, its enforcement relied heavily on the advance of Union troops, which was inconsistent in Texas. As the Civil War unfolded, emancipation came at different times across the Southern United States, with significant celebrations, often called Jubilees, held on various dates. When freedom finally arrived in Texas in 1865, the joy and relief among the formerly enslaved people were profound. This date has since become a day of national commemoration, celebrating the end of slavery and the ongoing struggle for equality.\n\nThe emancipation of Texas' enslaved population, many of whom had been brought to the state by fleeing planters from the East, culminated with Gen. Granger's arrival that day in Galveston. His order, enforced by over 2,000 federal troops, nullified all Confederate laws in Texas and informed the people that all enslaved individuals were free, emphasizing absolute equality of personal rights and property between former enslavers and the enslaved.\n\nAs we recognize Juneteenth, it is not only a time for celebration but also a moment for reflection. It reminds us of the resilience and contributions of African Americans throughout history. It is a day to educate ourselves about the past and inspire continued efforts toward justice and equality. Juneteenth is a powerful testament to the enduring spirit of freedom and the ongoing journey toward a more inclusive and equitable society.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Granger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gordon Granger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appomattox_Court_House_National_Historical_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appomattox Court House National Historical Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Northern_Virginia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army of Northern Virginia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Petersburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Siege of Petersburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Appomattox_Court_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battle of Appomattox Court House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulysses S.

It has been updated for 2024.\n\nJune 19th is called Juneteenth. Until President Biden declared it a national holiday in 2021, it was not widely known or understood outside the black community.\n\nJuneteenth is the oldest commemoration in the United States celebrating of the end of slavery. It is not, as many think, the anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Lincoln. That was January 1, 1863.\n\nHISTORY OF JUNETEENTH\n\nWord of emancipation marking the end of slavery was slow to reach parts of the U.S. not deeply embroiled in the Civil War. In fact, it wasn't until 1865 that word reached Texas. Major General Gordon Granger and his regiment of Union soldiers landed at Galveston, Texas, on June 19th with news that the Civil War had ended and that all blacks were free.\n\nIf you do the math, you'll find that Major General Granger brought the news of freedom to Texas a full two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation was signed. Reasons for the long delay vary from deliberate and intentional to accidental and a result of poor communication.\n\nGranger read aloud General Order Number 3 which said, \"The people of Texas are informed that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired laborer.\"\n\nNews of freedom from slavery was met with every emotion from shock to joy to disbelief and skepticism. Some freed black slaves stayed in Texas, while others left in search of family members or a better life in neighboring states.\n\nMODERN JUNETEENTH CELEBRATIONS\n\nJuneteenth celebrations waned over the years until the rise of the Civil Rights movement a century later. After the Poor Peoples March to Washington, DC in 1968, many blacks went back to their communities and initiated Juneteenth celebrations.\n\nJuneteenth became an official Texas state holiday in 1980 largely through the efforts of state legislator Al Edwards of Houston. This marked the first emancipation celebration that was granted official state recognition.\n\nThere's even a Juneteenth flag. Originally created by Ben Haith in 1997, the present version was first flown in 2000. The red, white, and blue colors with the star symbol in the center represent freedom and the end of slavery.\n\nOnce largely an African American holiday, coordinators of modern Juneteenth celebrations seek to bring in all members of the local community for educational purposes. The holiday is often observed with speeches, cookouts, parades, and parties.\n\nAmerican history is complex. Recognizing the intricacies and nuances of our diverse shared histories, I believe, makes us a stronger nation. While so many people are trying to tear us apart and divide us into polarized groups that want to destroy each other, we should be embracing what we all have in common. We are all Americans.\n\nGod bless America.\n\nImage from: en.wikipedia.org", "source": {"uri": "independentsentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.independentsentinel.com"}, "authors":

(WAVY) - June 19 is Juneteenth. The date commemorates when the last enslaved people in the United States learned of their freedom on June 19, 1865 in Galveston, Texas.\n\nThe holiday is also known as \"Emancipation Day\", \"Freedom Day\", and more.\n\nWhile 2024 marks the fourth year of Juneteenth as a federal holiday, it's been celebrated by states, communities and individuals for decades.\n\nTexas declared June 19 a state holiday starting in 1980, calling it \"Emancipation Day in Texas\". Other southern states followed suit including Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma and more.\n\n\"Juneteenth was originally one of the many celebratory holidays that black Americans, they created and engaged in after the civil war to one, celebrate the end of the war, two, to celebrate the ending of slavery, and three, to express to the rest of the country they desire to be American citizens, full-fledges American citizens with equal rights,\" said Marvin Chiles, Ph.D., an assistant professor of African American history at Old Dominion University.\n\nChiles says that is where the foundation of Juneteenth began. Originally, there were many different holidays celebrated for freedom. Juneteenth was more of a Deep South tradition. In Virginia, Chiles says the day was called \"Emancipation Day.\"\n\n\"It wasn't really until the 1960s, 1970s that the Juneteenth one spread,\" Chiles said.\n\nDuring that time is when the holiday began to grow into the rest of the country. That growth was brought about by black historical organizations, black Greek life organizations and historically black colleges.\n\nThen eventually, white-run organizations and interracial organizations joined in, like historical organizations and racial reconciliation groups.\n\n\"[They] began to really push for Juneteenth to be recognized and celebrated as an American holiday,\" Chiles said.\n\nWhen Chiles speaks to people about Juneteenth, he shares the message that it is a day for all Americans to come together.\n\nHe says people should realize and acknowledge that July 4th is an important date as the birth of the country, and Juneteenth is the date when all people's freedoms, spoken about in the Declaration of Independence, could start to come to fruition.\n\n\"If you love to celebrate July 4th, you've got to celebrate Juneteenth,\" Chiles said.\n\nChiles spoke more about the holiday, the meaning here in Hampton Roads and more in the conversation.

Best Dishes To Enjoy on US Federal Holiday.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, during the American Civil War, announcing the freedom of almost three million people who had been held as slaves in the Confederate States. But it would take more than two years for African Americans in Texas to learn of the incident. Confirming the end of the war and the liberation of all enslaved people, Union forces under Officer Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865.\n\nThe first official Juneteenth festivities were held in Texas the following year on June 19. Prayer gatherings and spiritual singing were part of the original celebrations, and participants dressed in new garments to symbolise their recently acquired freedom. After a short while, African Americans began commemorating the day annually in other states as well. However, Juneteenth was not recognised as a federal holiday until President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act in June 2021. So, to mark Juneteenth 2024, we have created a list of inspiring Juneteenth quotes, powerful sayings and HD images to honour freedom and abolishment of slavery.\n\nQuote Reads: \"Struggle Is a Never-Ending Process.

The pronouncement came through executive decree, declaring their freedom, a proclamation that would forever be commemorated as Juneteenth.\n\nInitially met with skepticism and disbelief, the news slowly disseminated among the enslaved population, igniting a wave of jubilation and reflection.\n\nFor those who had endured the shackles of bondage, Juneteenth symbolized the dawn of a new era, promising liberation and the long-awaited realization of their inherent rights.\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has evolved into a day of remembrance and celebration, signifying not only the end of slavery in the United States but also the resilience and perseverance of the Black community. It serves as a poignant reminder of the struggles endured and the progress made toward equality and justice.\n\nIn modern times, Juneteenth is observed with various commemorations, including community gatherings, parades, and educational events, highlighting the significance of this historic milestone.\n\nWhile its observance was initially confined to Texas, Juneteenth has gradually gained recognition across the nation, reaffirming its status as a pivotal moment in American history.\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Monday, June 10, 2024, marked the upcoming Juneteenth holiday with a concert on the White House lawn, striking a celebratory note even as he warned of GOP-led efforts to roll back rights for Black Americans.\n\nBiden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, and dozens of federal and state lawmakers gathered on the South Lawn for a concert that featured performances by Kirk Franklin, Gladys Knight, Trombone Shorty, Doug E. Fresh, and Patti Labelle.\n\nDespite its significance, Juneteenth remains a day tinged with the complexities of the past and the ongoing pursuit of racial equality. While progress has been made since that fateful day in 1865, systemic injustices and disparities persist, underscoring the continued relevance of Juneteenth in contemporary discourse.\n\nAs the nation reflects on the legacy of Juneteenth, it serves as an opportunity to acknowledge the triumphs and tribulations of the past while renewing commitments to fostering a more inclusive and equitable society. It is a day to honor the resilience of those who fought for freedom and to recommit to the ongoing pursuit of justice for all.", "source": {"uri": "njtoday.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJTODAY.NET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racial equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_E._Fresh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug E.

It's one that reminds us that for freedom to truly exist, it's not enough to be named -- it must be lived,\" Wu said.\n\nIn Massachusetts there are many different ways to celebrate.\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts in Boston is offering free admission, the Harambee Learning and Cultural Center will hold a celebration in Brockton with keynote speakers, music, and entertainment, and the Concord Museum is holding a Juneteenth family program with traditional West African performances.\n\nAs Juneteenth is a federal holiday, banks and post offices are closed. Most chain stores and restaurants will be open, including Walmart, Target, Starbucks, and McDonalds.\n\nEven though the post office is closed, UPS and FedEx pickup and delivery services are available.\n\nThe National Park Service is waiving all entry fees Wednesday. Although Juneteenth officially became a federal holiday in 2021, this year is the first time it will be a free entry day at U.S. National Parks. While entry will be free, fees will remain in effect for parking and activities like camping and fishing.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television. All Rights Reserved.

Al Edwards, the \"Father of Juneteenth,\" masterminded the legislative victory.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who signed Juneteenth into law as a federal holiday in 2021, names Rep. Edwards in the 2024 Juneteenth Day of Observance proclamation. Biden notes that Edwards \"authored the bill\" that made Juneteenth a statewide holiday in Texas. It was that legislation and the advocacy of Edwards, Lee and others that expanded the holiday to states across the nation.\n\nEdwards, who represented parts of Houston in the state legislature for over 30 years, dedicated his political career to making Juneteenth a federal holiday. Through his nonprofit Juneteenth USA and work as chairman and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee Black Caucus, Edwards was resolute on making his dream a reality.\n\nDuring a 2007 interview with The History Makers, he said, \"We will make it a national holiday,\" adding, \"If God leaves breath in my body and people keep working like they're working.\" Unfortunately, his health declined following a car accident in 2014 and he passed in 2020, just one year before Biden signed the bill.\n\nAl Edwards II, Jason Edwards and Alana Edwards-Holloway, are now carrying the baton of their late father's organization and aim to keep his name and legacy alive.\n\n\"This was his dream, and this was his contribution to America as a legislator,\" Jason Edwards told theGrio after attending the White House's Juneteenth concert celebration. Jason Edwards said, \"From a historical standpoint, he deserves his flowers.\"\n\nThe quest to federalize the Juneteenth holiday was not an easy one for Al Edwards, who literally ran for office in 1978 with that mission in mind. Before the holiday ultimately spread to 45 states, the lawmaker faced opposition at home, particularly from some white Texans.\n\n\"People were leaving red soda on his desk on the Statehouse floor to poke fun at him, and Black folks were telling him that he shouldn't do it because it was bringing up old history,\" recalled Jason Edwards.\n\nIn 1979, Al Edwards was compelled to make a trade-off with a fellow Texas legislator who opposed making Juneteenth an official state holiday.\n\n\"He had to support a lot of things that were unsavory,\" shared Jason Edwards, who recalled his father's story about a state senator who said, \"I can't bring your Black holiday to my district.\" When Rep. Edwards pushed to negotiate, he was asked to support a bill commemorating the Sons of the Confederacy. He reluctantly agreed.\n\n\"He was glad he did it, because at the end of the day, both were factually true. It definitely didn't make him feel good, but he wanted to win the war, and not the battle,\" said Jason Edwards.\n\nFollowing Texas' adoption of Juneteenth as a statewide holiday, Rep. Edwards used his own funds to jumpstart the Juneteenth USA national campaign and organization, including refinancing his home. He aimed to make Juneteenth a nationwide holiday by advocating and supporting other state legislators who adopted versions of his Texas bill.\n\n\"He knew that Juneteenth wouldn't pass federally, like Martin Luther King's holiday did, because the states didn't like that,\" said Jason Edwards, noting that some states didn't adopt MLK Day early on. \"Dad knew it had to be state by state. Being a state legislator, he understood how that system worked.\"\n\nJason Edwards told theGrio it was a full circle moment to see his father's name in the White House history books for the very thing he dedicated his life and career to achieving. Sitting in the front row with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris was particularly gratifying as they celebrated Juneteenth on the White House South Lawn earlier this month. He said it was \"absolutely wonderful\" to see the president and vice president highlight what Al Edwards, Opal Lee, and others have \"done for the country and for Black folks.\" He added, \"It was just truly a memorable night all the way around.\"\n\nAs millions of Americans will be off from work for the federal holiday, Jason Edwards noted that many will get the chance to reflect on the history of Juneteenth and why it is celebrated - just as his father always intended.\n\n\"He wanted America to take a moment every year to recognize our ancestors and their impact on the country,\" he said. \"America has to not turn its face away from American slavery.\"\n\nAnd while many Americans may not like celebrating a holiday that commemorates America's dark history, Jason Edwards said it's necessary -- no matter how uncomfortable it might be. He added, \"Let's lean in on our history and let it give a guide to why we are where we are today.\"", "source": {"uri": "thegrio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheGrio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gerren_keith_gaynor@thegrio.com", "name": "Gerren Keith Gaynor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Edwards_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Edwards (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Edwards_(speedway_rider)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Edwards (speedway rider)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opal Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr._Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin Luther King Jr. Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California State Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments_and_Legislatures", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Parliaments and Legislatures", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Historians", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Historians", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1541009511-e1718747218923.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Just days before the 2021 celebration, on June 16, President Joe Biden signed a bill passed by Congress that made the date a federal holiday. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia recognize Juneteenth as a public holiday.\n\nThe holiday was named after a contraction of \"June Nineteenth.\"\n\nAs a federal holiday, many government offices, buildings and services -- including mail services -- will be closed or have different hours of operation.\n\nSince 1865, Juneteenth has been marked in Galveston, Texas, where Union soldiers arrived to free the remaining slaves.

This holiday commemorates the June 19, 1865 emancipation of enslaved people in Texas, who had not been told of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation two and a half years earlier.\n\n\"This is an opportunity for the community to come together and celebrate the progress that has been made since Juneteenth, but also recognize the work that still needs to be done to achieve true equality while bringing more awareness by parading through the streets of Evanston,\" Hendricks said.\n\nThe parade stepped off at 11 a.m. from Lee Street and Dodge Avenue just north of the Robert Crown Community Center.\n\nParade Grand Marshall and Second Ward Alderman Krissie Harris was joined by the ETHS Marching Band, the Evanston Creative Dance Team, the South Shore Drill Team and The Jesse White Tumblers along with floats, walking groups, marching bands & cars.\n\nThe parade ended the Civic Center at Dodge and Simpson at noon, where the festivities continued at Ingram Park with Juneteenth celebration, coordinated by Artistic Director of the Fleetwood-Jourdain Theatre Tim Rhoze. The event featured live performances from noon until 4 p.m., by The McNary Experience, spoken word by Team at Ease, D-Mix Funk & Soul featuring Donovan Mixon, and others with local food vendors, artisans, speakers and children's play area.\n\n\"This event is always about paying homage to the end of what would become an American institution that stole people from their homelands of Africa, enslaved them, tore families apart and built the world's most successful economy achieved from the free labor of these enslaved and tortured Africans,\" Rhoze said. \"We commemorate with this in mind, Juneteenth marks the birth of a new era in America, a true independence day.\"\n\nNew this year, special awards honored individuals and organizations who have made a positive impact on the Evanston community in relation to Juneteenth.\n\nThe Freedom Trailblazer Award given to Julia Ferguson; the Shorefront Legacy center was awarded the Heritage Preservation Award; the Unity Champion Award given to Tim Rhoze, the Juneteenth Legacy Award to Hecky Powell and the Emancipation Excellence Award to a parade participant or float that best embodies the spirit of Juneteenth, celebrating freedom, unity and the journey towards equality.\n\nHendricks says the primary goal for all Juneteenth festivities is to spread awareness and to preserve the history of the holiday.\n\n\"We are building a Juneteenth celebration in Evanston with a solid foundation, one that will last for years to come,\" Hendricks said. \"Like our Fourth of July parade, we want our Juneteenth parade to survive for the next 100

It's for all Americans\n\nJUNE 19, 2024 7:00 AM ET\n\nBy Michel Martin', Suzanne Nuyen\n\nWhy Juneteenth is for all Americans\n\nOpal Lee, shown earlier this month, is celebrating this week's passage of legislation making Juneteenth a federal holiday. President Biden signed the bill Thursday.\n\nAmanda McCoy/Fort Worth Star-Telegram/Tribune News Service via Getty Images [from 2021]\n\nThis essay was written by Michel Martin, Morning Edition and Up First host\n\nConfession: I had never heard of Juneteenth until I came to D.C., after college. A colleague and friend who was dating a guy from Texas told me about it. Even then, I thought it was a regional thing, like Mardi Gras -- which is to say: not to be tampered with, watered down or interpreted by people not in the know, if you get my drift.\n\nYou can see it. It commemorates the day federal troops arrived to enforce The Emancipation Proclamation in Texas some two years after it was issued. More broadly, though, it celebrates the end of chattel slavery. To my mind, it celebrates the beginning of true freedom because -- as moral philosophers have long known -- no one is free until everyone is because oppression ensnares the oppressor as well as the oppressed. Anyone who has ever been in a toxic relationship knows that.\n\nThat is one reason the magnificent Opal Lee, the Fort Worth native known as the grandmother of Juneteenth, worked so hard and so long to see Juneteenth become a federal holiday. A white mob burned down her family home in 1939. She became an educator and an activist and saw the day become a federal holiday last year. She told her local station KTVT \"It's not a Texas thing or a Black thing. It's an American thing.\"\n\nGo celebrate.", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opal_Lee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opal Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth_Star-Telegram", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardi_Gras", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mardi Gras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Edition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morning Edition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTVT", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KTVT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppression", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oppression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism_and_Devolution", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Federalism and Devolution", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Native_American", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Native American", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Celebrity_Memorabilia", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Celebrity Memorabilia", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 65}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 63, "textEnd": 70}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Beginning Tuesday, you may notice a new flag flapping in the wind.\n\nIn honor of the third anniversary of Juneteenth becoming a state holiday, Lt. Gov. Diana Primavera and other members of Colorado's legislature raised the official Juneteenth flag at the capitol.\n\nJuneteenth commemorates the day in 1865 when the enslaved people in Galveston, Texas found out they had been freed -- two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. Along with the holiday comes a special flag.\n\nAccording to CNN, the banner has several symbols that represent the end of slavery in the U.S.\n\nThe Juneteenth flag consists of the colors, red, white and blue, a star, a burst and an arc.\n\nPer CNN, the flag was created by Ben Haith in 1997, the founder of the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Then, Boston-based illustrator Lisa Jeanne Graf brought the flag to life.\n\nThe white star in the middle of the flag represents Texas, also known as \"The Lone Star State,\" where the last remaining slaves were informed they were free. However, according to the creator of the flag, the star also represents the freedom of Black Americans in all 50 states.\n\nThe burst outlining the star is inspired by a nova, or a new star, according to CNN. This represents a new beginning for Black Americans in the U.S.\n\nThe arc background represents a new horizon and opportunities for Black Americans. Finally, the colors correlate to those of the American flag as a reminder to the slaves and their descendants that they were and are Americans, according to CNN.\n\nIn 2022, Gov. Jared Polis signed Senate Bill 22-139, making Juneteenth an official Colorado holiday. On Tuesday, Primavera raised the flag.\n\n\"Today, as we raise the Juneteenth flag, I am proud to commemorate this important American holiday. On Juneteenth, we celebrate and honor the joy that this holiday has embodied in the Black community for more than 150 years. This is an important reminder that we must continue working together to protect and expand our freedoms, and build a Colorado for all,\" said Primavera.\n\nJuneteenth is observed on June 19 and is also recognized as a federal holiday.", "source": {"uri": "kdvr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX31 Denver KDVR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_whitley@kdvr.com", "name": "Morgan Whitley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth_flag", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth flag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Haith", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Haith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Polis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Polis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 44}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Anarchism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Anarchism", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/College", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/College", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Six_Flags", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Six Flags", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://kdvr.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/06/AP20169614745551.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 2195, "textEnd": 2202}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Aside from the recognizably dry and flat lands of California's Central Valley, the scene was interchangeable with family reunions, holidays and even summer trips to visit my great-grandmother in Jackson, Miss.\n\n\"Homecoming, church picnics, fish fries -- they all share the same music, food and cadence as Juneteenth,\" explained Nicole Taylor, author of \"Watermelon and Red Birds: A Cookbook for Juneteenth and Black Celebrations,\" the first Juneteenth cookbook released by a major publishing house.\n\nThe holiday marks June 19, 1865, when Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, to inform all enslaved people within the state -- estimated to be 25,000 -- that they had been freed by President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, nearly 2\u00bd years after the order was given.\n\nThe first Juneteenth celebrations were recorded in the state of Texas in 1866, with descriptions of family and church gatherings featuring tablescapes of vibrant summer fruits, fried fish and chicken and poundcake. In the years to follow, festivities spread throughout Southern states and eventually made their way to the Midwest and both coasts.\n\nThough the holiday has been celebrated for more than 150 years, it wasn't until 2021 that Juneteenth became a federal holiday. As the history becomes more widely known, treasured traditions have resurfaced, including the consumption of red-colored foods including watermelon, barbecued meats and strawberry cake.\n\nThere are different ideas around the significance of eating red foods on Juneteenth. Some believe that early celebrants simply worked with easily accessible and in-season ingredients that happened to be red: watermelon, strawberries, beans and fried or smoked meats. Others say that it honors the bloodshed and suffering of enslaved ancestors.\n\nFor Taylor, \"I like to go into my experience around the color red and being a Black woman raised in the American South. Growing up, the pews in my church were red. All of the women that I admired, they were members of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and their color was red. There was so much red around me, and it always meant power. It always meant royalty and celebration. Even going back to West Africa, the transatlantic slave trade brought the ritual of drinking sorrel, or what some people would call hibiscus. For Black people across the diaspora, that ritual has been with us forever. It's inside of us.\"\n\nBut modern Juneteenth spreads can be adaptive and interpretive.\n\nThere are plenty of places to purchase red foods, but in the spirit of Juneteenth, endeavor to visit some of L.A.'s Black-owned restaurants and markets -- and don't just limit that support to one day. Juneteenth falls on a Wednesday this year, but the essence of its celebrations reverberates through any gathering that's centered in joy, community and liberation.\n\n\"Anytime you're intentional about not working, about turning your phone off and playing music -- you're bringing the Juneteenth spirit,\" Taylor said.\n\nHere are 14 Black-owned restaurants and markets across L.A. to get red foods and drinks -- spanning fruit punch, fried chicken, red velvet cake and more -- for Juneteenth and all year long.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles

Subscribe to unlock unlimited access to all our coverage and analysis.\n\nIn its fourth year as a federal holiday, Juneteenth has arrived; it's a day that is observed to commemorate the freedom of enslaved Black people in the U.S. So much historical significance comes with Juneteenth, yet since the George Floyd murder, there has been a frenzy of stereotypical marketing campaigns and communications by different brands trying to make a quick buck or grow their customer base.\n\nA big oversight in our industry is that brands feel the need to prove that they are a part of every single social cause.\n\nDo everyone a favor: Pause. Reflect before you hit send on that Juneteenth statement. To avoid embarrassing mistakes, below are the top do's and don'ts for appropriately observing Juneteenth personally and professionally.\n\nOne of the biggest faux pas companies make year after year on Juneteenth is using it as a jumping-off point to check in on Black talent.\n\nBlack employees know it's not about Juneteenth. It's about the lack of actions the 11 other months out of the year. When I worked for corporate America, I was hardly supported and would be ignored by my managers. But the second it became Black History Month or Juneteenth, I would suddenly have back-to-back meetings booked on my calendar by absentee bosses to see \"how I'm doing.\" Ditch this all together. It is not only uncomfortable but also incredibly disingenuous.\n\nRelated Video\n\nShow support all the time. That's what matters. Also, if you want to organize an event around Juneteenth, that's great. But please refrain from expecting and turning to your Black team members to organize it. This is not a photo opportunity to show diversity within the company.\n\nMany companies communicating and posting about Juneteenth still don't know its history. This is almost like raising your hand in class to show how smart you are, and then answering the question incorrectly. It throws off everyone around you. You're only setting yourself up to fail.\n\nAvoid going into a full-blown preachy mode to colleagues, customers and friends. If you haven't committed to doing all you can professionally and personally to amplify and back the Black community, then it's best not to post anything on Juneteenth. Yes, you read that right -- sit this one out. The time to take meaningful action is year-round.\n\nBrands successfully jump into storytelling mode when they are in a position to educate on the topic. Hold on to that statement, that Slack message and the campaign that is essentially a \"learning series\" until you truly absorb the meaning of Juneteenth.\n\nJuneteenth is a chance for us all to try to improve and do better.\n\nStart small. Lofty, impossible promises will only make matters worse and have little progress. Don't follow in the footsteps of what brands did four years ago with huge claims for Black people that went nowhere. You want to ensure you can follow through on what you hope to accomplish.\n\nThis can be as simple as buying Black-owned products, outsourcing Black-owned businesses, eating out at a Black-owned restaurant, donating to Black-owned charities, hiring Black talent and even referring your Black colleague to senior positions of power. You'd be surprised by how far these acts can go.\n\nInternally, companies can create actionable and strategic roadmaps that audit systems and leverage data to show how racism is perpetuated subconsciously. This can take shape in company surveys to illuminate unconscious bias that may be feeding systemic racism. Numbers don't lie. This should go deeper than implementing seasonal DEI programs that involve and hold leadership accountable to becoming more active allies to BIPOC communities.\n\nRemember, Juneteenth is the time to start creating lasting equity, amplification and opportunity for Black people while also recognizing the disparities Black communities face. Whatever you do or decide not to do, just ensure it is respectful and goes beyond one day of the year.", "source": {"uri": "adweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Adweek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-owned_businesses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black-owned businesses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_History_Month", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black History Month"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Implicit stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Institutional racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outsourcing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Blackpowder", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Blackpowder", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_and_Society/Ethnicity", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business and Society/Ethnicity", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://static-prod.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/sit-out-juneteenth-2024-600x315.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

Let's come together to honor the past, embrace the present, and build a future where every voice is heard and every talent shines.\n\nFollowing another successful Cisco Live! experience, I am still in awe of the many conversations I have had surrounding the importance of inclusion and pursuing purposeful work that builds business values. Reflecting on the importance of this upcoming Juneteenth holiday and what it means to me, Cisco's purpose to power an inclusive future for all echoes as we sponsor the Juneteenth Atlanta Parade and Music Festival for the third year in a row.\n\nWhy we celebrate Juneteenth\n\nJuneteenth, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day, marks the moment on June 19, 1865, two and a half years after the Emancipation Proclamation, when the last enslaved African Americans in Galveston, Texas, were informed of their freedom. This day serves as a pivotal point in African American history and represents a profound testament to the enduring spirit of a people who have tirelessly advocated for freedom and equality.\n\nFor me, Juneteenth is a celebration of freedom and a testament to our shared humanity. As I think about my journey as the Chief Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer of Cisco, I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge how my father's journey contributed to making me who I am today. He immigrated to the United States from the Bahamas in the 1940s with only a sixth-grade education and a superhuman work ethic. He often worked multiple low wage jobs, all while enduring the harsh realities of racial segregation and stereotypes. Despite having limited opportunities, his faith, joy, and hope were boundless. The foundation of hard work and determination he instilled in my brothers and me played a tremendous role in all that I've accomplished so far.\n\nThis holiday serves as a time to celebrate the strength, resilience and determination of my own family and the families of those whose dreams were denied or deferred. Although rooted in African American history, Juneteenth's core values of freedom, resilience, and equality transcend cultural boundaries and resonate universally. Embracing it as a national celebration reinforces the idea that freedom and justice are not exclusive to any one group but are inherent rights for all.\n\nAmplifying Underrepresented Voices\n\nAs we celebrate Juneteenth, it is crucial to listen to and elevate the stories and experiences of African Americans and other marginalized groups.\n\nWe can do that by:\n\nA Call for Reflection and Action\n\nJuneteenth calls upon each of us to be change agents in the ongoing fight for equality and justice. Being a change agent requires a commitment to continuous learning and unlearning, recognizing our own biases, and actively working to dismantle them.

This holiday came to life two years after the Emancipation Proclamation was issued. This proclamation stated that \"all persons held as slaves\" within rebellious states \"are, and henceforward shall be free.\" The holiday was first celebrated in Texas on June 19, 1865 due to the fact that it took years for the Emancipation Proclamation news to reach that area of the country.\n\nThis day did not become a national holiday until 2021. And this year, it's the first time state employees in Alabama will have the holiday off.\n\nUniversity of Alabama associate professor George Daniels said the celebration of Juneteenth is important, but it is also important for people to know the history.\n\n\"The context for the celebration is the fact that people were not full citizens and there were conditions that were not the same for one group versus another group in the same country. Those issues are still concerns in 2024,\" Daniels said.\n\nThe celebration of Juneteenth did not come easily. \"A lot of effort, discussion, and debate\" is the reason the federal holiday is possible, he said.\n\nYou have to wonder why it took so much effort to make Juneteenth a national holiday. For that reason, Daniels said he believes there is a lot to learn from this holiday.\n\n\"It is more than festivals and having a day off work. It's about becoming aware and understanding the experiences of those who were formerly enslaved,\" Daniels said.\n\nEveryone is welcome to spread awareness.\n\n\"The awareness spreading shouldn't just come from those in the African American community,\" Daniels said. \"It should come from every American who makes him or herself a committee of one to learn 'What is Juneteenth? Why did it happen in the first place? Why do we have a celebration?' Share that information with others.\"\n\nWhile Emancipation Day was in the 1800s, freedom and equality remained elusive in the U.S. until recent times. Even today it's still out of reach for many, Daniels said.\n\nThere will be a Living Legends event in Tuscaloosa Wednesday to celebrate and honor the holiday. This event is sponsored by the NCAAP. Participants will celebrate living legends in the area of civil rights and justice. This year's honoree is Dr. Samory Pruitt. He is the vice president for community affairs at the University of Alabama.", "source": {"uri": "wvua23.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WVUA23"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Daniels_(watchmaker)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George Daniels (watchmaker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Alabama", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NAACP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscaloosa,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuscaloosa, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Celebrity_Memorabilia", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Celebrity Memorabilia", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.wvua23.com/content/uploads/2024/06/g/u/juneteenth.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 43, "textEnd": 50}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 315, "textEnd": 322}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

HarrisonAs a young girl raised in the oldest Black city in Texas, June 19 was regarded as a day of jubilee in my family. Adults were home from work, there was no summer school, and everyone came together to enjoy one another and, of course, food. Like many families, we fired up the barbecue pit, poured up thick red punch in plastic cups, and unabashedly enjoyed that delicious red fruit-a symbol of the sweet freedom first tasted by the newly freed men and women.\n\nJuneteenth, as the day was known, was special not just for Black Texans, but for many Americans with ties to the southern state that had received the news of emancipation two and a half years late. And now that it is a federal holiday, Americans of all races and ethnicities are rewarded with another day off from employment and another opportunity to gather with loved ones.\n\nJuneteenth has joined the ranks of American holidays such as New Year's and Labor Day. But Juneteenth is more than just another day off.\n\nIt is an opportunity to reckon with our past, honor our present, and build a better future for our city, our state and our country.\n\nA Sacred Day of Remembrance\n\nJune 19 marks the day that Union soldiers arrived in Texas to enforce the almost three-year-old news that owning people as property was outlawed. While the actual decree did not magically guarantee liberty for all into the state, it did give birth to one of our country's greatest Freedom stories.\n\nEven after learning that slavery had been abolished, many slaveholders refused to honor the decree for fear of losing their wealth and power. Enslaved people had contributed greatly to slaveholders' success in business, arts and politics. Freedom undoubtedly meant a decline in the quality of life for those who relied on Black Americans for their livelihoods.\n\nAs a result, men and women who tried to act on their newly instated right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness were often denied their new rights, subjected to violence, or even killed. Still, Black Americans left slave quarters to establish freedmen's towns, communities that were built and inhabited by formerly enslaved Americans and offered the peace and prosperity that was denied to them by the rest of the country.\n\nJuneteenth reminds us of the men and women who endured terrorism and tyranny daily and still went on to build schools, create masterpieces, establish philanthropy, run for office, fight for our country and in many cases, sacrifice their lives to disrupt a country's inhumanitarian path and usher in a new regime marked by freedom. It is the day when, at least in theory, all men were free to enjoy the rights that America was founded upon in 1776.\n\nEndurance and Resilience\n\nPerhaps the most significant aspect of the holiday lies in its endurance. Juneteenth started as a celebration in a small community in Texas and has become a national holiday as a result of the story-telling and familial traditions linked to the day. Early versions of Juneteenth included reuniting families over food and games and reading important freedom documents to ensure that the significance of the occasion was not lost on future generations. It was this annual renewing of minds that preserved the collective memories of the atrocities of slavery and provided a testament for future generations to the strength of a people to transform something dark into a beacon of hope.\n\nToday, when our history is threatened by erasure, our communities are being dismantled by systemic disinvestment, and Black lives are being treated as worthless and expendable, Juneteenth can serve as a rallying cry for communal healing and collective action -- a revival of sorts of the spirit that built our communities in the first place.\n\nWhile there are many milestone days worth remembering when it comes to freedom in America, June 19 remains especially significant for its ability to help us learn from our past, acknowledge our present progress, and build a brighter future. It is more than just another occasion for offices to close or an arbitrary date on the calendar. June 19 is a sacred day and should be honored as such.\n\nLike Memorial Day, it should be revered for the men and women who lost their lives and liberties trying to enjoy a more perfect union.\n\nLike the 4th of July, we should celebrate Juneteenth as the day we actually declared that all people are free.\n\nView Portland and Seattle Juneteenth events here: Juneteenth 2024 Events in Portland and Seattle.\n\nSherreta R.

President Joe Biden signed the bill for the Juneteenth National Independence Day on June 17, 2021.\n\nEach year since then, the annual holiday offers millions of Americans a paid day off as it commemorates the day in 1865 when Majo. Gen. Gordon Granger gave over 250,000 enslaved people in Texas that they were free. This announcement followed two and a half years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863.\n\nAlthough banks and post offices will remain closed on Juneteenth in the wake of the historic celebration now identified as a federal holiday, some stores, restaurant chains and other establishments will be open on June 19. Here's our guide to what will be open and closed on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to USA Today, major restaurants like McDonald's, Dunkin', Wendy's, KFC and several others will be open. Moreover, primary stores such as Walmart, Costco and Target will also keep their doors unlocked. However, they may follow restricted holiday hours.

Days earlier, Montgomery had urged people via his campaign Facebook page to contact the city and \"ask them why they will not honor Juneteenth.\"\n\nMcDavid and council members noted during the meeting, however, that no agenda items related to Juneteenth have been suggested, voted on or otherwise considered in recent years.\n\n\"It was not brought up the last two years that I was here on the prior council, and then last year, it was not brought up with the new council,\" said council member John LeBlanc. He and Montgomery previously served together on the panel. Montgomery was elected in 2018; LeBlanc entered office in 2020.\n\nCouncil member James Graves was sympathetic to the desire to recognize Juneteenth but said he felt \"blindsided\" by the comments made at the meeting.\n\n\"I just don't want to be considered as part of the 'y'all' or whoever may be doing something wrong to somebody,\" he said.\n\nJuneteenth commemorates the ending of slavery in the United States. It's celebrated annually on June 19 -- the day in 1865 when federal troops arrived in Texas to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation, which had been signed two years earlier, and to deliver news that the Civil War had ended.\n\nAfter that day, an estimated 250,000 enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom and broke out in celebrations, starting the tradition of Juneteenth. It became a federal holiday more than 150 years later in 2021.\n\n\"The federal government has stated that we should honor Juneteenth, we should close our offices,\" Montgomery told the council. \"And here I am ... because y'all don't want to honor that day. That day is as important to us as the Fourth of July.\"\n\nHe noted that nearly half of Zachary's population is African American.\n\n\"I'm not asking you,\" Montgomery said. \"I'm telling you to do what's right. Do what's right for these 47% of these citizens in this city.\"\n\nMontgomery left the council chamber after speaking, but discussion of the issue was far from over. McDavid pulled out a printed copy of the NAACP letter, which was posted on the organization's Facebook page June 6 and is addressed to the mayor.\n\n\"We, the undersigned members of the NAACP Political Action Committee, are writing to express our deep concern and disappointment regarding the City of Zachary's recent decision not to honor Juneteenth as a federal holiday by closing city offices,\" the letter begins. \"This decision undermines the significance of Juneteenth and its place in our nation's history as a pivotal moment in the journey toward freedom and equality for African Americans.\"\n\nThe letter goes on to describe the significance and history of the holiday.\n\nMcDavid, waving his copy of the document, said he disagreed with the NAACP's assertions.\n\n\"First of all, we have not denied that nor was this brought in front of this council or anybody. I disagree with this. This is fake, lie, propaganda that's being put out there,\" he said. \"I don't agree with it. It's a proper way to come in here and say, 'OK, we'd like to put this on the council agenda.' Mr. Montgomery served four years as a councilman. He knows the procedures. He needs to do that.\"\n\nMcDavid said he had no objection to considering adding Juneteenth to the city holiday calendar.\n\n\"It's not a problem,\" he said. \"But don't lie and make up this nonsense right here that I disagree with. That's attacking my integrity as mayor.\"\n\nWhen conversation turned to what could be done to designate Juneteenth as a holiday in Zachary, the council realized it had limited options for 2024. The city's calendar of paid days off for employees and office closures is set each winter.\n\n\"It is too late for this year,\" City Attorney John Hopewell said.\n\nHe explained that changing the city's holiday calendar midyear and permitting employees to receive pay without completing work they were originally expected to do could amount to an illegal use of public funds.\n\nThe city recognizes 12 holidays. The schedule doesn't exactly match the 12 holidays observed by the federal government. For example, Zachary doesn't close for Juneteenth, George Washington's Birthday and Columbus Day, which are federal holidays.\n\nInstead, Hopewell said, Zachary offices are shuttered on Good Friday, Mardi Gras and a day before or after Christmas, depending on when the holiday falls. And employees get to take a day off for their birthdays.\n\nCouncil members also pondered recognizing Juneteenth with a proclamation similar to those that have been issued to honor awareness months and other events.\n\nBecause the discussion came up at the end of the meeting under an agenda item that allows speakers to address any topic but prohibits action except in the event of emergencies, the council didn't vote on any Juneteenth-related proposals.", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Subscribe here to get the newsletter delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.\n\nThis essay was written by Michel Martin, Morning Edition and Up First host\n\nConfession: I had never heard of Juneteenth until I came to D.C., after college. A colleague and friend who was dating a guy from Texas told me about it. Even then, I thought it was a regional thing, like Mardi Gras -- which is to say: not to be tampered with, watered down or interpreted by people not in the know, if you get my drift.\n\nYou can see it. It commemorates the day federal troops arrived to enforce The Emancipation Proclamation in Texas some two years after it was issued. More broadly, though, it celebrates the end of chattel slavery. To my mind, it celebrates the beginning of true freedom because -- as moral philosophers have long known -- no one is free until everyone is because oppression ensnares the oppressor as well as the oppressed. Anyone who has ever been in a toxic relationship knows that.\n\nThat is one reason the magnificent Opal Lee, the Fort Worth native known as the grandmother of Juneteenth, worked so hard and so long to see Juneteenth become a federal holiday. A white mob burned down her family home in 1939. She became an educator and an activist and saw the day become a federal holiday last year. She told her local station KTVT \"It's not a Texas thing or a Black thing. It's an American thing.\"\n\nGo celebrate.\n\nToday marks four years since Juneteenth became a federally recognized holiday. For families in Galveston, Texas, where the holiday originated, celebrations have been a mainstay for generations. Here's how residents will observe Juneteenth this year.\n\nThis week, activist Opal Lee received keys to a new house built on the same plot of land where her family's home once stood. It's been more than eight decades since it was vandalized and destroyed. Trinity Habitat for Humanity, Texas Capital and HistoryMaker Homes partnered to build the house and give it to Lee.

Regan Jones, a 10-year-old with an impressive step routine, took home the crown. (via WUGA)\n\nBoston's Poet Laureate Porsha Olayiwola considers Juneteenth both a celebration and a reminder of oppression. She reflects on the day with WBUR's Sharon Brody, shares some of her poems that resonate with the holiday's themes, and discusses how poetry can help people learn and heal.

Black Americans are no longer the focus.", "body": "If not our humanity, access to education nor reluctant police reform, Black Americans at the least are owed a Freedom Day that is indicative of our past, not a fabricated \"celebration\" that centers corporations and profit. Louisville has lost the heart of Juneteenth not even five years after it became a federal holiday.\n\nIt is disheartening that the Louisville Juneteenth Festival is not rooted in true community, but instead in the two notorious Ps: profit and pictures. The festival should be free with no tickets, no vendor fees and no corporations. But instead, Lynn Family Stadium will be hosting. If any, it should be a Black-owned business or one that is regularly in network with Black Louisville.\n\nAt the next cookout, ask your family when is the last time they visited Lynn Family Stadium or even played soccer. Which isn't to say Black people don't visit the stadium or play soccer; it is to say such partnerships should follow cultural engagement and traditions. This is a forced attempt at trying to blend two different communities when Juneteenth should be a day of Pan-Africanism. It is selling out in the name of PR.\n\nSimilarly, as inconvenient as slavery was, are we not owed a Freedom Day that inconveniences the work week? June 19 falls on a Wednesday this year, yet the festival is on June 15 because it is a Saturday. Again, our freedom is contingent on some outside factor.\n\nA Juneteenth festival true to Black liberation would be held on the day, no matter what logistical efforts lie ahead. Because that's how nonnegotiable and unwavering our freedom is.\n\nDon't whitewash Juneteenth: Black people shouldn't have to lose identity to promote holiday\n\nJuneteenth as a federal and now state holiday is humorous to say the least. White people having a paid day off on Juneteenth is not only the antithesis of the entire day, it represents a sinister cycle of America reluctantly giving Black Americans what we are owed, and only if white America can benefit from it.\n\nWe still struggle with housing, education, transportation and health because of the generational ignorance to racism. To pay white people on Juneteenth is a slap in the face to every Black American and the ancestors we come from. If these systems were so invested in helping Black communities, they would commit to that notion materially. They would put their money where their mouths are.\n\nBut we as Black Americans know better than to expect that.\n\nSo each year it'll get worse. More red and green will seep into marketing flyers. More \"partnerships\" will develop. More logos stamped on the backs of our shirts. More media fluff while allowing Louisville Metro Police Department and Jefferson County Public Schools to neglect us. More and more conditions on our freedom.\n\nJuneteenth is not an excuse for white corporations to \"partner\" with Black organizations in the name of \"diversity.\" But like Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Gay Pride, Juneteenth has been swept up by racial capitalism and spat back out to us at double the price and a fraction of the impact.\n\nNia Queen is a community organizer, creative and writer dedicated to justice and truth.

It's true that since Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay on June 19, 1865, and announced to more than 250,000 enslaved Black people that they were actually free, Juneteenth has been a staple of the Black Texan experience. But thanks to the Great Migration, Juneteenth festivities have been a presence in parks and backyards around the country for years.\n\n\"The very first time that I commemorated Juneteenth, I was in New York,\" says writer and author Nicole Taylor. More than 10 years ago, she found herself attending the festivities at a park in Brooklyn. Though she was raised in the South -- in Athens, Georgia -- and lived in Atlanta for 13 years before moving up North, growing up, \"I don't even think I heard the term Juneteenth,\" she says. However, in that tree-lined park in Brooklyn, as Black children rode horses and people celebrated freedom, Taylor was immediately inspired. \"It was a very simple, very nimble, yet proud and strong version of Black people doing their own thing on a Saturday,\" she recalls. \"That's what I remember most, is that things don't have to be big to be impactful.\"\n\nEvery year since, she has hosted or participated in a Juneteenth event somewhere in the country. Whether in New York, Georgia or Texas, she's sought to recreate for family and friends the Black joy she first witnessed more than a decade ago. A big part of that joy is food, which Taylor knows a lot about. A James Beard Award-nominated writer and cookbook author, she released her first work, The Up South Cookbook: Chasing Dixie in a Brooklyn Kitchen, in 2015. In 2017, her New York Times article about Juneteenth connected her name to the annual observance. Taylor soon found herself being asked to help bring a \"niche\" holiday into the mainstream consciousness. \"People started associating Juneteenth with me -- and then pretty much every year after that, I wrote about Juneteenth for some publication,\" she says.\n\nHer literary agent encouraged her to consider a cookbook based on the holiday. Though she initially had reservations, when the pandemic hit, she had a change of heart. The grief around the killing of George Floyd, as well as the uprisings in support of Black lives, made it all the more necessary to shed light on Black celebrations, especially in the midst of Black pain. \"I thought about how Black people's sorrow is often booked in with celebration. It reminds me of a Black repast, right? Somebody dies in your family, and for two or three days, everybody's gathering. Sometimes there are people you're meeting for the first time, or you haven't seen them in years. And you're all mourning, but it also turns into a joyful family reunion,\" she says. \"That is the most basic expression of Black people and Black Americans -- we take something that is so serious and sacred, and so sad, and we find a moment just to be with family and just to think about the goodness in people that we love.\"\n\nWhen Juneteenth was made a federal holiday by the Biden administration a year later, in June 2021, Taylor decided there was no better time to write a cookbook about Black America's June 19th traditions. Having left New York City during the pandemic to return to her roots in Athens, she began work on what would become Watermelon & Red Birds, an essential cookbook for the Juneteenth holiday, which was released on May 31 through Simon & Schuster.\n\nInspired by the creations of food writer Jessica Harris and chef Bryant Terry, Taylor crafted the first cookbook to celebrate America's \"second Independence Day.\" She highlights new and standard dishes eaten on the holiday, sharing the best tools, finest flavorful seasonings and most important pantry staples to create them. Every recipe is a fresh spin on traditional fare consumed at festivities year after year. For instance, for the signature red drink to symbolize the blood shed by our ancestors, she decided, \"Okay, I'm doing a whole chapter on red drinks.\" It includes a homemade \"Kool-Aid,\" a Maroon Margarita with a strawberry base, a savory Miso Bloody Mary and a sweet Afro Egg Cream with hibiscus tea, simple syrup, half-and-half and seltzer.\n\nAnother must at any Juneteenth gathering is something smokin'. \"You've got to have some kind of food on the grill,\" Taylor says, noting that it doesn't always have to be red meat. \"I didn't do a regular beef burger. I did a chicken burger, and I wanted to make sure the chicken burger was juicy. I chose that because you've got so many people now who aren't eating red meat.\"\n\nBut those who haven't sworn off red meat are still covered, as Taylor pays homage to Texas barbecue: \"I did a beef rib on the grill and a bunch of barbecue sauces, so people can kind of mix and match.\" She also includes mouthwatering grilling recipes for lamb chops with pitted apricot, a classic rib-eye steak and even oysters on the half shell.\n\nThere are also festival-inspired treats and desserts sure to please everyone. And she didn't forget the sides, including the controversial potato salad. \"I definitely had to touch on the potato salad,\" she notes, \"because 'Who made the potato salad?' is the first question everybody is going to ask when they start looking at it on Juneteenth.\"\n\nEverything is offered mindfully. For example, if you don't have access to a charcoal or gas grill, the meats can be made in an oven or on a stove top. Every category of food is introduced with a history lesson, a laugh, and all the information needed to truly appreciate the individual dishes and the holiday as a whole. Taylor's hope is that the 200 pages of Watermelon & Red Birds will center Black celebrations, Black creations and Black life, with food as the gateway to all that.\n\n\"In the United States, and more specifically in the American South, if you start looking at what people love the most, it is the Black hands that shaped our culture and traditions,\" she says. \"So the more we center American food -- and talk about enslaved people and free people, like our grandmas and our mamas, and how they moved in the kitchen and what they made -- the more people will appreciate Black Americans' contributions to the America that people love.\" In the end, she says, \"I've tried to give the reader, or the person cooking, more than just recipes and more than just Black food history. I've tried to give them a peek into contemporary and futuristic Black life.\"\n\nThe Essentials\n\nNicole Taylor riffs on the flavorful offerings you must bring to the picnic table this Juneteenth\n\nRED DRINK OR BUST:\n\n\"'What are we drinking?' I think that's the first thing I think about,\" Taylor says. She mentions portable options like her Sweet Potato Spritz, made with sweet potato syrup, sparkling wine and vodka. And something everyone can make easily is her Kool-Aid-inspired drink. \"It's dried fruits, pulverized down into a powder with sugar,\" she says, \"from which you can make a strawberry lemonade.\"\n\nA SPOIL-FREE SALAD:\n\n\"As much as I love potato salad, I'm always very concerned about it spoiling from being left out, particularly when it's hot,\" says Taylor. Instead, she recommends a tomato eggplant salad or one of her other easy-peasy alternatives. \"I would try to pick a salad that was a little bit more portable -- like the Summer Peas, Green Beans & Corn Salad. That's a perfect salad that won't spoil at room temperature. And if you have a cooler, it's just really easy to have in a container.\"\n\nGRILLED GOODNESS:\n\nWhile burgers are always welcome, roasted mushrooms are something different to bring to the gathering. However, Taylor says, you can really impress with lamb. \"If you're doing a picnic, the lamb chops can be thrown on the grill, and you can also grill the apricots and bring the chimichurri to go on the side,\" she says. \"If you just want to bring everything up a notch, I totally recommend you go with the lamb chops.\"", "source": {"uri": "essence.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Essence"},

We applaud the effort to bring more recognition to the diverse history of the United States, including events too long overlooked by our \"official\" history. However, it is important to remember that setting aside a holiday is no substitute for substantive action to reduce widespread racial disparities that continue to harm Black Americans.\n\nJuneteenth is a 157-year-old holiday, yet too few Americans have been familiar with the celebration that loosely marks the end of slavery in the United States.\n\nThe holiday gets its name from June 19, 1865, the day the Union army arrived in Galveston, Texas, to announce that all African-American slaves in the state were free in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, which was issued nearly three years earlier. Texas was the last state in the Confederacy to receive word that the Civil War was over and that slavery had been abolished.\n\nMaine House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross, the first Black woman to hold that office, sponsored the 2021 legislation that made Juneteenth an official state holiday. She discussed its significance in committee testimony at the time.\n\n\"The Juneteenth holiday does not celebrate one day in just one place, but instead it recognizes the harsh experiences of all those who were enslaved. The mothers, fathers, children and siblings who toiled in Maine's soil and built Maine's economy without enjoying their own freedom,\" Talbot Ross said, having highlighted Maine's often overlooked but nevertheless real historic role in slavery. \"These experiences are documented in our church records, in court cases and in the records of our own Maine State Archives. This is a part of history for all our communities and it is time that we recognize it completely.\"\n\nWe must overcome defensiveness to recognize and rectify difficult historical truths. We have a lot of work to do to successfully tackle the issues of today together.\n\nBlack Americans are less likely to have a college degree than white Americans, in part because of decades of legacy admissions that favor white applicants and policies that actively excluded people of color from American colleges.\n\nWhen Black Americans -- or any group of Americans -- are left out of our nation's progress, it is bad for all of us. So, this Juneteenth, participate in one of the many celebratory and informative events that will be held statewide. But also commit to working to end the racial injustices that have long been a part of America's history.", "source": {"uri": "bangordailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangor Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bdn_editorial_board@bangordailynews.com", "name": "Bdn Editorial Board", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maine Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Talbot_Ross", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Talbot Ross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/Organizations", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2024/06/Juneteenth-Maine.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 841, "textEnd": 848}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

The day itself is now widely viewed to celebrate the end of slavery across the country and not only in Texas.\n\nAt the time, in his order, Union Army Maj Gen Gordon Granger specifically announced that \"the people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free\".\n\n\"This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor,\" he continued.\n\nThe general's order continued: \"The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.\"\n\nJuneteenth was named after combining the June 19 date into one word and became recognized as a federal holiday back in 2021.

The dedicated Juneteenth shopper can find socks, golf balls, sunglasses, makeup bags, party favors and more.\n\nFor Baltimore community organizer and advocate Brian Sessions, that sort of merchandising is part of the \"controlling of the narrative\" of the holiday by corporations.\n\n\"You take the focus off of emancipation for Africans who were in America who were mistreated and misused and were diminished,\" Sessions said. \"America has a way of doing that for the sake of upholding American exceptionalism.\"\n\nJuneteenth commemorates June 19, 1864, when some of the last enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, received the news that slavery had been abolished more than two years earlier with the Jan. 1, 1862, signing of the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nBut even some of those enslaved people were not immediately freed -- some were held until after a harvest and others held longer. Kentucky and Delaware didn't end slavery until that December.\n\n\"That's what a lot of people don't know,\" said Justin \"Yaddiya\" Johnson, a go-go music advocate and organizer of a large Juneteenth celebration in Washington, D.C., formerly known as Moechella.\n\n\"When people start to do things from a capitalist lens it always takes away from the real essence because nobody is really celebrating it properly or is presenting it properly,\" Johnson said. \"They present however they can to sell their products. All of these holidays get used to boost the economy.\"\n\nThe holiday began as a simple local affair in south Texas to mark the anniversary of Juneteenth. It slowly spread to communities across the country. By the late 20th century, advocates were fighting to make it a national holiday. That goal was realized on June 17, 2021, when President Joe Biden signed the law making it the 11th, and newest, federal holiday.\n\nBut that mainstream success has soured for some.\n\nJohnson pointed to Pride celebrations and Christmas as similar situations where capitalism has separated holidays from their origins. Jared Ball, a professor of Africana studies and communications at Morgan State University, explained how Juneteenth's new mainstream presence was co-opted.\n\n\"Juneteenth is not an overt challenge to capital, or anti-Blackness, and white supremacy. It can be more or less easily manipulated,\" Ball said. \"It allows corporations to again manipulate a symbol, an image, an already unthreatening symbol and image ... and not feel that they're taking any risks.\"\n\nBall said the holiday's new presence allows corporations to take ownership of it.\n\n\"They can take credit for it. They can say, 'Ignore the fact that we're the same country that enslaved you, but that we can take credit for getting rid of it. Even as we've produced really nothing more beneficial for you,'\" he said.\n\nOne of the most high-profile examples of Juneteenth marketing that backfired came two years ago, when Walmart released a Juneteenth-themed swirled red-velvet and cheesecake ice cream which they pulled after social media backlash. In published reports at the time, the company said it pulled the ice cream off the shelves after getting \"feedback that a few items caused concern for some of our customers and we sincerely apologize.\"\n\nSessions said that Juneteenth messaging would be better if it was controlled by Black people.\n\n\"If you have us in totality controlling the narrative we are able to say, 'Yes, we appreciate emancipation but there's a lot of work that needs to be done,'\" Sessions said.", "source": {"uri": "marylandmatters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maryland Matters"}, "authors":

The latter freed over 3 million slaves, including the ones in Galveston, Texas that didn't know of their freedom. Let's walk through some of the facts of the latter's superiority over the former before grappling with the politics of our times.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln issued The Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. It never became a federal holiday despite the wishes of some organizations. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), presented a proposal in 2014 seeking to establish \"A National Holiday Commemorating Emancipation of the Slaves\" for the \"history and story\" to be \"properly researched and archived for the American People. It acknowledged the importance of the document for all Americans and sought for the holiday to be celebrated on January 1 of each year as a Jubilee. The NAACP resolution was presented during the Obama Administration. It was written before the word \"slaves\" was swapped for \"enslaved peoples.\"\n\nAs always, politics lurks behind every congressional action, no matter how noble the intent. I contend that Juneteeth got became a federal holiday while the Emancipation Proclamation didn't because Democrats in Congress were not about to draw attention to the fact that it was a president of the anti-slavery party -- the Republican Party -- that secured emancipation. To the Democrats, George Floyd's unfortunate death was the crisis that couldn't (and didn't) go to waste. His death created the perfect stormy atmosphere and pressure to take action. That would explain the irony that was the addition of Juneteenth as a proposed national holiday in President Donald J. Trump's 2020 \"The Platinum Plan\" for black Americans. Since Trump did not return to office, President Joe Biden seized the opportunity and choose Juneteenth rather than the NAACP's explicit preference to celebrate the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nJuneteenth's supposed bipartisan support was belied by the critical race theory language tucked into the resolution:\n\n\"NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 19, 2023, as Juneteenth Day of Observance. I call upon the people of the United States to acknowledge and condemn the history of slavery in our Nation and recognize how the impact of America's original sin remains. I call on every American to celebrate Juneteenth and recommit to working together to eradicate systemic racism and inequity (emphasis added) in our society wherever they find it. \"\n\nSystem racism and inequity is familiar language we associate with critical race theory and diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nIf we want to be true to history and have an educated populace, it will make a lot of sense for the national government to honor the significance of Lincoln's Proclamation even while lamenting the fact that hundreds of thousands of slaves were unaware of the proclamation. Juneteenth and the Emancipation of Proclamation should be rolled into one holiday celebration that should take place in January, the month we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King's birthday and we should celebrate the combined holiday by reading President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and discussing it with our children. This nationally unifying document reads in part:\n\n\"That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.\"\n\nBy contrast, the document inspiring Juneteeth, General Gordon Granger order (No. 3), only addresses the people of Texas:\n\n\"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor.\"\n\nWe can return to my initial question of how Juneteenth became the national holiday rather than the far more historically significant Emancipation of Proclamation. It is a testament to the politics of our nation. However it is redeemable, if the political will is there to combine the two and celebrate the national holiday as a teaching moment.\n\n- - -", "source": {"uri": "theminnesotasun.com", "dataType":

Heller, PhD, director of the IU South Bend Civil Rights Heritage Center, to better understand the flag color's significance and relationship to the national holiday.\n\nJuneteenth is holiday in which freedom is commemorated, as well as a day to remember the atrocities suffered by enslaved persons.\n\nIt's about \"acknowledging the impact of slavery and effort to bring the nation, itself, closer to living its founding ideals,\" explains Heller.\n\nWhile Juneteenth observes the day that the remaining enslaved people in Galveston were granted their freedom, in reality, Heller says that true freedom didn't occur until the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified in December of 1865, at which time slavery was outlawed and made illegal within the United States and any territories within its jurisdiction.\n\nAt its core, Juneteenth is emblematic of \"an effort to make it right,\" Heller says. \"By issuing General Order No. 3, General Gordon telling these people, 'You're free,' was one way of making it right.\"\n\nIn commemorating holidays like Veterans Day, Memorial Day and July 4, it's customary to display a flag in honor of the day and what it represents. The same holds true for Juneteenth.\n\nThere are two flags commonly associated with the observation.\n\nThe first is the Juneteenth flag. Designed by activist Ben Haith, the flag is red and blue with a white star in the middle.\n\nIn a 2022 interview with The Boston Globe, Haith said that he chose red, white and blue in recognition of enslaved Black people's connection to the nation's history.\n\n\"Our ancestors helped build this country, so our flag should have those colors, too,\" Haith told The Boston Globe.\n\nThe white star is intended to represent the lone star of Texas, the birthplace of Juneteenth. Surrounding the symbol is a secondary star that Haith said signifies a \"nova burst,\" or a new star.\n\n\"I thought, 'That might be something our ancestors can relate to,'\" Haith told The Boston Globe.\n\nFor Heller, however, Haith's flag isn't necessarily the one he embraces.\n\n\"The implication of using red, white and blue, the American flag colors, I think gives more of an impression that the nation has really made the transformations that I don't think it has made yet,\" he tells TODAY.com\n\nInstead, Heller and many members within the Black community prefer the symbolism of the Pan-African flag, which is black, green and red.\n\nThe origin of the flag can be traced to Nigeria, Ghana and other African nations that were fighting against colonialism in the 1960s. The flag was subsequently adopted by Black Americans as part of their own struggle for liberation in the U.S.\n\nAccording to Heller, the color red stands for the blood in which people \"have spilled in the fight for freedom and in the fight for liberation.\"\n\nGreen represents the land and black signifies the people.\n\n\"The red, black and green liberation colors seem to be much more in tune with the ongoing struggle that still needs to happen,\" he says.\n\nThough progress has come a long way since 1865, Heller says there's still work to be done.\n\n\"Race and particularly whiteness is still very much a consideration in many institutions and policies, even though it's implicit,\" explains Heller.\n\n\"That implicitness is still very real and very damaging, not just to Black people, but to minorities and those who have been historically marginalized. The journey for real equity is still an ongoing process.\"\n\nWhat can someone do to participate or learn more about Juneteenth?\n\nBeing informed is a good place to start.\n\n\"What we need to do is have moments of reflection and really acknowledge the history that Juneteenth represents,\" he says.\n\n\"For Juneteenth to be meaningful today is to understand that this has never been a colorblind society. We need to learn the nuances of our history and not just accept the broad-brush, triumphant narrative that we're normally taught.\"", "source": {"uri": "today.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Mich. (WLNS) - Juneteenth celebrations have rocked mid-Michigan with music beats and parade fun during the weekend. Much of the festivities continue this week in Eaton County as part of growing awareness of the anniversary of an important moment in American history.\n\nJazz music brought families together and got feet moving in Sharp Park in Delta Township Tuesday night. The park concert was part of a week of Juneteenth events happening around the holiday on June 19.\n\nDelta Township Trustee Fonda Brewer says the week of Juneteenth events are part of a now two-year collaboration with nearby communities in East Lansing, Meridian Township, Michigan State University, and Lansing.\n\n\"It's so important when we talk about our black history, everyone's history, and the independence of black people. And so that's why we're here. We're here to honor that and celebrate that beautiful holiday,\" said Brewer.\n\nWhile Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021, only 29 states and the District of Colombia observe the holiday as a permanent paid state and/or legal holiday. Michigan joined the ranks last year.\n\nThe holiday has been expanding since 1865 when on June 19, enslaved African Americans in Galveston Bay Texas were declared free by Union forces.

It's our responsibility to tell the story.", "body": "(Trent Nelson | The Salt Lake Tribune) The Juneteenth flag flies over City Hall in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, June 14, 2022.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday celebrates a crucial moment in the American struggle for freedom and justice. Celebrations of emancipation, like Juneteenth, are not just historical markers. They are living traditions that honor the long struggles, sacrifices, losses and triumphs of those who fought for freedom. They commemorate the ongoing journey to full freedom.\n\nDiscussion of history can be a complicated matter between communities and cultures. Many people would prefer to avoid it altogether. The Sema Hadithi African American Heritage and Culture Foundation tries to cultivate understanding and truth that gives room for growth and unity among diverse communities.\n\nBy uncovering and sharing the stories of Black Americans and the Native Nations who were also freed at the end of the Civil War, we protect the legacy of their struggles and contributions as we remember and honor them.\n\nEmancipation Day and Juneteenth\n\nThe way we celebrate freedom in the United States has changed over time. Emancipation Day, first celebrated on April 16, 1862, recognized 3,000 freed enslaved people in Washington, D.C. It is a milestone advocated by President Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass.\n\nWatch Night, or Freedom's Eve, on December 31, 1862, was a night of anticipation and prayer as African Americans awaited the enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation. This tradition exemplifies the collective hope of a people yearning for freedom. As news of the proclamation spread from Virginia to Mississippi, celebrations erupted, marking the realization of Lincoln's new birth of freedom.\n\nAs emancipation spread across the country, each state celebrated its unique journey in its own unique way. The patchwork of freedom reached Florida on May 20, 1865. In Galveston, Texas, it was June 19 when the Union General, Gordon Granger, delivered the order two-and-a-half years after the Emancipation Proclamation, recognized in Black communities as Juneteenth.\n\nDelayed freedom would become the course of the struggles and injustices the enslaved and free faced following the Civil War. Juneteenth has since become a symbol of African American persistent hope, a recognition of unrealized freedom and a celebration of familial and cultural legacy.\n\nThe fight for freedom continued long after December 1865 in the form of civil rights and true equality. The efforts of the Freedom Riders in the 1960s and the broader civil rights movement are emblematic of the ongoing fight against systemic racism, which presents itself as justice and equality for all Americans.\n\nEmancipation and Juneteenth in Utah\n\nEmancipation and Juneteenth are particularly poignant in the history of enslavement in Utah. While the state often associates freedom with the Mormon pioneers, it has a lesser spoken-about history of enslavement of members of Native Nations and African Americans.\n\nEarly Mormon settlers brought enslaved African Americans with them from places like Mississippi and Louisiana while also enslaving the people of the territory who had occupied the land for tens of thousands of years. Commemorating Juneteenth in Utah is a critical step toward acknowledging this history and fashioning a crucial understanding of the state's past.\n\nJuneteenth in Utah, as it is all over the nation, is a prescient reminder of the ongoing struggle for freedom, historic recognition, justice and a fair accounting of all its communities' narratives. Juneteenth should reflect the battle for growth, progress, genuine equality and unity.\n\nEmancipation celebrations underscore the importance of historical memory and cooperation in shaping a society where all its members belong. Emancipation honors our collective resilience, contributions, and desire for individual rights and dignity.\n\nIn Utah, historical societies of different communities are crucial in discovering, preserving and sharing Utah's history. Telling the stories of these communities fosters understanding and unity through historical truth. It is why the Sema Hadithi Foundation is working tirelessly with other community members and organizations to establish a free-standing Black History Museum that will permanently house the stories of Black Americans in Utah and the Mountain West.\n\nThe celebration of Emancipation Day and Juneteenth is a testament to the veracity of the human spirit, our hopes and our tireless pursuit of freedom. These commemorations remind us to always seek communion with our ancestors, who sacrificed and secured victories, as they call on us to continue to strive for a flourishing and loving society. We not only seek to fulfill their dreams for us, but we must also look forward to our progeny in the hope of creating a better place for their future free of hatred and oppression.\n\n(Photo courtesy of Robert S.

The day became a federally recognized holiday in 2021 following nationwide protests and social unrest after the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers in 2020.\n\nThree Black Miami professionals spoke to the Miami Herald about what Juneteenth means to them and the ways in which they are celebrating it.\n\nZakiyya White, founder of ZW Eventz\n\nThe middle of June means something special to North Miami event planner Zakiyya White. Celebrating Juneteenth means more than planning events for a single day -- she's planned a full week of programming that she hopes will stay with people long after June 19.\n\nWhite, 32, moved to Miami from Newark, New Jersey, in 2014 and created her Juneteenth events out of necessity, finding there were few in existence. She immersed herself in learning about the history of Black Miami communities like Overtown and Coconut Grove. As she learned more about Black Miami history, she wanted to find ways to attract people to Black-owned restaurants like Red Rooster and historical landmarks like the D.A. Dorsey House. Bringing people to Overtown, a historically segregated neighborhood, has become a personal mission for her.\n\n\"Overtown was the gathering spot and one of the only places Black people could congregate after certain hours,\" she said. \"It's important to acknowledge that we're now free to do what we couldn't do because of segregation laws.\"\n\nWhite said she was disappointed when she learned that boxing legend Muhammad Ali had fought in South Beach but was not allowed to stay there because of Jim Crow-era laws.\n\n\"People benefited off of Black culture and our talent, but we weren't celebrated for that, or only celebrated in certain parameters,\" White said. \"Now, we have to celebrate ourselves. Juneteenth is a reminder to celebrate ourselves and where we're going.\"\n\nAs White spends the week at Juneteenth events throughout Miami, she believes raising awareness about the holiday will allow more people of all backgrounds to celebrate the city's rich Black history.\n\n\"It's about promoting cultural growth,\" she said. \"It's there, and we have to shine a light on it.\"\n\nTeri Williams, CEO of OneUnited Bank\n\nTeri Williams, the CEO of the Black-owned OneUnited Bank, remembers being a girl in Indiantown, Florida, when she celebrated Juneteenth for the first time in the 1960s. Black people and white people were separated by train tracks in Indiantown at the time, but the Juneteenth celebrations were always joyful affairs for the town's Black residents.\n\n\"We used to have a barbecue on Juneteenth, and I don't think we could have imagined it being a national holiday,\" said Williams. \"It was sort of like a celebration within the Black community that only we knew about. To some degree, it sort of felt like it was ours.\"\n\nOneUnited has celebrated Juneteenth by providing financial literacy programming, something that has long been important to Williams. As a child, she developed an appreciation for Black business from her grandmother Annie Coachman, known by community members as \"Ma Honey.\" Coachman owned multiple businesses in Indiantown, including a penny candy store, a barbecue pit and several rental properties. Walking around with Ma Honey to collect rent from tenants taught Williams the importance of financial independence for the Black community.\n\nToday, Williams is hopeful that Juneteenth can serve as another reminder of the need for financial literacy and advocacy for businesses in the Black community.\n\n\"We are finally recognizing the importance of financial literacy and of Black businesses and how closing the racial wealth gap can be accomplished if we focus on those two things,\" she said. \"Making Juneteenth a federal holiday was really a tipping point for us as a country to say, yes, these things are important.\"\n\nShareef Nash, partner at PS Social\n\nAs a partner in the social media agency PS Social, Shareef Nash worked with the city of Miami Gardens to produce this past Saturday's Juneteenth Park-In & Party at Hard Rock Stadium. Like White, Nash also moved to Miami from Newark, New Jersey, and arrived in 2016 to join his business partner, Al Pierson.\n\nNash, 45, wanted to make sure Saturday's all-day event balanced education on Juneteenth's history and participation from Black-owned small businesses with entertainment, including a performance from R&B legend Stephanie Mills.\n\n\"We're highlighting community activists and kids,\" he said. \"It's not a day where we just come out and listen to music.\"\n\nNash said that he believes Gov. Ron DeSantis' efforts to diminish Black history in Florida schools make his work that much more important.\n\n\"DeSantis is doing things to remove our history from schools,\" he said. \"We have to make sure other folks understand the value we bring to the table. We should continue to educate, listen to our songs, tell our stories and share our recipes.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Specifically, it marks that day in 1865 when then-enslaved Black people in Texas were declared free by federal order, bringing enforcement of the Emancipation Proclamation to the last of the rebelling Civil War states.\n\nCelebrations of the day's anniversary have long been of special significance and commemoration for the Black community. But as they spread -- first in Texas and eventually across the county -- Juneteenth has become recognized for its importance to all Americans, marking as it does the end of one of the most pernicious stains on American history. It has come to be referred to as our second Independence Day, and, indeed, the federal holiday is officially named Juneteenth National Independence Day.\n\nRecognition in New Hampshire came late, however, with all but four states preceding the Granite State. There were some local observances, but it was not until 2019 that the Legislature acted, and five years ago today SB 174 took effect, requiring the governor each year to proclaim June 19 as Juneteenth and to call for \"appropriate ceremonies and activities commemorating the abolition of slavery.\"\n\nCertainly, the abolition of slavery is cause for celebration, even if its existence in this nation for a significant portion of its history, long after its founding, remains a tragic embarrassment for a country whose guiding principles are freedom and equality for all.\n\nBut commemorating Juneteenth requires more, for it marks not only the end of slavery but also the continuation of the essential effort to put behind us the racial discrimination and inequality that slavery was part of.\n\nThat demands of all a willingness to look inward and assess honestly our own individual commitment to acceptance and understanding of others and to acknowledge the prejudices each of us inevitably bears to some degree.\n\nIt also requires a willingness to learn and understand our troubled racial history, no matter how uncomfortable some may find it or think their children may find it. That knowledge is essential to addressing ongoing instances of racial intolerance and injustice and providing broader context for why addressing them matters so much.\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday born of the joyful celebration of the end of a horrible legacy of the country's past. But it must be as much about the present and future, giving us the opportunity to reexamine our own personal and collective commitment to color-, ethnicity- and religion- blindness and our resolve to achieving equality and acceptance for all.", "source": {"uri": "sentinelsource.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SentinelSource.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abolitionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abolitionism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "History of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racial discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/sentinelsource.com/content/tncms/custom/image/7819b5a8-f0c2-11ec-85c6-cff09f7b972a.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 23, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Elvi Gray Jackson, an Anchorage Democrat, was adopted by the Senate last year in a 16-4 vote. It passed the House last month in a 37-3 vote. The seven no votes came from Republicans.\n\nRepublican Gov. Mike Dunleavy has yet to sign it or comment on whether he intends to allow it to become law. Unless otherwise specified, bills go into effect 90 days after the governor signs them, meaning that even if the governor were to sign the bill early this week, state employees still would not receive a paid holiday on Wednesday.\n\nGray Jackson, who was slated to attend a Juneteenth celebration at the White House later this week, said Monday that even if state employees don't receive a paid holiday this year, she hoped Dunleavy would sign the bill ahead of this year's Juneteenth Day because of the symbolic significance of allowing the bill to become law.\n\nJuneteenth is already a federal holiday and a paid state holiday in a majority of U.S. states. As of last year, it is also a paid holiday for Anchorage municipal employees.\n\nThe bill was transmitted to Dunleavy on June 13, giving him several days to sign it before this year's June 19 holiday. But Rep. Stanley Wright, an Anchorage Republican who co-sponsored the bill, said Dunleavy would not be able to sign the measure because \"he is out of town.\" Dunleavy spokespeople did not respond to several questions about whether and when the governor planned to sign the bill, or the governor's whereabouts.\n\nDunleavy has until the end of the month to sign the measure, veto it, or allow it to become law without his signature.\n\nExisting state law instructs the governor to issue a proclamation marking Juneteenth Day on the third Saturday of June. Dunleavy's Saturday proclamation was not accompanied by any public statements or social media posts.\n\nThe origin of Juneteenth Day goes back to June 19, 1865, when Union troops arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, and freed more than 250,000 enslaved Black people.\n\nJuneteenth commemoration events in Anchorage included a celebration on the Park Strip on Sunday, and continued Monday with a luncheon that drew Attorney General Treg Taylor, U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, Mayor-Elect Suzanne LaFrance, and several state lawmakers, among others.\n\nCeleste Hodge Growden, president and CEO of the Alaska Black Caucus, said Monday that she hoped Dunleavy would sign the legislation. Because Juneteenth is already formally recognized as a federal and Anchorage city holiday, \"we just need to close the loop full circle, make this full circle by having the governor sign it,\" she said.\n\n\"It would just make such a world of difference,\" she said. \"It would show so much that the governor recognizes the importance of Juneteenth. This legislation, if he were to sign it, would go a long way, I think, in bettering our relationships.\"\n\nGray Jackson said Monday that after Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021, she got to work drafting a bill to make it a state holiday. The bill did not immediately gain traction, but after she reintroduced it in 2023, it received a positive response from lawmakers. She said she met with most House members earlier this year to advocate for the measure. The biggest concern she heard was about the bill's cost.\n\nAccording to fiscal notes produced this year, making Juneteenth a state holiday was expected to cost the state upward of $950,000 per year, mostly in overtime and holiday pay for essential service providers. More than half the cost would come from the Department of Corrections, which estimated the holiday would increase its budget by more than $534,000 per year.\n\nGray Jackson said she had a ready response for concerned lawmakers: \"You can't put a price on celebrating freedom.\"", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchorage,_Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anchorage, Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anchorage, Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galveston Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Peltola", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mary Peltola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treg_Taylor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treg Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Medical_Billing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Medical Billing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing_and_Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing and Regulations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Customer Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.adn.com/resizer//VXR68I8DAv-Wg2UVnDDBRcgUM-8=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/GOURHJKQO5G3NJ543BWCJUMT5A.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 85, "textEnd": 94, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 1343, "textEnd": 1350}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 2117, "textEnd": 2124}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Of those, about two-thirds understand what the holiday represents. Jarred Howard ('95) aims to improve this when the National Juneteenth Museum opens in 2026.\n\nHoward, the museum's CEO, said that while other institutions tend to view history more somberly, this one will celebrate everything Juneteenth stands for.\n\n\"We are literally celebrating freedom, which is the bedrock of our country,\" he said. \"The spirit, the energy, the engagement will all have a celebratory bent. It won't just be a museum; it will have many ways to celebrate the significance of Juneteenth and the freedom that Juneteenth brought for those formerly enslaved people in Texas.\"\n\nThe 50,000-square-foot space will sit on the corner of Rosedale Street and Evans Avenue in Fort Worth's Historic Southside neighborhood. For the last four decades, the location has been home to a smaller Juneteenth Museum, courtesy of Ms. Opal Lee ('63 M.Ed.). Known as the \"Grandmother of Juneteenth,\" Lee led efforts to have Juneteenth designated a national holiday, which finally happened in 2021.\n\nIt has been her life's mission to raise awareness of June 19, the date in 1865 on which enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom -- a full 2.5 years after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. Now 97 years old, Lee's vision has been realized in more ways than one. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2024 for her tireless advocacy. But her work still isn't finished.\n\nLee continues to have an immeasurable impact on those who know her, particularly Howard. He grew up in Fort Worth and has known Lee all his life. When Lee heard of Howard's vision to establish a National Juneteenth Museum, she offered the land on which her small museum sits. As the saying goes, \"On the shoulders of giants.\"\n\n\"You don't lead an effort like this without including Ms. Opal,\" Howard said. \"She really is at the core of everything that we're doing.\"\n\nA celebration of Juneteenth has been nearly a decade in the making. Howard began this journey with a much smaller footprint in mind. But given Juneteenth's growing popularity and awareness, those plans have been scaled significantly. When the museum opens, it will be an economic activity center with a food hall, business incubator, theater, community space, and other resources.\n\nThe neighborhood itself drove part of the expansion. The Historic Southside of Fort Worth lacks many social determinants of health and wealth. As a result, Howard said the area has the lowest life expectancy and the highest infant mortality rates in the country.\n\n\"When you consider those factors, you recognize the mandate is much bigger than just a museum where people come and look at exhibitions,\" he said. \"You know there are greater needs. And so, when you do a catalytic project like a National Juneteenth Museum, you want to leverage the opportunity to do much more than that.\"\n\nThe museum has multiple ties to UNT, in addition to Howard and Lee. Its Executive Strategist, Dr. Lauren Cross, is a former assistant professor at the College of Visual Arts and Design. Board member Deah Berry-Mitchell is a doctoral student in history and a Graduate Teaching Fellow.\n\n***\n\nHoward and his team are still gathering artifacts to exhibit. In July, they will host a History Harvest in partnership with UNT at the Fort Worth Ella Shamblee Library, where people can bring in items that can help tell the Juneteenth story.

The Juneteenth Scholarship Gala has been a staple in Galveston since 1992.\n\nUnlike the large marches, events and block parties seen today to honor the holiday, Boudreaux said that during the Jim Crow era, Black residents were wary about celebrating Juneteenth publicly and so pushed celebrations into private spaces, like churches and homes.\n\n\"I feel like getting that recognition for that holiday and uplifting these young girls in the community is something that's really important to us,\" said Jayden Moody, who was the second runner-up in the Miss Juneteenth Scholarship Gala.\n\nFor local Galveston teens, they say the gala is a chance to reclaim and uplift not just the region's history, but also their own connection to the past.\n\n\"It's a chance to embrace myself and my goals and remember what I'm here for, who my people were to get me here today,\" said Moody. \"Because of their hard work and their freedom, I get to be the passionate person I am.\"\n\nDorothy Brown, the gala's organizer, wanted to offer additional support to local girls and their families wanting to access higher education.\n\n\"I was trying to help our young ladies get a nice education and let them know that they have someone helping the parents,\" Brown said. \"I can remember when my children went to school ... it was hard, my husband and I worked hard to get our kids to school.\"\n\nBrown says Miss Juneteenth Scholarship Gala winners have gone on to become doctors, lawyers, and more. \"It opened the door for so many opportunities that I couldn't even imagine or comprehend at the time,\" said Madison Swain, who won in 2023 and became the Miss Juneteenth ambassador.\n\nBrown doesn't plan to end the volunteer-run scholarship program anytime soon, knowing the impact it has had on a community that she says feels like family.\n\n\"Well, I keep going because they're my daughters,\" said Brown. \"I keep going because I love the young women and I want them to reach their goals and don't stop, just go -

The Alabama house of representatives approved the bill, but it did not get a vote in the state senate.\n\n\"It is not a perfect bill, but it is one that will at least be put on the books that will declare Juneteenth as a state holiday,\" the bill's sponsor, state representative Juandalynn Givan, told the Washington Post. \"It's an acknowledgment that history happened, and I think we need to do whatever we can to make sure our history is not lost.\"\n\nSome Black lawmakers objected to Alabama's HB4 bill, pointing to how Davis was an enslaver who believed Black Americans were inferior to whites.\n\n\"The compromise it's asking me to make is just difficult,\" said state representative Chris England, who ultimately abstained from a vote. \"Black Americans often have to accept really big compromises to make really small progress.\"\n\nOthers warned that the compromise bill could be used to overturn measures adopted in some Alabama cities, like Tuscaloosa and Northport, to recognize Juneteenth as a state holiday.\n\n\"Not treating Juneteenth the way all other holidays are treated is a slap in the face to African Americans,\" Lisa Young, president of the Tuscaloosa county branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), told the Washington Post.\n\nSouth Carolina saw a similar bill that would have given state employees the choice of observing Juneteenth as a holiday instead of Confederate Memorial Day, but the state house did not hold a vote.\n\n\"With the attempt and the assault by the Republican party to eliminate the education of our history in public education, it is essential at this time in our history that we have every attempt to acknowledge the history of African and enslaved people,\" South Carolina state representative John King, a co-sponsor of the bill, said.\n\nEfforts to separate the joint state holiday celebrating Robert E Lee Day, a Confederate general, and the slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr also appear to have stalled in Alabama, as have efforts to abolish Confederate-related state holidays in other states.\n\n\"We're trying to separate the holidays of two men whose ideologies were totally separate, from one end of the totem pole to the other,\" Alabama state senator Vivian Davis Figures told Associated Press. \"One believed in justice and fairness for all, and another believed in slavery.\"\n\nThe continued recognition of holidays that honor the Confederacy \"speaks to the blatant disregard of the humanity of Black Alabamians\", Camille Bennett, the founder of the social justice non-profit Project Say Something, told the outlet.\n\nDaMareo Cooper, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, told Axios: \"There's no way that you can compare someone who literally fought for the highest ideals of human beings ... to someone who was like: 'I think these humans are checkbooks, they are cow, they're like animals.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leonie_chao_fong@theguardian.com", "name": "L\u00e9onie Chao-Fong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

It is thanks to her dedication that we were able to gather today and raise the flag. This is meant to be a day of joy, one where everyone should be allowed to come and share in our celebration.\n\nI would also like to thank and honor Ms. Opal Lee, who is known as the Grandmother of Juneteenth because of her courageous walk campaign to the White House in an effort to get the holiday federally recognized.\n\nIn addition, I honor and recognize the memory of the late Dr. Reverend Ronald Myers: Father of the Modern Day Juneteenth Movement and a graduate of our flagship university, UW-Madison. Although Dr. Reverend Myers passed away before the federal recognition of the Juneteenth holiday, his legacy lives on through this and every Juneteenth observance.\n\nIn this country that our ancestors built, together we are building a resilient community rooted in equity and in liberation.

The holiday also represents the beginning of the fulfillment of America's promise of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for Black Americans.\n\nPresident Abraham Lincoln issued The Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, declaring \"that all persons held as slaves\" within the rebellious states \"are, and henceforward shall be free.\" However, Texas resisted the Emancipation Proclamation for more than two years.\n\nOn June 19, 1865, U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, to enforce the Emancipation Proclamation and free the last enslaved Americans in Texas from bondage. This day became known as \"Juneteenth\", or \"Jubilee Day,\" \"Freedom Day,\" or \"Emancipation Day.\"\n\nJuneteenth is considered the longest-running Black American holiday. Over the years and through successive waves of migration, Juneteenth celebrations spread to the rest of Texas and eventually the country at large.\n\nThe Juneteenth Day of Observance officially became the 11th federal holiday in 2021 and is the first new federal holiday since the recognition of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday in 1983.\n\n\"Juneteenth represents not only the commemoration of the end of slavery in America more than 150 years ago, but the ongoing work to bring true equity and racial justice into American society,\" said U.S. President Joseph R. Biden before the signing of the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act on June 17, 2021.\n\nAPG Soldiers, civilians advocate for equality in Harford County\n\nJuneteenth is an integral part of Army life. It is a time to reflect on the crucial role the Army played in the Emancipation Proclamation and ending segregation in the U.S.\n\nOn July 26, 1948, President Harry Truman signed Executive Order 9981, which ended segregation in the military. This order marked a significant moment in the civil rights movement. It was also one of the first instances where a U.S. president used an executive order to implement a civil rights policy.\n\nLocally, APG Soldiers and civilians were instrumental in the desegregation of Harford County by leading efforts to desegregate local restaurants, facilitate school integration, and advocate for fair and open housing in the 1960s, said Patricia D. Cole, President of the Havre de Grace Colored School Museum and Cultural Center, Inc.\n\nThese efforts included peaceful protests, speeches, and involvement in lawsuits. For example, Cole said many Soldiers and civilians were involved in the Route 40 protests, advocating for the desegregation of restaurants and other public accommodations.\n\nIn the 1960s, George S.

Historically, Juneteenth has been no different. Yet something curious has happened since the day became a federal holiday in the United States in 2021. This jubilant celebration of African American independence has somehow become less fun.\n\nA controversy last June underscored this dynamic. A series of multiracial banners appeared throughout downtown Greenville, South Carolina, which raised angst among certain community members because of the Black origins of Juneteenth. What was lost in the conversation went beyond a sense of community - there was also a less celebratory mood.\n\nThat joy was restored for me, in part, by the Band of Brothers, an organization in Augusta, Georgia, that has hosted an annual Juneteenth event for several years. As I rode through downtown last June, past the James Brown statue, I was struck by the beautiful people filling the streets. It reminded me of perhaps Mr. Brown's most affirming opus - \"Say It Loud (I'm Black and I'm Proud).\"\n\nTravis \"Godbrotha\" Wright, a Band of Brothers member, understands the delicate balance between an occasion that promotes history and a good time.\n\n\"It's important for us to not just observe Juneteenth, but also to celebrate it in the same fashion as, say, the Fourth of July,\" Mr. Wright says in a phone interview. \"Some people feel it should be Afrocentric and educational, but the other part feels like you don't do that at a Fourth of July event.\"\n\nThe group doesn't eschew the educational component of the holiday. There's a perennial presentation from Wayne O'Bryant, a prominent historian, as well as African drum performances. After that? \"We want to party and have a good time with our kinfolk,\" Mr. Wright says.\n\nThe Brothers organized in 2017 with the intent of celebrating the holiday. The group was formed among civic-minded and entrepreneurial members, and has since grown into an organization that serves the community year-round.\n\n\"It may be a parent who's having an issue with their child, or a teacher who has an opportunity for speakers to come into their school,\" says Mr. Wright. \"Because we have 20 members with varying work schedules, there's always someone who can be pulled and show up for [the community].\"\n\nAccording to Mr. Wright, the annual event in Augusta is one of Georgia's largest Juneteenth celebrations, second only to one in Columbus. The Brothers have been able to secure well-known acts in the past, including the hip-hop group Goodie Mob. Festivities are as integral to the holiday as any effort to teach the history of Black liberation from chattel slavery. Indeed, some of the first Juneteenth celebrations went by another name, Jubilee Day.\n\nHonoring the celebratory nature of the holiday is something that should not be taken for granted. Rest and relaxation might not be revolutionary, but they are essential to peace and prosperity.\n\nBecause Juneteenth was largely resurrected on a nationwide basis during the Black Lives Matter movement, there will always be a select group of the populace that associates the holiday with that social justice uprising. That might be seen as a negative to some, but from my viewpoint, it acknowledges the hard-fought history of pro-Black legislation and the fight for liberation in this country.\n\nEven with that conflict in mind, there is still room to dance, and to dream.\n\nOne figure who has embodied that spirit is Opal Lee, a Texas teacher, humanitarian, and activist who is known as the \"Grandmother of Juneteenth.\" In May, President Joe Biden awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Her now iconic 1,400-mile walk in 2016 from Fort Worth, Texas, to Washington, D.C., helped secure federal recognition of Juneteenth. That journey was both purposeful and joyful, a fun endeavor that inspired an annual community Walk for Freedom.\n\nI hope these communal traditions endure, not just among grandmothers in Texas or brothers in Georgia, but for all who choose to celebrate Black freedom.", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Science Monitor"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The federal government began recognizing those traditions with an official holiday in 2021, and state lawmakers in New Hampshire pushed again this year for legislation to do the same.\n\nBut a majority of members in the New Hampshire House voted last month to defeat the proposal. Opponents of Senate Bill 481 said the June holiday could interfere with late-in-the-school-year events, and it could lead to state government offices being closed while many in the general public are working.\n\nA legislative committee concluded an annual proclamation marking Juneteenth as an observance, rather than a full-fledged holiday, would be \"the proper position for New Hampshire\" to take.\n\nJuneteenth marks the anniversary of June 19, 1865, the date on which emancipation from slavery was announced in Texas, more than two years after President Abraham Lincoln's proclamation. Texas was the first to recognize it as an official holiday, in 1980, and a majority of the states have followed suit in the past four years, according to information compiled by the Pew Research Center.\n\nMassachusetts, Maine, and Connecticut recognized Juneteenth as a state holiday in 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. Vermont and Rhode Island will join them this year now that their governors have signed legislation to that effect. That leaves New Hampshire as the only state in New England that doesn't recognize Juneteenth as a holiday.\n\nJuneteenth falls on Wednesday this year, but celebrations were also scheduled for last weekend, this weekend, and other times this month. For those looking to celebrate today, The Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire has advertised several events:\n\nIn Manchester, the Racial Unity Team and Currier Museum of Art are offering Juneteenth events for children and adults between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. at the museum, including conversations, doll making, storytelling and more.\n\nIn Hanover, the Dartmouth College Division of Institutional Diversity and Equity is hosting a community celebration from noon to 2 p.m.\n\nIf you cannot make it to an event, you could pay a visit to one of the historical markers the Black Heritage Trail has placed across New Hampshire, including in Andover, Derry, Dover, Exeter, Hancock, Jaffrey, Milford, Warner, and Windham, and at Nashua's Holman Stadium.\n\nThe Keene Family YMCA is also hosting a history walk concerning \"the ongoing freedom journey of Black Americans,\" with both a scenic trail at the YMCA and at participating merchants in the city's downtown area.", "source": {"uri":

I have to constantly weigh the risks and rewards of incorporating DEI into all levels of my organization -- and how to do it well. However, the risks businesses are facing around DEI implementation are worth noting. Ever since the Supreme Court essentially ended race-based affirmative action in higher education in 2023, more companies and organizations have walked away from DEI, citing that it's too \"risky.\"\n\nThe potential legal scrutiny that comes with DEI programming may be too much to bear. Companies in nearly all industries have had to alter their diversity policies to cover their legal bases. But at what cost? I would argue at the cost of fostering belonging, collaboration and the ability to create a workplace that celebrates diversity rather than hides from it.\n\nWe're quickly approaching one of the most important Black holidays in the U.S., the day the enslaved people in Texas learned that slavery had been abolished and that they were finally free on June 19, 1865. I'm talking about Juneteenth.\n\nMany companies have turned their backs on cultural holidays like Juneteenth out of fear of repercussions for celebrating or prioritizing diversity. Here's how they can reapproach them with the risks and rewards in mind.\n\nRelated: DEI Initiatives Are Dissolving -- Here's How Managers Can Step Up and Reverse This Unsettling Trend\n\nDiscovering one was finally free and no longer enslaved and then daring to take action on that discovery was both a revolutionary and scary thought back in 1865. Enslaved people at the time had only dreamed of the taste of freedom after hearing how fellow enslaved people in the South had migrated North to explore freedom in another part of the country.\n\nLiving as a full citizen in the United States at a time when dehumanization was all too common was a reward finally in reach. It was risky to exercise your freedom a s a newly freed person. Clearly, the risks were worth the rewards. Envisioning and working toward the rewards that come from celebrating diversity and engaging in DEI efforts despite the risks is what I would encourage companies to explore as well.\n\nCompanies can tie the holiday of Juneteenth to other scenarios and historic events when freedom was granted where it wasn't before. Most American workers can relate to the ideal of freedom. Make the case that Juneteenth isn't just a Black holiday but a story of freedom, liberation and the beginning of a certain group's ability to exercise free will. Tying Juneteenth to larger themes not only covers the \"risk\" bucket -- where you're not only celebrating one group of people and their history -- but it also invites others to emotionally connect with the universal value of individual freedom. This reframing invites inclusion and compassion into a holiday that would otherwise be seen as a \"risk\" to celebrate.\n\nNot everyone knows a ton about Juneteenth. They may have first heard of it in 2021 when President Biden declared Juneteenth a national holiday. Those who weren't aware of the history may have seen Juneteenth as an additional day off, like the 4th of July. But it's more than that. Make Juneteenth a learning opportunity for all. Without necessarily treating Black workers differently, HR, executives, managers and leaders can share the historical facts about Juneteenth so all workers can understand why it's a national holiday worth celebrating. There is no risk in sharing historical facts, so employees are more informed about the holiday's historical significance. The reward is a more informed and understanding workforce that can be grateful for how freedom for some means freedom for all and how that's part of the fabric of American life -- both inside and outside the workplace.\n\nRelated: How Inclusive Leaders Can Understand and Harness the Power in Juneteenth\n\nWhen people know better, they can do better. The hostile environment that has recently subverted DEI does nothing to build compassion, inclusion, or collaboration among workers and within the company. So, why not introduce Juneteenth education as a tool for appreciation? When people understand the challenges faced by those seeking freedom, they can look at their fellow Black coworkers not as victims of a cruel system of slavery but as descendants of those who rose up and fought for their freedom with resilience. Avoiding Juneteenth and all mention of it robs employees, Black or not, from garnering an appreciation for the moment we're living in and from feeling grateful for the diverse workplace they enjoy. Before the 1950s, an integrated workforce was a pipe dream. Now, celebrating Juneteenth can be a day that highlights the power of resilience, integration, and freedom for all.\n\nThere are risks and rewards with every aspect of business. However, the risk of neglecting to celebrate diversity, leaving differences and commonalities between workers as a secret not worth mentioning, or ignoring the historical significance of certain events in the states isn't worth it. The reward of encouraging cultural awareness through discussing historical events that have cultural implications can create a more appreciative, collaborative, and empowering workplace -- not diminish or harm it. Recommitting to DEI can be rewarding. The key is to find the middle ground between risk and reward and recommit to celebrating diversity.", "source": {"uri": "entrepreneur.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entrepreneur"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nika_white@entrepreneur.com", "name": "Nika White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirmative_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Affirmative action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Individualism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free will"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace_Discrimination", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workplace Discrimination", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/2000/1718200927-change-approach-to-juneteenth-business-0624-g1482144236.jpg?format=pjeg&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 3152, "textEnd": 3163}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 1045, "textEnd": 1052}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

It's also a celebration of diversity; it emphasizes the diversity within the community and honors the historical and cultural significance of Juneteenth.\"\n\nTaylor-Diallo is a Trinbagonian-born physician and artist whose Caribbean roots deeply influence her work. She also draws inspiration from the rhythmic beats of calypso, soca, and steelpan, music, and the resilience of her ancestors.\n\nHer hope is to convey visual expressions that also act as \"catalysts for dialogue and understanding, challenging viewers to confront complex issues and celebrate the richness of Caribbean culture,\" according to an artist bio she shared with the Reformer.\n\n\"Art has the power to educate and provoke thought,\" she said. \"BIPOC art often addresses themes of identity, history, social justice, and cultural heritage, providing an opportunity for a rural white community to engage with different perspectives and histories they might not otherwise encounter. It encourages conversations about race, equality, and shared history, and hopefully promoting empathy and unity across diverse backgrounds.\"\n\nTaylor-Diallo said the opportunity from the town empowers Black artists to share their stories and experiences.\n\n\"It validates our voices and talents, encouraging further artistic expression and fostering a supportive environment within the community,\" she said. \"It challenges existing norms and expands the definition of what art is valued and appreciated and how art is curated and supported within the community. It certainly encourages me and gives me the confidence to showcase my history and learned life experiences through art.\"\n\nJessica Sticklor, town administrative assistant, said the IDEA Committee made up of town staff would love do a bigger event next year. IDEA stands for Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access.\n\nOnce Juneteenth is over, the committee plans to start applying for grants to get more funding for an event next year.\n\n\"That was a major concern this year,\" Sticklor said. \"We really wanted to make sure that if we do a larger event that leans more heavily on the larger community next year, we'd be able to compensate them fairly.\"\n\nSticklor said the town started planning for a bigger event by collaborating with Djeli of Brattleboro \"but it became clear that we should hold off to work on the event for next year, hopefully with more funding.\"\n\n\"Perhaps next year we'll work together,\" she said.\n\nVermontitude Episode 69: Celebration of Juneteenth, with guest Djeli\n\nIn this week's Vermontitude video webcast, host Peter \"Fish\" Case chats with Juneteenth orga...\n\nDjeli, formerly Bill Forchion, is looking to organize a local celebration and recognition of the holiday that commemorates the emancipation of enslaved people in the U.S. He can be emailed at djelisdream@gmail.com.\n\nHis hope is to start something next year that continues as a local tradition.\n\n\"I have support from some close friends, and I had hoped that this year would be the year,\" he said in a recent episode of \"Vermontitude\" hosted by Peter \"Fish\" Case. \"I've sat on this for many years, trying to figure out how to be the uniter of a community, to come together around this topic and I realized I can't do it alone.\"\n\nDjeli said he would \"love to start with just coming together and nourishing each other.\"\n\n\"That nourishment could be our company,\" he said. \"It could be food.

Some of the soldiers who are receiving corrective recognition on this plaque today were among the soldiers who brought that news to Texas.\"\n\nThe Select Board had approved the new plaque and funding for the project, which involved several local organizations.

We will not survive as a nation if we are divided.\n\nRepublicans should embrace and celebrate Juneteenth. It's a holiday that celebrates the first great achievements of the Republican Party: preserving the Union and liberating the slaves. It is time to recognize the emancipation of former slaves as a day of universal rejoicing and soberness as we contemplate the terrible price our nation has paid for the original sin of slavery. Juneteenth, celebrated on the 19th of June, is a perfect opportunity for that recognition.\n\nEmbrace Juneteenth As a National Holiday\n\nJuneteenth has been an unofficial holiday in the African-American community for over 150 years. It commemorates the June 1865 official notification in Texas that the slaves had been freed two years earlier. Although celebrated initially only in Texas in 1866, the holiday spread to the rest of Black America over the following years. It was not widely recognized by the rest of America, however, until 2020, when Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced a bill to create the new holiday. It is fitting that a Texas Republican introduced the legislation. It was fitting that a Republican president, Donald Trump, first made Juneteenth a holiday by executive order before the bill became law.\n\nDemocrats Trying To Cover Up Their Racist Past\n\nFor decades, Democrats have tried to cover up their racist past and blame racial tension on Republicans and their policies. While Sen. Cornyn was drafting his bill, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was busy removing portraits and statues of slave holders and segregationists from the Capitol. Pelosi failed to mention that, except for one Independent, all those segregationists and slave holders were Democrats.\n\nPelosi said nothing about the statues in Baltimore honoring Confederate leaders. Her silence may be attributable to the fact that the statues were erected while her father, Tommy Alessandro, was mayor-for-life of Baltimore. There is a clear pattern here, and I suspect that the removals have more to do with Democrats' desperate attempt to erase their racist history than with caring for Black lives.\n\nWoke rioters repeated \"Black Lives Matter\" robotically while ignoring the thousands of Black lives taken by criminal violence (and the thousands more saved from criminal violence by heroic police officers). They still ignore the millions of Black lives sacrificed on the altar of eugenic population control by Democrats in thrall to the death cult of abortion. How many of the woke ones know that hundreds of thousands of white men -- soldiers in the Union Army -- died to give liberty to the Black men, women, and children who were enslaved? How many know that the system of slavery was protected for centuries by cagey politicians, all of whom were Democrats?\n\nRepublicans who fail to embrace Juneteenth allow the perpetuation of Democrat lies and attempts to erase their history. It is a holiday celebrating Republican achievements, and we should be rightly proud of it.\n\n\"The Black National Anthem\"\n\nCelebrating Juneteenth will ensure that the history of the Emancipation Proclamation and the honorable fight to free the slaves and preserve the Union will not be forgotten. I was in my twenties before I heard of Juneteenth, and in my thirties before I first heard \"Lift Every Voice And Sing,\" the great hymn that is sometimes called \"the Black National Anthem.\" Every school child should be taught both the holiday and the hymn, so they learn the history associated with them.\n\nThe entire nation would be edified by learning these verses. My favorite is the last:\n\nGod of our weary years,\n\nGod of our silent tears,\n\nThou who has brought us thus far on the way;\n\nThou who has by Thy might\n\nLed us into the light,\n\nKeep us forever in the path, we pray.\n\nLest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,\n\nLest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;\n\nShadowed beneath Thy hand,\n\nMay we forever stand,\n\nTrue to our God,\n\nTrue to our native land.\n\nThe riots and arson that we saw in the year following the murder of George Floyd will not improve Black lives. They have brought only misery to the communities where they took place. But the pain of the Black community is undeniable. It deserves to be addressed. Symbolic acts are a good starting point for understanding one another. Celebrating Juneteenth together as a national holiday will unite us all in beginning that understanding. We will not survive as a nation if we are divided.\n\nAs President Lincoln said in his first Inaugural Address, \"We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\"", "source": {"uri": "amgreatness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Greatness"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Today, it's now a federal holiday, with President Joe Biden making the legislation official on June 17, 2021.\n\nWith the nation examining its history of racial inequality, appeals to recognize the significance of Juneteenth more fully had been growing since summer 2020. In the lead-up to 2021 celebrations, a number of companies -- including Nike, the National Football League, Twitter and more -- announced that the day would be a company holiday.

Find out here", "body": "By Nollyanne Delacruz | ndelacruz@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group\n\nAs Juneteenth celebrations sweep the Bay Area, the actual holiday may be a little quieter as several public services will be closed for the day.\n\nJuneteenth, celebrated on June 19, commemorates the end of slavery in 1865, two years after the Emancipation Proclamation. In 2021, the date officially became a federal holiday. Because of that, many government services are closed.\n\nThe United States Postal Service confirmed that all post offices will be closed on Wednesday. However, UPS and FedEx stated that their offices will be open and pickup and delivery services will be available.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, New York Stock Exchange and most bank branches will also be closed for Juneteenth, including Capital One, Bank of America, PNC, Truist, Citibank, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase.\n\nSocial Security and DMV offices will also be closed in California on Wednesday.\n\nAcross the Bay Area, county offices, courts and most departments are expected to be closed. Many cities, including San Jose, Redwood City and Fremont, also announced that their city halls will be closed for the holiday. However, Santa Clara's city hall will be open on Wednesday.\n\nUnfortunately for many California state employees, Juneteenth is not a paid holiday. CalMatters reported last year that workers have to request Juneteenth off as one of their four personal holidays. But some offices, like the State Treasurer's Office, will be closed for for the holiday.\n\nMost public transportation lines will also be open for service. Both BART and Caltrain are operating regular weekday service hours. The River Oaks Lobby of the Valley Transportation Authority will be closed Wednesday, but their Downtown Center office will be open and operating at regular hours. VTA buses and light rail cars are also expected to operate on a regular schedule.\n\nIn the East Bay, AC Transit will follow a Sunday schedule on Juneteenth, the agency said.\n\nLastly, most privately-owned grocery stores, retail stores and restaurants will be open on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "mercurynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Jose Mercury News"}, "authors":

Juneteenth South Broward founder Georgette Lasley said she developed the celebration after discovering a need in her community. At the time she owned a small cafe in Liberia. She explained that one year, as she greeted customers on Juneteenth she was surprised by their reaction.\n\n\"Everyone walked in on the 19th and I was like 'Happy Juneteenth!' Everyone was looking at me like a girl, what are you talking about? Nobody knew at that time what Juneteenth was. I'm like, you guys don't know what Juneteenth is? We're predominantly in an African American community, and you guys don't know what Juneteenth is? That's what gave me the go ahead, or the go to say you know what I'm going to start an organization,\" said Lasley.\n\nBringing her vision to reality faced obstacles. She said she was initially turned down by several municipalities.\n\n\"So, knowing that I lived this firsthand is something. So that's why the celebration of freedom, the celebration of me being who I am means a lot to me. Juneteenth's celebration of our freedom is something that everyone should get involved with. It doesn't matter what color you are. You know, our freedom matters, everyone's freedom matters,\" said Lasley.\n\nShe began attending City of Hollywood meetings and made her case for the event. Hollywood city leaders said yes.\n\n\"They were the only ones that opened the door for me to do it,\" said Lasley.\n\nThat's how the Juneteenth South Broward Parade was born.\n\n\"Each year, Georgette, you persist, you push that pebble, until it's a stone, and then it becomes a rock, and then it becomes a boulder, until it becomes a mountain of support for making sure we can fight back against discriminatory conduct, laws, and oppression which is what we've been able to do on this national holiday once and for all,\" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz at last year's celebration.\n\n\"We started out with one to two hundred people throughout the first five years to my seventh year when it grew, and it was so phenomenal. I was so surprised by all the people on the side of the road, they were literally waiting on us with lawn chairs, and I mean families coming out of their homes and it was amazing to me. I'm just so, thankful, very thankful,\" said Lasley.\n\nNow, eight years later, hundreds line the streets of Hollywood for the annual celebration of freedom and the end of slavery in the United States.\n\nThe parade kicks off at 10 a.m. at 5199 Pembroke Road. It then heads west N 56th Avenue.

However, on Wednesday, most are in observance of the national holiday.\n\nJuneteenth is a holiday of celebration, liberation and education. It marks the end of bondage for Black people while echoing the work that still needs to be done to achieve true freedom and equality.\n\nJuneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, when enslaved Black people in Galveston, Texas, were notified of their freedom. The news of this freedom came late, specifically two years after the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, which declared enslaved people in Texas free. The Civil War, which ended in the spring of 1865, also solidified this freedom. Later that year, in December 1865, slavery officially was abolished with the 13th Amendment.\n\nHere are a few things to check out Wednesday:\n\n1. Boom Concepts will present a Black Power Story Time in the Slavery to Freedom Garden at the Frick Environmental Center. The event, geared toward children ages 4 to 9, will take place from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. Children will hear from award-winning artist DS Kinsel and co-founder of Boom Concepts as he reads two children's stories. After the reading, attendees are invited to participate in a garden activity with Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy naturalists and educators. Learn more here.\n\n2. A family community picnic will take place from 1 to 6 p.m. at West Park across from the Gus & Yiayia's. Everyone is welcome to pack a basket or bring a grill and any water sports of games for children to enjoy. Music will be provided. Learn more about the event here.\n\n3. McKeesport will host its third annual Juneteenth festival from noon to 6 p.m. on Bailee Avenue and Flagler Street. The event promises day of fun, community fellowship and free food. There will be a DJ, vendors and giveaways. Learn more here.\n\n4. The Greensburg-Jeannette NAACP will present a Juneteenth Black Owned Business Fair from 3 to 7 p.m. at The Historic Fairview Park. The event will include live music, food and other vendors throughout the day and is free.\n\n5. At Woodville museum in the Bridgeville area from 6 to 7:30 p.m., guests can celebrate Juneteenth with historian Rob Windhorst and the presentation \"The Enslaved Community at Bower Hill and Woodville: 1775-1803.\" The conversation will discuss the latest research on the largest African American community west of the Allegheny Mountains prior to 1810. The event is free, and registration is encouraged.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shaylah_brown@triblive.com", "name": "Shaylah Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serfdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Clay_Frick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Henry Clay Frick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NAACP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagler_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flagler Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegheny_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allegheny Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scholarship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Historian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picnic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Picnic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKeesport,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McKeesport, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McKeesport, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodville,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Woodville, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Woodville, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2024/06/7456001_web1_AP23168782314515.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 132, "textEnd": 139}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 438, "textEnd": 445}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

This date would become known as \"Juneteenth,\" a celebratory event of Black jubilation and an exuberant marker for history that continued to evolve and nurture its own traditions and continued conversations about what it means to be free.\n\nSamuel Collins III is a historian, preservationist and president of The Juneteenth Legacy Project (J19LP) -- a Galveston, Texas-based nonprofit that aims \"to recontextualize Juneteenth as a pivotal moment in the arc of U.S. history.\"\n\nThe seventh-generation Texan has devoted a significant portion of his adult life to educating the public about Juneteenth and advocating for the day to be recognized as a national holiday.\n\n\"[It's] important to keep educating the public at the center of the celebrations because we must always remember why we are celebrating the holiday,\" Collins remarked in an email to HuffPost.\n\nOn June 17, 2021, the relentless work of many African American preservationists, social advocates and others was finally realized, when President Joe Biden signed a bill making Juneteenth a federal holiday.\n\nAmid this success, it's imperative to observe the holiday, and all that it represents, in a way that strays from an overly white-centered lens and into the Black perspective.

It took more than two years for enslaved people in Texas to learn that the Civil War was over and that the Emancipation Proclamation had been signed.\n\nBut this holiday should not focus only on Union soldiers arriving in Galveston, Texas, and liberating the last of the 10 million Black people who had been enslaved. Rather, it should serve as an opportunity for all Americans to pause and learn about the years leading up to emancipation, and the decades afterward. It should make us ask how, as a nation, did we get here?\n\nThe journey began with 240 years of torture and an estimated 410 billion hours of forced labor as Black people's blood, sweat and tears built our nation's economic foundation and enriched hundreds of families and institutions.\n\nWhile Juneteenth marked the day when all Black people were to be \"free,\" it also ushered in short-lived protection of the formerly enslaved by the Freedmen's Bureau during Reconstruction. Then followed decades of lynchings and Black Codes, followed by Jim Crow laws, followed by the Supreme Court's ruling in Brown v. the Board of Education, and the re-segregation of public schools. Those actions were followed by the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Almost 50 years later we witnessed the dismantling of the Voting Rights Act with Shelby County v. Holder and with extreme gerrymandering in some states and other actions of voter suppression.\n\nThen came the creation of affirmative action and the dismantling of affirmative action by the Supreme Court, and the creation of Diversity Equity and Inclusion initiatives and now efforts to dismantle them.\n\nAll of these actions can be traced to the issue of race, and thus slavery. Attempts toward progress are often met with backlash.\n\nThree champions of freedom warned us of such, yet gave us a road map to overcome any obstacle.\n\nFrederick Douglass, the 19th century orator and abolitionist, said, \"Power concedes nothing without a demand.\"\n\nThe late U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan, who in 1967 was the first African American elected to the Texas state Senate since Reconstruction, said: \"What the people want is very simple -- they want an America as good as its promise.\"\n\nThe latest backlash comes in the form of attacks on teaching America's history. Juneteenth should remind us of that as well. As Martin Luther King Jr. said, \"If the cruelties of slavery could not stop us, the opposition we now face will surely fail.\"\n\nJuneteenth is more than a symbolic gesture by Congress that even those who constantly oppose civil rights voted to approve.\n\nOn this day, as we acknowledge Juneteenth and its significance to Black Americans, may all people and generations learn of the struggle, remember the fight and work toward the possibilities of true freedom.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voting Rights Act of 1965"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galveston, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reconstruction era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Codes_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Codes (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedmen's_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedmen's Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gerrymandering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_County_v._Holder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shelby County v.

Although many are new to the holiday, Juneteenth gatherings have been taking place around the country for decades.\n\nI was raised in a house with a father who was a Garveyite, pan-African activist. That meant not only learning about Black history and current news, but also prioritizing Black American holidays as often as possible. Typical Juneteenth celebrations have included music, conversation and a dish that is red, black and green, such as a pasta salad or more commonly watermelon.\n\nAlthough Juneteenth is celebrated by many African Americans, there's an uneasy discomfort some feel about the holiday. One common argument is that we're not actually free, that slavery still exists in different forms today. Another is that we shouldn't celebrate the day slavery was outlawed because it should have never been legal in the first place. Some will argue that having your humanity finally recognized is not something that we should laud. In fact, they find it to be quite degrading it took so long.\n\nWhen I first produced the New Orleans Juneteenth Festival in 2020, I heard all these talking points. Many elders who fought through Jim Crow and other injustices didn't see the vision. Another point I would hear often was, \"What does this have to do with New Orleans? Juneteenth is for Texas.\"\n\nJune 19 has its own significance in the beautiful city of New Orleans. In the 1700s, Juan San Mal\u00f3, a formerly enslaved man, helped a group of enslaved people escape and create settlements in the wilderness of the bayous. These people were called Maroons. The Juan San Mal\u00f3 uprising led to him being executed on June 19, 1794. We now recognize that day as Juan Mal\u00f3 Day.\n\nJuan Mal\u00f3's revolutionary act of rebellion aligns with the spirit of New Orleans. New Orleans is a rebel city. And Louisiana is the place where people such as Benito Ju\u00e1rez, the Acadians and others who dared to rebel were exiled to.\n\nNew Orleans was an unconventional Southern city where the rules were bent. During French rule, enslaved people were allowed a day off due to the beliefs of Catholicism. On that day, enslaved Africans would meet and dance in what we now call Congo Square. When France transferred ownership to Spain in 1763, the Spanish enacted a policy called coartaci\u00f3n that allowed the enslaved to purchase their freedom. Congo Square became a marketplace for Africans to sell their talents, fabrics and food. Congo Square is now home to the New Orleans Juneteenth Festival where you can witness the music, drums and an extensive marketplace of entrepreneurs and local businesses.\n\nSo should Juneteenth be a celebration or a commemoration?\n\nI say it's both. It's the day we commemorate the awareness of the outlawing of chattel slavery in the United States. It's also the day we celebrate freedom fighters and rebels who didn't wait for the colonies to recognize their humanity.\n\nThe question of whether we're truly free or not will always be an ongoing debate among the race of people we now call African American. It seems almost every generation our political label changes, but the amount of political restitution and equity remains stagnant. So I empathize with the frustrations of people who refuse to celebrate mere symbols of freedom.\n\nI submit that freedom is not something you can ask for, vote for or negotiate on. It's something you demand or create, and it's how you choose to maneuver throughout this planet with the tools accessible to you. It is up to us to decide how we want to be represented, defined and obtain the fair and prosperous life all humans have a divine right to.\n\nIn the words of my late father, \"So whatcha gonna do?\"",

That day, which would become known as Juneteenth, the Army arrived to enforce what had already been the law of the land for two and a half years -- the Emancipation Proclamation. Today, we recognize that Juneteenth not only marks the end of America's original sin of slavery but also the beginning of the work at the heart and soul of our Nation: making the promise of America real for every American.\n\nOne of my proudest moments as President was signing into law Juneteenth as a new Federal holiday -- the first Federal holiday to be established since Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day four decades prior. Juneteenth is an acknowledgment of the truth of our Nation's history. It is about realizing the idea that America was founded on: All people are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives. It is about the generations of brave Black leaders and selfless activists who never let us walk away from that idea, including Ms. Opal Lee, whom I awarded the Medal of Freedom for her work as the grandmother of Juneteenth, and former State Representative Al Edwards, who authored the bill to designate it a holiday in Texas.\n\nMy Administration is working to ensure we continue to deliver on that idea -- creating a country that truly stands for freedom, justice, dignity, and opportunity for all. Today, record numbers of Black Americans have jobs and health insurance, and Black business ownership is growing at the fastest pace in over 30 years. We are investing more money than ever in Black families and communities. That includes the funding we are delivering to support predominantly Black neighborhoods that had been divided and left behind by segregation and racial discrimination, the checks we delivered that reduced Black child poverty to the lowest rate in history, the changes we have made to the appraisals process to root out biases that put Black homeowners at a disadvantage, and the over $16 billion investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities so that we can ensure the next generation of Black leaders has equal opportunities for a quality education and pathways for economic mobility. We are working to rebuild and strengthen all of America by removing every lead pipe across our country, delivering affordable high-speed internet, forgiving $167 billion in student loan debt, and creating good-paying jobs that you can raise a family on. We are creating a new sense of pride and dignity in communities across the country.\n\nAs we work to make history, my Administration is also working to tell our Nation's history instead of erasing it. That is why I signed a law, which had been more than 100 years in the making, to designate lynching as a Federal hate crime. I designated the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument to preserve historic sites and cultural resources in Mississippi and Illinois so that we never forget the brutal lynching of Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 and the subsequent courage of his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, who made sure our Nation would never forget her son. I have honored some of our country's greatest Black scholars, humanitarians, and artists, who dare to tell the good, bad, and truth of our Nation. We are writing new chapters of our history, and I am proud to have the most diverse Administration ever to tap into the full talents of our Nation -- including the first Black woman Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris -- and to have appointed the first Black woman as a Justice on the United States Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson. Meanwhile, we are also working to secure the right to vote -- with which anything is possible.\n\nOn Juneteenth, may we celebrate the essence of freedom that galvanized the country, the progress we have made in our Nation, and all that is possible when we march forward together. May we all recommit to redeeming the very soul of America -- choosing love over hate, unity over division, and progress over retreat.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 19, 2024, as Juneteenth Day of Observance. I call upon the people of the United States to acknowledge and condemn the history of slavery in our Nation and recognize how the impact of America's original sin remains. I call on every American to celebrate Juneteenth and recommit to working together to eradicate systemic racism and inequity in our society wherever they find it.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.", "source": {"uri":

And that's important to them and we make sure to let them know how great they are.\"\n\nJuneteenth, short for \"June Nineteenth,\" marks June 19, 1865 as the day Major General Gordon Granger led Union soldiers to Galveston, Texas to announce the end of the Civil War and proclaim freedom for enslaved people.\n\nThis announcement came over two years after President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation had officially outlawed slavery in the Southern states.\n\nOn June 17, 2021, President Joe Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, officially making June 19 a federal holiday.\n\n\"I'm glad that they passed a bill because it really means a lot,\" Building manager for the Town of Hempstead Bishop Willie Fowler said. \"Education is very important not just for us, but for others who don't even look like us to get an understanding of who we are.\"\n\nThe event also gave the stage to young community members, who educated the audience on the genesis of Juneteenth, its historical significance and the sacrifices that were made to secure the emancipation of Black people.\n\n\"This experience really expanded our horizons and we had the privilege to minister to the audience and show the emotion of what it feels like to be free and liberated from the shackles that our people have been through,\" God's Property dancer Ashley McClymont, 17, of Springfield, Queens.\n\nMost Suffolk County employees have the federal holiday off, spokesman Mike Martino told Newsday, while Nassau County does not allow employees to take it -- drawing the condemnation of the New York State Black, Puerto Rican, Hispanic, and Asian Legislative Caucus.\n\nAssemb. Michaelle Solages (D-Elmont), a caucus chairwoman, said in a statement Tuesday: \"Nassau County represents several unique cultures and ethnicities, some of which are being disregarded by this upsetting decision. Although the County held a recent Juneteenth celebration, the Nassau County Government refuses to recognize Juneteenth as a paid County holiday, unlike the federal and state governments.\"\n\nHer statement continued: \"Ignoring the actual significance of this anniversary is a disservice to those who were liberated as well as their descendants.\"\n\nIn February 2022, Nassau Legis. Siela Bynoe (D-Westbury) filed a bill requiring the county to recognize Juneteenth as a county holiday. Majority Republicans in the Nassau County Legislature never called the bill for a vote.\n\nCounty officials have said Nassau cannot recognize the holiday until it's been negotiated into union contracts. Representatives for Blakeman and Majority Republicans in the County Legislature did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Read the entire presidential proclamation below. A Proclamation on Juneteenth Day of Observance,2024\n\nOn June 19, 1865, freedom finally came for the 250,000 enslaved people of Texas. That day, which would become known as Juneteenth, the Army arrived to enforce what had already been the law of the land for two and a half years -- the Emancipation Proclamation. Today, we recognize that Juneteenth not only marks the end of America's original sin of slavery but also the beginning of the work at the heart and soul of our Nation: making the promise of America real for every American.\n\nOne of my proudest moments as President was signing into law Juneteenth as a new Federal holiday -- the first Federal holiday to be established since Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day four decades prior. Juneteenth is an acknowledgment of the truth of our Nation's history. It is about realizing the idea that America was founded on: All people are created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout their lives. It is about the generations of brave Black leaders and selfless activists who never let us walk away from that idea, including Ms. Opal Lee, whom I awarded the Medal of Freedom for her work as the grandmother of Juneteenth, and former State Representative Al Edwards, who authored the bill to designate it a holiday in Texas.\n\nMy Administration is working to ensure we continue to deliver on that idea -- creating a country that truly stands for freedom, justice, dignity, and opportunity for all. Today, record numbers of Black Americans have jobs and health insurance, and Black business ownership is growing at the fastest pace in over 30 years. We are investing more money than ever in Black families and communities. That includes the funding we are delivering to support predominantly Black neighborhoods that had been divided and left behind by segregation and racial discrimination, the checks we delivered that reduced Black child poverty to the lowest rate in history, the changes we have made to the appraisals process to root out biases that put Black homeowners at a disadvantage, and the over $16 billion investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities so that we can ensure the next generation of Black leaders has equal opportunities for a quality education and pathways for economic mobility. We are working to rebuild and strengthen all of America by removing every lead pipe across our country, delivering affordable high-speed internet, forgiving $167 billion in student loan debt, and creating good-paying jobs that you can raise a family on. We are creating a new sense of pride and dignity in communities across the country.\n\nAs we work to make history, my Administration is also working to tell our Nation's history instead of erasing it. That is why I signed a law, which had been more than 100 years in the making, to designate lynching as a Federal hate crime. I designated the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument to preserve historic sites and cultural resources in Mississippi and Illinois so that we never forget the brutal lynching of Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 and the subsequent courage of his mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, who made sure our Nation would never forget her son. I have honored some of our country's greatest Black scholars, humanitarians, and artists, who dare to tell the good, bad, and truth of our Nation. We are writing new chapters of our history, and I am proud to have the most diverse Administration ever to tap into the full talents of our Nation -- including the first Black woman Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris -- and to have appointed the first Black woman as a Justice on the United States Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson. Meanwhile, we are also working to secure the right to vote -- with which anything is possible.\n\nOn Juneteenth, may we celebrate the essence of freedom that galvanized the country, the progress we have made in our Nation, and all that is possible when we march forward together. May we all recommit to redeeming the very soul of America -- choosing love over hate, unity over division, and progress over retreat.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 19, 2024, as Juneteenth Day of Observance. I call upon the people of the United States to acknowledge and condemn the history of slavery in our Nation and recognize how the impact of America's original sin remains. I call on every American to celebrate Juneteenth and recommit to working together to eradicate systemic racism and inequity in our society wherever they find it.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-eighth.\n\nJOSEPH R. BIDEN JR.\n\nMore Stories Like ThisRailway Ordered to Pay Washington Tribe $400M\n\nGathering Set to Honor White Buffalo Born in Yellowstone National Park for June 26th\n\nNative News Weekly (June 16, 2024): D.C.

When asked why Juneteenth celebrations matter, she began with a moment of levity in recalling the traditional food -- peach cobbler, barbecue chicken, potato salad, black eyed peas, watermelon. She then imagined not just one day to exalt freedom -- that highest of American values -- but 16 days of conviviality starting June 19 straight through July 4. It is in that spirit that we reproduce below General Order No. 3 issued by Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger on this day 159 years ago. Union forces, including Black soldiers, had arrived in Galveston to finally enforce the Emancipation Proclamation, which we also print below. These historic documents should be read in part because they were imperfect. Juneteenth was a step toward equality, and also a promise, which our country is still working to achieve.

How could I value being taught about something that caused so much hurt and harm?\n\nThat's when I tell them that my teachers in St. Thomas - and my fourth grade history textbook - didn't focus just on the harsh conditions of slavery. Rather, they also focused on Black freedom fighters, such as Moses Gottlieb, perhaps better known as General Buddhoe, who is credited with leading a nonviolent revolt that led to the abolishment of slavery in the Danish-ruled West Indies on July 3, 1848. The historic date is now observed and celebrated in the United States Virgin Islands as Emancipation Day.\n\nThe holiday - and the lessons I learned about it - instilled in me a sense of cultural pride and gave me a better appreciation for the sacrifices that Black people made for freedom. It also encouraged me to always push on when faced with challenges.\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because I believe Juneteenth - which commemorates the date in 1865 when Union troops notified the last remaining slaves in Texas that they were free - holds similar promise for Black students throughout the United States.\n\nStudents often tell me that they're not learning much about slavery beyond the suffering and harsh conditions that it involved. As a historian who specializes in how slavery is taught in K-12 classrooms, I believe there are several ways educators can incorporate Juneteenth into their instruction that will give students a broader understanding of how Black people resisted slavery and persevered in spite of it. Below are just a few.\n\nAs early childhood experts assembled by the National Museum of African American History point out in a guide they created to help develop lessons about Juneteenth, children in the U.S. will probably hear about slavery by age 5. But lessons about slavery at that age should avoid the pain and trauma of slavery. Instead, the lessons should celebrate and teach stories of Black culture, leadership, inventions, beauty and accomplishments. This, the authors of the guide say, will better equip children to later hear about, understand and emotionally process the terrible truths about slavery.\n\n\"Juneteenth events can be wonderful opportunities to introduce the concepts of slavery with a focus on resilience and within an environment of love, trust, and joy,\" the guide states.\n\nMany Juneteeth celebrations not only commemorate the end of slavery, but they also honor the generations of Black men and women who have fought to end slavery and for racial justice. As Black history education professor LaGarett King puts it, Black people have always \"acted, made their own decisions based on their interests, and fought back against oppressive structures.\" Stressing this can help students to see that although Black people were victimized by slavery, they were not just helpless victims.\n\nJuneteenth provides opportunities to acknowledge and examine the legacies of Black freedom fighters during the time of slavery. These freedom fighters include - but are not necessarily limited to - Frederick Douglass, Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vesey, Harriet Tubman, Nat Turner and Sojourner Truth.\n\nJuneteenth can also be a way for educators to help students better understand contemporary demands for racial justice. That's what George Patterson, a former Brooklyn middle school principal, did a few years back at the height of protests that took place under the mantra of Black Lives Matter.\n\nPatterson has said he believes that when students study Juneteenth, they are \"better equipped to understand the historical underpinnings of what's going on in the streets and to put the demands being made in context.\"\n\nTeachers need not wait for Juneteenth to be included in textbooks in order to draw lessons from the holiday.\n\n\"If it's not in the textbook, then we need to introduce it, we need to teach it,\" Odessa Pickett, a teacher at the Barack Obama Learning Academy in Markham, Illinois, stated during an interview about teachers infusing Juneteenth into their lessons. \"We need to bring it to the forefront.\"\n\nEducators can make Juneteenth about so much more than the end of slavery. Teaching lessons about the holiday offers an abundance of opportunities about what it means to fight for freedom and maintain a sense of self-determination in the face of oppression.", "source":

Once I learned the story, it was humbling; it gave me some perspective. It gave my family [a] place in the story of the nation, and it was not what I expected. When you are a Black man with roots in the South, you think you know what the story is. And I didn't.\"\n\nIn partnership with the International African American Museum and renowned genealogist Dr. Shelley Murphy, Blackwell learned that he descended from a woman named Sarah, who was born free in the early 18th century but had to appeal for her freedom when she was illegally sold into slavery. Then, Sarah's daughter Rachel had to go through that same process herself with her own children when she was sold from her family before they were able to regain their freedom.\n\n\"I was just dumbstruck. I get kind of misty. I felt really overwhelmed with gratitude that that there were women who would take that risk,\" Blackwell confided to The Daily Beast.\n\nHe and other members of his family have that paperwork framed in their homes as a reminder of who they come from and the legacy they've carried forward.\n\n\"That one document is not just a reminder of what Sarah invested or what Sarah risked; it is a reminder of all the women between Sarah and me and what they have put on the line and what they have risked and what they have invested.\n\n\"They never knew that slavery would end, but to do it for their children and their children's children and for generations to come, it really is kind of overwhelming,\" Blackwell said, adding that taking care of the next generation has been a pattern his family has continued, even when it came to him pursuing his journalistic dreams in a single-parent household.\n\nThis Juneteenth, Remember the GOP Is the Neo-Confederate Party\n\n\"It is a reminder to me not to squander... opportunity and education and investment and not take for granted the position that I have,\" he said. \"[My family] cherish[es] that -- not just as an heirloom, but as a living reminder of the people who invested so much into us.\"\n\nDespite having ancestors who were freed prior to the Emancipation Proclamation, Juneteenth still holds a deep meaning for Blackwell, which he considers to be an ever-evolving holiday.\n\n\"Juneteenth is a holiday for everyone to celebrate freedom, and as I learned my own story, it kind of encouraged me to learn more, and there are more stories coming, but also to encourage people to also find their own stories of freedom,\" he said. \"There are fights for freedom today. The fight for freedom did not end in 1865.\"\n\nHe added that freedom extends beyond the concept of bondage, but also branches into the freedom of education, sexuality and personal identity, and political rights and opportunities.\n\nCan We Admit Mainstreaming Juneteenth Has Been a Disaster?\n\nFor years, \"Godmother of Juneteenth\" activist Opal Lee continuously pushed for Juneteenth to be made a national holiday. The national recognition finally happened in 2021 under President Joe Biden, following 2020's tumultuous summer of racial reckoning after the highly publicized brutal deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd. The day, which is a culmination of the words \"June\" and \"nineteenth,\" commemorates the end of African American enslavement.\n\nEchoing the philosophy of Lee, Blackwell stated that \"Juneteenth celebrates the freedom of the people; the Fourth of July -- Independence Day -- celebrates the freedom of the land.\"\n\nHe added that the concept of celebrating Juneteenth is still new, but he will take the time to honor his ancestors -- those born free and those who were enslaved.\n\n\"There will be a moment in which I take some time out to thank [my great-grandmothers] and those generations who worked for my freedom and for those on another bloodline that persevered and survived because one contribution is no greater than the other,\" he vowed. \"I am grateful that [my ancestors] sued for their freedom, and in turn, my freedom, but I am just as grateful to those ancestors who survived freedom, who survived slavery, who persevered and did not live to 1865, did not live to emancipation. So, there will be a moment in which I express my gratitude... to all of those who came before.\"\n\nThe host of First of All with Victor Blackwell, which airs Saturdays at 8am E.T. on CNN, said he hopes that Juneteenth becomes a holiday \"that the entire country can celebrate, not just in Black households.\"\n\n\"Juneteenth is a holiday for everyone to celebrate freedom, and as I learned my own story, it kind of encouraged me to learn more,\" he said. \"There are more stories coming, but also to encourage people to also find their own stories of freedom.\"\n\nForget the Fourth of July -- It's Time to Celebrate Juneteenth\n\nSince Juneteenth became a national holiday, Blackwell, a Baltimore-native with Virginia roots, has held special programming to honor the day. In this year's upcoming Juneteenth celebration, which airs Wednesday at 10pm, Blackwell speaks with Lee, powerhouse vocalist Patti LaBelle, EGOT-winner John Legend, and legendary songwriter and singer Smokey Robinson about their experiences being Black in America and working to overcome social injustices.\n\nIn that respect, Blackwell said that every person's method to honor the past is unique to their own story and lineage.\n\n\"I don't know that freedom divides, and there will be naysayers for and about any and everything,\" Blackwell said. \"But at the very least, can we not unite around a celebration of freedom as both the freedom of the people and the freedom of the land?\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

General Gordon Granger, entered Galveston, Texas. There, some 1,600 miles from his hometown -- the aptly named Joy, New York, in nearby Wayne County -- Granger and his force of nearly 2,000 Union soldiers found the last bastion of slavery in the war-torn nation.\n\nMore than two-and-a-half years after President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, an estimated 250,000 enslaved Blacks still toiled for \"King Cotton\" under the bondsman's whip in the sweltering Texas heat.\n\nIn accordance with his duties, Granger issued \"Order Number 3\" informing the people of Texas that \"in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free.\"\n\nThe joyful news of their emancipation spread like wildfire from Granger's headquarters on Galveston Island, as Union soldiers marched through the streets reading the revolutionary order.\n\nActual freedom for many, however, was still a long way off.\n\nAs noted historian Henry Louis Gates has written, the implementation of Granger's order was not \"instant magic\" for the enslaved people of Texas. In fact, the newly freed people faced violent retribution, including threats of mob attacks and lynching, and many plantation owners tried to delay the news of emancipation until after the upcoming harvest or until they were forced to comply by an Army representative.\n\nDespite these harsh realities, the unbridled joy of those souls that first heard the news was overwhelming.\n\nAccording to one published account passed on through the generations, \"they whooped and hollered and bored holes in trees...and stopped it up with powder and light\" creating improvised fireworks to aid in the celebration.\n\nAnother celebration on that same day took place next year.\n\nFrom these humble beginnings in Galveston Bay, amidst incredible violence, intimidation, and discrimination, African Americans all over the United States transformed Juneteenth into an annual national rite and the primary commemoration of the end of slavery, in what Henry Louis Gates rightly calls one of the \"most inspiring grass roots efforts of the post-Civil War period.\"\n\nThe ratification of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery in December 1865, only six months after Granger delivered the news of emancipation to enslaved Texans, finally made the abolition the supreme law of the land.\n\nDuring the Reconstruction period, which lasted from 1865 until 1877, African Americans in Central New York continued to celebrate the end of slavery with annual gatherings on or around January 1.\n\nYet, new battles over civil rights occupied much of their efforts and ultimately provided the Black community and their allies with even more reasons for celebration.\n\nThe ratification of the 14th Amendment in 1868, which, among a host of other things codified the concept of birthright citizenship, thereby recognizing the citizenship of millions of Black Americans, and the 15th Amendment (1870), which recognized African American men's right to vote, were both celebrated with much fanfare here.\n\nOn June 7, 1870, Syracuse's approximately 450 Black citizens held a \"grand celebration\" of the \"passage of the 15th Amendment and the endowment of all their rights and privileges of free and independent citizens,\" at Kaiser's Grove.\n\nThat same evening, a large crowd gathered inside Shakespeare Hall, in the Bastable Block on East Genesee Street, to hear two incredible men speak. The Hon. Hiram Revels, U.S. Senator from Mississippi, who, in January 1870, become the first African American selected to that body in American history, and Rev. Henry Highland Garnet, the well-known African American abolitionist preacher, who had attended the National Convention of Colored Men in Syracuse in October 1864.\n\nDuring that stay, Rev. Garnett had been attacked by a group of racist \"rowdies,\" who stole his cane and threw his papers into the Erie Canal.\n\nThankfully, no such violence visited the 1870 gathering. According to press reports, the event was well attended and a great success. It did not, however, become an annual celebration in and around Syracuse.\n\nOver the ensuing decades, Black Americans in the region continued to celebrate emancipation in a variety of ways, although Juneteenth garnered little, if any, coverage in the local press.\n\nIn 1881, the Syracuse Journal reported on the large fete planned in Geneva, of which many Black Syracusans planned on attending.\n\n\"Emancipation Day,\" the Journal informed its readers, \"is the Colored people's Fourth of July.\" The Journal writer, like so many other Americans, was unsurprisingly unaware of Juneteenth.\n\nOver a century later, Risha Enzi, a member of Syracuse's Juneteenth Committee, reiterated that important point. Ms. Enzi told The Post-Standard, \"It is our Fourth of July, our Independence Day.\"\n\nEnzi was part of a group of Syracusans that organized a city-wide Juneteenth Celebration in 1988. As was the case in the 1880s, many Central New Yorkers had no real awareness of Juneteenth or what a significant day it had become for millions of their fellow Americans over the past 125 years.\n\nGeorge Kilpatrick, Syracuse's minority affairs director at the time and another driving force behind the new city-wide celebration, was inspired by the stories he read about celebrations in Buffalo and from folks in this community about the festivities many attended as children decades earlier.\n\nAmong these was eighty-six-year-old, John Williams. Mr. Williams told a reporter that he fondly recalled the annual \"Emancipation Picnic,\" where \"Colored people from all over Central New York came.\"\n\nBy the 1950s, some of the younger generation, like Jeanette Brown, looked forward to the annual June picnic at Sylvan Beach. Yet, even as a youngster, Brown recognized something was special about the event. \"People got all dressed up to go. Black people everywhere were invited. It felt like the Fourth of July.\"\n\nThe need for a separate \"Fourth of July\" may strike some readers as surprising or even divisive.\n\nYet, recall that the in the Supreme Court's infamous \"Dred Scott\" decision in 1857, Chief Justice Taney declared that persons of African descent were not citizens. And even after the ratification of the 14th Amendment remedied this odious legal decision, for many Black Americans over the course of the last 248 years, the nation's birthday was an annual reminder of their denizen status.\n\nThis sentiment was exquisitely articulated by Frederick Douglass in what was arguably his most famous speech, given just a short ride west on the Erie Canal, in Rochester.\n\nOn July 4, 1852, eleven years before he was scheduled to speak at Syracuse's very first Emancipation Jubilee, Douglass asked his predominately White audience a profound rhetorical question, \"What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July?\" He answered, \"a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty to which he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham.\"\n\nThe news of freedom celebrated in Clinton Square last Friday, that Maj. Gen. Granger carried into Galveston on June 19, 1865, marked another critical step forward on that long and winding road to remedying that gross injustice; a road that we must continue to walk together, stumble though we may.\n\nIn a poetically tragic coincidence, the nation celebrates both Juneteenth and Father's Day within days of each other. Let this convergence act as a poignant and heartbreaking reminder that the gross injustice Douglass spoke of destroyed families and ripped fathers from sons for well over two centuries by the time Granger rode into Galveston him the joyful news of freedom.", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and barbecues. In the beginnings of the holiday celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, the outdoors allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states, controlling whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast week, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. Singers Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle were among the the lineup of well-known artists from gospel, rap, jazz and other genres. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.", "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Codes_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Codes (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kirk Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_LaBelle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patti LaBelle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladys_Knight", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gladys Knight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gospel music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jazz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Festivals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 162, "textEnd": 169}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

This federal holiday, marking its third annual observance, serves as a powerful reminder of the enduring struggle for freedom and justice.\n\nOn June 19, 1865, US Army Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger informed the enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, that they were free, effectively enforcing the Emancipation Proclamation signed by President Abraham Lincoln, who was assassinated 65 days earlier. This day, celebrated as Juneteenth, symbolizes the end of slavery and the beginning of a long journey toward equality.\n\nSlavery was formally abolished in different parts of the Middle East and North Africa at various times throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Tunisia was the first country in the MENA region to abolish slavery, doing so in 1846. In Egypt, it was officially abolished in 1877. The Ottoman Empire, which controlled much of the region, banned the practice in 1882. Saudi Arabia and Yemen officially abolished slavery in 1962. Mauritania was the last country in the world to abolish slavery, officially outlawing the practice in 1981. It subsequently criminalized slavery in 2007. Despite these legal steps, Mauritania continues to grapple with deeply entrenched practices of modern slavery, with reports indicating that it still persists in various forms.\n\nDespite legal abolitions, modern forms of slavery, such as human trafficking and forced labor, continue to exist in some areas. Reports indicate that countries like Libya, with its ongoing conflict, and certain Gulf states, with exploitative labor practices, still face significant challenges in eradicating these practices.\n\nAt The Media Line, we are dedicated to the recognition and protection of basic freedoms and rights, including our own exercise of freedom of the press, especially in the Middle East and North Africa, where these are not always guaranteed.\n\nOur mission aligns with the core values highlighted by Juneteenth: the pursuit of freedom, the resilience to overcome oppression, and the unwavering commitment to justice and equality.\n\nChampioning journalistic ethics is at the heart of our work. Just as Juneteenth celebrates the triumph over injustice, we strive to uphold truth and integrity in our reporting. Our dedication to providing quality journalism ensures that the stories of the Middle East and North Africa are told with accuracy, depth, and fairness.\n\nJuneteenth also reminds us of the importance of cultural heritage and the resilience of those who fight for their rights. This resonates deeply in regions like the Middle East and North Africa, where diverse communities continue to seek their voices and stories to be heard.\n\nAs we honor Juneteenth, let us reflect on its themes of freedom, resilience, and justice, and renew our commitment to these principles in our reporting.

It has been updated and is being republished today as the nation celcbrate the Juneteenth fedeal holiday.\n\nOpinion. President Joe Biden signed the legislation into law three years that makes Juneteenth a national holiday. Juneteenth, also called Freedom Day, celebrates June 19, 1865, the date the people of Texas were informed slavery was over.\n\n\"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.\"\n\nNever miss Indian Country's biggest stories and breaking news.

Gordon Granger delivered the message in General Orders, Number 3:\n\n\"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves, and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employer and hired labor. The freedmen are advised to remain quietly at their present homes and work for wages. They are informed that they will not be allowed to collect at military posts and that they will not be supported in idleness either there or elsewhere.\"\n\nThe Order arrived two and half years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863 and two months after the Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrender that ended the Civil War at Appomattox two months earlier.\n\nEven without the modern technology of the internet, social media and 24-hour cable news, the lag in time is almost laughable today. The Texas leaders back then really didn't want the Civil War to be over and certainly did not want slavery to end. Someone could have sent a telegram earlier or could have played an 1860s version of Paul Revere on horse to tell Texans the news earlier.\n\nPerhaps there is something in Texas that has lingered through decades that makes Texas leaders resistant to good race relations. Two days before President Biden signed the Juneteenth legislation, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a Republican controversial bill into state law that bans Texas educators from teaching about racism in classrooms.\n\nWhile the bill does not specifically mention \"critical race theory,\" it has been labeled an anti-critical race piece of legislation.\n\nCritical race theory is an academic concept that claims racism is a social construct that did not originate through an individual bias or prejudice.\n\nThere are some who don't want teachers to discuss racism in public classrooms.\n\nThe Texas bill had compromises inserted by Democratic lawmakers into the law, such as being able to teach about White supremacy. This irritated Abbott who vowed to have the legislature send him a stronger version for his signature spelling out that race relations cannot be taught in public schools.\n\nAbbott is among several Republican governors who want to forbid critical race theory taught to students. These Republicans act if racism did not exist in the United States. This erasure of reality is called whitewashing history.\n\nBecause of this big pushback by Republican-controlled legislatures and governors, I was happy that Juneteenth became a federal holiday. It should be noted that Biden's signature will not solve race relations in the United States.\n\nIn recognition of Juneteenth, the National Congress of American Indians issued a statement:\n\n\"Today we honor and celebrate Juneteenth as a national holiday. On June 19th, 1865, Union troops arrived in Galveston, Texas with the news the Civil War ended and slaves were now free.\n\nA Civil War continues to this day. It never really ended. Truth be told, we remain sharply divided as a country and, along with our Black brothers and sisters, we have yet to break free from the shackles of centuries of systemic and institutional racism, oppression, and marginalization.\n\nOur day of freedom and emancipation will no doubt come. Until then, we will continue to speak our painful truths, demand justice and equality for all, and rise toward God's perfect glory for each of us, individually, and this great nation, collectively.\n\nThe Juneteenth national holiday is not an end of a long history of poor race relations in the United States, but certainly provides a time of remembrance and should shed a light on how much progress is still needed.\n\nThay\u00e9k gde nw\u00e9nd\u00ebmen - We are all related.\n\nAbout the Author: \"Levi \\\"Calm Before the Storm\\\" Rickert (Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation) is the founder, publisher and editor of Native News Online.

His owner, Singleton Vaughn, freed him in 1855, just six years before the start of the Civil War.\n\nA second manumission document, dated to 1853, was presented to the county by the Vacaville Museum in 2011.\n\nManumission is the legal term for granting freedom to a slave.\n\nNow, 17 years after Sharon McGriff-Payne, of Vallejo, had discovered the Willis document as part of a research project, Solano County on Monday hoisted the Juneteenth flag over its administration building plaza for the first time.\n\nMore than three dozen people attended the event organized by District 3 Supervisor Wanda Williams.\n\n\"Today's ceremony was very meaningful, very beautiful,\" said Williams, who was happy with the turnout and expects the ceremony to grow even more next year.\n\nThe flag will fly until June 24.\n\n\"The official colors of the Juneteenth flag incorporate the red, white and blue colors of the American flag, a reminder to all that former slaves and their descendants are Americans. The five-point star in the center symbolizes the state of Texas, where the last Black people held as slaves were freed by the Union Army. The larger bursting outline surrounding the smaller star symbolizes freedom and a new beginning for the Black people of Galveston and throughout the country,\" organizers of the event said in a statement.\n\nThe ceremony marks the 159th anniversary of when 2,000 Union troops arrived at Galveston Bay, Texas, to inform 250,000 enslaved Black individuals - and those who enslaved them - that by executive decree, all were free. That was in 1865.\n\nThe announcement came about 2\u00bd years after President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863, which in all, freed more than 4 million enslaved people, recognizing them as citizens rather than property.\n\nSome research puts the total number of slaves in the United States at close to 10 million, the University of Minnesota reported.\n\nThe ratification of the 13th Amendment on Dec. 6, 1865, abolished slavery in the United States. President Joe Biden issued a proclamation declaring Juneteenth as a federal holiday on June 18, 2021.\n\nSince then, flag raising ceremonies have taken place across the country to commemorate Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day.\n\nThe official holiday is \"Juneteenth National Independence Day.\"\n\nWilliams is the first Black woman to be elected to the board and just the second to serve. Osby Davis was the first Black supervisor. Ruth Forney served as an appointed supervisor. Cassandra James joins the board in January, having won the District 1 seat in March.\n\nNikila Gibson-Walker, president of the Tri-City NAACP, Jacalyn Eyvonne, a Vallejo poet laureate, and Suisun City poet laureate, David \"Excalibur\" Camper, were special guests at the event.

Civic Center employees say the events are all educational and there is something for everyone to enjoy.\n\n\"The Juneteenth celebration here in the city, this is the third year that we've done it...it is a collaboration between lots of entities here in the community,\" said Oz Roberts, co-chair of Juneteenth celebrations.\n\n\"This week, we have an amazing lineup of events,\" said Kanise Wiggins, assistant director of Columbus Civic Center. \"So, tomorrow we will be doing the historic bike ride and we also have the Juneteenth Jubilee block party and parade.\"\n\nWiggins says last year's jubilee had over 3,000 people in attendance during the day. She wants those who will attend the events this week to learn about the history of Columbus as well as Juneteenth.\n\n\"We have so many events that will teach people more about the importance of Juneteenth and also just come out for celebration and enrich culture,\" Wiggins added.\n\nOne of the many events taking place this week is the historic bike ride, hosted by Bicycle Columbus president John Jackson.\n\nJackson says they will be going on a bike ride through uptown Columbus and will make frequent stops at various locations to educate those in attendance.\n\n\"We're going to be going to places like the Liberty Theatre, Ma Rainey's House, and at each stop, we're gonna have volunteers working with AFLAC,\" Jackson said. \"They've got volunteers at each of the sites that are going to meet us and then tell us about what the site is.\"\n\n\"We want the community to come out and celebrate with us to learn, to experience the fun that we have,\" said Roberts. \"All of the events that we got are really really fun and diverse events.\"\n\nTuesday's bike ride will be followed by a block party and a night parade in celebration of Juneteenth.", "source": {"uri": "wtvm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.wtvm.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Civic_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Civic Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal holidays in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty Theatre"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Pride_Celebrations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Pride Celebrations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Customer_Service/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Customer Service/Conferences", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Handicapped_and_Therapeutic_Riding", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Handicapped and Therapeutic Riding", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://gray-wtvm-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/NXRLBS3NMZDZFPE3SVVR6TDRS4.jpg?auth=569672e02208dd4161b2eb3f39827e4c1a1885ea42d59346c21d99c36710ab7e&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

(Getty Images)\n\nWhenever I tell high school students in classes I visit that I appreciated learning about slavery as a child growing up in the Caribbean, they often look confused.\n\nWhy, they ask, did I like learning about slavery given that it was so horrible and harsh? How could I value being taught about something that caused so much hurt and harm?\n\nThat's when I tell them that my teachers in St. Thomas - and my fourth grade history textbook - didn't focus just on the harsh conditions of slavery. Rather, they also focused on Black freedom fighters, such as Moses Gottlieb, perhaps better known as General Buddhoe, who is credited with leading a nonviolent revolt that led to the abolishment of slavery in the Danish-ruled West Indies on July 3, 1848. The historic date is now observed and celebrated in the United States Virgin Islands as Emancipation Day.\n\nThe holiday - and the lessons I learned about it - instilled in me a sense of cultural pride and gave me a better appreciation for the sacrifices that Black people made for freedom. It also encouraged me to always push on when faced with challenges.\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because I believe Juneteenth - which commemorates the date in 1865 when Union troops notified the last remaining slaves in Texas that they were free - holds similar promise for Black students throughout the United States.\n\nStudents often tell me that they're not learning much about slavery beyond the suffering and harsh conditions that it involved. As a historian who specializes in how slavery is taught in K-12 classrooms, I believe there are several ways educators can incorporate Juneteenth into their instruction that will give students a broader understanding of how Black people resisted slavery and persevered in spite of it. Below are just a few.\n\nAs early childhood experts assembled by the National Museum of African American History point out in a guide they created to help develop lessons about Juneteenth, children in the U.S. will probably hear about slavery by age 5. But lessons about slavery at that age should avoid the pain and trauma of slavery. Instead, the lessons should celebrate and teach stories of Black culture, leadership, inventions, beauty and accomplishments. This, the authors of the guide say, will better equip children to later hear about, understand and emotionally process the terrible truths about slavery.\n\n\"Juneteenth events can be wonderful opportunities to introduce the concepts of slavery with a focus on resilience and within an environment of love, trust, and joy,\" the guide states.\n\nMany Juneteeth celebrations not only commemorate the end of slavery, but they also honor the generations of Black men and women who have fought to end slavery and for racial justice. As Black history education professor LaGarett King puts it, Black people have always \"acted, made their own decisions based on their interests, and fought back against oppressive structures.\" Stressing this can help students to see that although Black people were victimized by slavery, they were not just helpless victims.\n\nJuneteenth provides opportunities to acknowledge and examine the legacies of Black freedom fighters during the time of slavery. These freedom fighters include - but are not necessarily limited to - Frederick Douglass, Gabriel Prosser, Denmark Vesey, Harriet Tubman, Nat Turner and Sojourner Truth.\n\nJuneteenth can also be a way for educators to help students better understand contemporary demands for racial justice. That's what George Patterson, a former Brooklyn middle school principal, did a few years back at the height of protests that took place under the mantra of Black Lives Matter.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license. Read the original article.\n\nPatterson has said he believes that when students study Juneteenth, they are \"better equipped to understand the historical underpinnings of what's going on in the streets and to put the demands being made in context.\"\n\nTeachers need not wait for Juneteenth to be included in textbooks in order to draw lessons from the holiday.\n\n\"If it's not in the textbook, then we need to introduce it, we need to teach it,\" Odessa Pickett, a teacher at the Barack Obama Learning Academy in Markham, Illinois, stated during an interview about teachers infusing Juneteenth into their lessons. \"We need to bring it to the forefront.\"\n\nEducators can make Juneteenth about so much more than the end of slavery. Teaching lessons about the holiday offers an abundance of opportunities about what it means to fight for freedom and maintain a sense of self-determination in the face of oppression.", "source":

Gretchen Whitmer making it an official state holiday last year.\n\nThe University of Michigan, Western Michigan University, Eastern Michigan University and Central Michigan University are among those that do not give the day off to employees.\n\nMichigan State University does - sort of. Instead of employees having that day off, they have two floating holidays in addition to the holidays they have off, which include holidays like Memorial Day and Thanksgiving. MSU employees can choose to use their floating holidays to take days like Juneteenth, Yom Kippur and Veterans Day off.\n\nMSU Vice President of Communications Emily Guerrant said that this was announced in early 2023 and is meant to allow employees time they can use for any day that is important to them.\n\nWayne State University and Lansing Community College do give employees the day off, and several K-12 school districts have begun recognizing the day and giving their employees time off.\n\nIn October 2022, former Wayne State University president M. Roy Wilson announced that employees would have the holiday off the following year.\n\n\"I encourage you to take advantage of this time off to learn about our nation's fraught history for African Americans and reflect on the of our hard-fought freedom.\" Wilson said in a email to the university community.\n\nThe Michigan Association of State Universities does not offer a specific recommendation. Daniel Hurley, the CEO, said in an email that \"[a]s an association, we do not have a position on the Holiday; it is up to the institutions themselves to set policy.\"\n\nJuneteenth, or June 19, marks the day in 1865 that enslaved Black Americans in Galveston, Texas, were informed that they were freed, more than two months after the end of the Civil War.\n\nWhitmer signed bipartisan legislation last July declaring June 19 as an official state holiday. State of Michigan employees do not work that day. The date was declared a federal holiday in 2021.\n\nIn February, Lansing School District Superintendent Ben Shuldiner said that the district would be giving the day off to all employees.\n\nBy making the date a district holiday, the district will now be able to give students and staff the day off to \"reflect, enjoy, and celebrate the holiday outside of a school setting,\" officials said in a release.\n\n\"This decision by the Board of Education reflects our commitment to honoring and celebrating the importance of Juneteenth in American history,\" Shuldiner then said in a statement. \"By making Juneteenth a school district holiday, we acknowledge the significance of emancipation in our country's shared history.\"\n\nContact Sarah Atwood at satwood@lsj.com.

Thompson Jr., of Kansas City, Mo., who will join him on the walk from Galveston to Houston.\n\nPhiladelphia \"walking artist\" Ken Johnston flew to Texas on Tuesday to get a start on a 51-mile Juneteenth Emancipation Walk in the state where the holiday started.\n\nOn June 19, 1865, about 2,000 Union troops, under the command of Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger, arrived in Galveston to announce General Orders No. 3, a decree declaring freedom for enslaved Black people in Texas.\n\nIt was not true that news of the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation had traveled slowly to Texas, according to the Zinn Education Project: It was about people in power keeping knowledge from Black people that they should have been freed two years earlier by the Emancipation Proclamation on Jan. 1, 1863.\n\n\"When the order was read, over 250,000 Black people were freed across Texas,\" Johnston said.\n\nAt the time, Houston was a small farming community and Galveston was the largest city in the state, with wealthy landowners, he said.\n\nJohnston, 63, describes himself as a \"walking artist,\" who has made several long-distance walks marking civil rights, Underground Railroad, and abolition history. He founded Our Walk to Freedom to document his travels.\n\nIn Texas, Johnston will meet longtime friend and Texas native Frank E. Thompson Jr., of Kansas City, Mo., who will join him on the 51-mile walk from Galveston to Houston. The walk will end in Freedmen's Town, a historic district in Houston where Black people, fleeing plantations in East Texas, started arriving in 1866 and built their own neighborhood.\n\nThompson, 57, grew up in Fort Worth celebrating Juneteenth, but never really learned the full story until he went to college.\n\n\"The history is not taught in schools,\" said Thompson, the cofounder and CEO of a consulting firm in Kansas City.\n\nFor years, he did not realize that Juneteenth was unique to Texas, the last holdout among the Confederacy.\n\n\"That was upsetting, because up until high school, I actually thought Juneteenth was the end of slavery for the whole nation,\" Thompson said.\n\nThe friends planned to make a short walk from Galveston to La Marque, Texas, on Tuesday evening. And on Juneteenth, they will start from La Marque to Houston, walking at least 12 miles a day, arriving there on Monday. To beat expected record-breaking Texas heat, Johnston said they will walk twice a day, early in the morning, from 5 to 9 a.m. and in the evening, from 7 to 8:30 p.m.\n\nA little-known element that the Juneteenth National Observance Foundation uncovered was that there were 5,000 to 10,000 Black Union soldiers of the U.S. Colored Troops (USCT) who marched into Galveston at the same time as Granger.\n\n\"These actions provided a powerful image to the island's enslaved people, who were oblivious to the fact that they had been granted freedom by Lincoln two years prior,\" said the Juneteenth Legacy Project. The city of Galveston is located on Galveston Island, a barrier island on the Texas Gulf Coast. But there are small communities on the island that are not part of Galveston City.\n\nDespite the wording of General Orders 3, which asked Black people to remain on the plantations and get paid for their work, many people fled to different Texas communities or left the state altogether.\n\n\"For me, this walk is a chance to reconnect with my Texas roots, including ancestors who were probably part of the original Juneteenth exodus,\" Thompson said.\n\nThat exodus included some Black people who fled post-emancipation violence in Galveston and moved to Houston. Meanwhile, Johnston said the exodus went in two directions, with other Black residents leaving small towns to seek jobs in Galveston.\n\n\" READ MORE: Philly 'walking artist' arrives in St. Catharines, Ontario, where Harriet Tubman once lived\n\n\" READ MORE: Last year, Ken Johnston walked to Canada tracing Harriet Tubman's 'walk to freedom.' This week, he set out to explore Chester County's site\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation did not free enslaved people in other states, besides Texas, Johnston noted.\n\nWhen President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in September 1862, it did not go into effect until Jan. 1, 1863. But the proclamation did not apply to enslaved Black people living in states that had not joined the Confederacy.\n\nThat means enslaved people in the border states of Delaware, Kentucky, Maryland, and Missouri were also kept enslaved in 1863.\n\nJohnston believes what historian Sam Collins III told him: \"True freedom didn't really come until after the 13th Amendment was passed in December 1865.\"\n\nAfter emancipation, Texas passed laws requiring Black people to carry a pass to travel across the state, as many did, looking for work, Thompson said.\n\n\"If they didn't have a pass, either law enforcement or white militia units would detain Black people, throw them in jail, and they would be subject to convict labor,\" Thompson said. \"There was a resistance to letting go of this free labor.\"\n\nThe National Archives holds the original hand-written record of General Order No. 3, which states as follows:", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Juneteenth, which was made a federal holiday in 2021, actually celebrates the best decision America ever made, which was to free enslaved people on American soil. America as we know it today would simply not exist without that decision.\n\nThe decision to end slavery ultimately had the profound impact of making America the strongest country in the world, socially and economically. From a social perspective, participating in an institution such as slavery, which is immoral, coldblooded, and brutal, destroys the humanity of both those who enslave and the enslaved. By shedding ourselves of this monstrosity, America paved the way for its core values to guide us to become the greatest country in the world. Our core values that all people are created equal, with the unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, have become more of a reality. This decision provided the credibility for America to become a role model for democracy for the rest of the world.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, the decision to move away from an economic model that had slavery as its backbone was a brilliant decision. The economic dividends continue to reverberate through our economy to this day and into the future. Research suggests that the emancipation of enslaved people had a significant positive impact on the long-term economic growth of the United States. It is estimated that emancipation generated economic gains equivalent to up to 35% of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), making it one of the most important economic events in American history.\n\nThe economic benefits of emancipation and the benefits of reducing inequalities in today's society are the same. These benefits include increased workforce participation through a more dynamic and diverse labor force, growth of human capital via education and skill development, significant contributions to the economy through entrepreneurship and business development, expanding the consumer market, driving demand, and stimulating production and economic growth. A recent study by McKinsey & Company supported the strong business case for ethnic diversity \"with a 39% increased likelihood of outperformance for those (companies) in the top quartile of ethnic representation versus the bottom quartile\".\n\nWhile moving from slavery to Jim Crow muted our economic and moral development as a country, we continue to overcome the vestiges of these impediments. We have reached a critical inflection point. If we can overcome the crippling economic disadvantages and the lack of financial literacy throughout our society, we will realize the full economic benefits of our country's brilliant decision.\n\nJuneteenth also symbolizes the power of information in achieving true freedom. Juneteenth resulted from the lack of information about emancipation in Texas, underscoring the importance of information as a building block for economic prosperity. On June 19, 1865, for the first time, more than 250,000 enslaved Black Americans learned from the Union Army that arrived in Galveston Bay, Texas, that they were free. The Emancipation Proclamation had been signed two years earlier, on Jan. 1, 1863.\n\nToday, technology, in particular artificial intelligence, can empower us to overcome a lack of information (financial illiteracy), thereby unlocking the full economic potential of emancipation and ensuring a more equitable future for all. Our institutions, including banks, can use artificial intelligence and data aggregation technology to provide personalized insights, enabling people to make better financial decisions and create generational wealth.\n\nToday, we understand the significance of emancipation, not only for Black Americans but for all Americans. Therefore, our country has declared and celebrates Juneteenth as a national holiday.

Since June 19th, 1865- when it was declared that enslaved people in Galveston Bay, Texas were free- we've become college graduates, CEOs, innovators, and entrepreneurs. Additionally, we've dominated hair salons, nail shops, beauty lines, and more.\n\nAnd, in honor of Juneteenth, below, a few beauty brand founders reflect on what the important day means to them.\n\n\"Growing up as a first-generation American from Nigeria, I've had to navigate infusing American culture with my own,\" says Imevbore. One of the ways Imevbore did this was by creating a business of her own hair brand, The Weave. She provides luxurious synthetic and human hair to make wigs and other styles. Although Juneteenth wasn't a holiday Imevbore and her family typically celebrated growing up, she's found meaning in it on her own; expressing her own sense of freedom through her hair. \"Juneteenth marks a day that allowed for our collective freedom, and, as I'm building and creating a company, an experience that centers our beauty, it's something I will never forget,\" says Imevbore.\n\nFor her, creation is a fundamental form of healing through a problematic history and today's trying times. Imevbore encourages us, \"We are at a tough time culturally as we are seeing so many elements of Black culture and creativity infused in mainstream media and entertainment, while Black Americans are still fighting for fundamental rights. My words of motivation center on resilience. We have to keep creating and moving through all of the roadblocks as our ancestors have faced.\"\n\nThirteen Lune is an e-commerce one-stop shop for discovering beauty brands by Black and Brown founders. Their mission is to reframe how brands of color are received in hopes they can continue to take up space in the industry. Nyakio Grieco, the co-founder, keeps this mission in mind as she gears up for Juneteenth. Grieco tells us, \"it's a day to reflect on our community's resilience. On this day, I like to focus on our work at Thirteen Lune in building a more inclusive and equitable beauty landscape.\"\n\nWinning Newcomer Of The Year in 2021, Grieco and her team know exactly what it's like to push forward in an industry that isn't always accepting. \"Juneteenth reminds me that none of us are free until all of us are free. Equity is paramount to progress. This is at the heart of everything I do, personally and professionally.\"\n\nRebundle strives to provide quality hair products and education on how to braid our tresses. May knows how much power can form knowledge, as she hasn't always felt like she was fully educated on our history growing up. \"Unfortunately, I did not learn about Juneteenth until later in life. The school systems I went to were not particularly keen on teaching history in its entirety,\" says May. Indulging in the words of Michelle Obama, Malcolm X, and Yaa Gysai is how May continues to educate herself and feel inspired to push the Black community forward through her brand and beyond.\n\n\"There's power in how we show up and support each other, and I'm reminded of this every day as a founder in the black beauty industry,\" says May. Supporting her community has become a form of empowerment in which May has found purpose. She often appreciates the joy that has come from the Black community after all we've endured", "source": {"uri": "essence.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Essence"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galveston_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galveston Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_salon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beauty salon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Culture of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Lune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thirteen Lune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African-American culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainstream media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malcolm X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empowerment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empowerment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Branding", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Branding", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Schools", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Schools", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Hair", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Hair", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Health/Beauty/Advice", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ESSENCE-Juneteenth-2024-scaled.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

We'll start your Friday right by explaining the news, rounding up the best stories we read this week and even sharing a cocktail recipe or two.\n\nShortly after the Union won the Civil War in 1865, a Union major general issued an order: \"The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance with a proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves are free.\"\n\nJune 19, known as Juneteenth, has long been celebrated by African Americans. But in 2020, in the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic and the protests that followed the murder of George Floyd, Juneteenth took the internet by storm.\n\nMarketplace's Lily Jamali spoke with Brandon Ogbunu, professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale, who wrote about that moment for WIRED back then. He revisited what was happening at that time a year before Juneteenth became a national holiday.\n\nThe following is an edited transcript of their conversation.\n\nBrandon Ogbunu: There were a lot of conversations that were happening about who gets to be represented, who is disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. And there was an overlap in the social justice conversations between the George Floyd protests and what was happening in terms of health access and health equity and health disparities in the United States around the pandemic. So in this moment, I think, Juneteenth, which happened in the summer, just as all of this stuff was getting revving up and really getting going, it became the singular moment for everyone to kind of stop and reflect on what it meant to be an American, what citizenship was, and have we achieved the goals that were kind of articulated during and after emancipation? And you know, the answer is, no. We have a long way to go. And we saw that reflected in the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 in certain communities, native communities, black communities, Latinx communities and Pacific Islander communities.\n\nLily Jamali: And what you just laid out was everywhere on social media, we were seeing people talking about it, that dialogue was there. What kind of data do you remember seeing that showed just how viral Juneteenth had become in 2020?\n\nOgbunu: We saw with regards to Juneteenth, No. 1, it kind of always has this spike in frequency, kind of around the holiday so everyone kind of starts talking about it a little bit.\n\nJamali: Around June 19 of every year?\n\nOgbunu: June 19, every year, more or less, then it kind of goes away, and then it comes back. But in 2020, the bump was way higher than it had been. It had this very, very, very, very large spike in mentions across social media platforms that I was able to kind of identify using a set of computational tools. And this reflects, what I kind of think was a moment that captured a lot of the different tensions that were happening across these different vectors in the United States in the world, and so the it took on even more importance. Here we have a day when we can sit and talk and reflect and feel and measure and compare and think critically about where we are as a country.\n\nJamali: You have also written about the role of Black Twitter. Can you talk about how powerful Black Twitter has been as a force and maybe where it is now?\n\nOgbunu: Yeah, no, I think a lot of this goes back to Jason Parham's excellent work for Wired, who kind of wrote this famous people's history of Black Twitter, and has been the person who really kind of brought that conversation to light. Black Twitter is kind of one of the most important forces and conglomerates in all of social media. And I think it transcends just Twitter. I think it spans different social media platforms, but it's this nebulous but still very, very powerful and present collection of individuals who often use humor and satire to kind of make a point. And Black Twitter can elevate ideas, it can squash ideas. It's cancelled individuals. It's made people famous, and it can do so in relatively short term. Now, during the pandemic, when we were all frightened and we didn't know it was happening, right? Black Twitter was critical for as like anaesthetising force. It really, really made us feel calm. It made us laugh. You might have heard \"Moderna mommy,\" as a nickname for the vaccine. You might have heard the \"panorama,\" \"the panini,\" these nicknames for the pandemic. And the idea is that was Black Twitter, kind of processing what was happening at the moment. And I think Juneteenth is something that this demographic recognizes, many of them have celebrated for many, many years, and so because this demographic and this conglomerate had kind of come to prominence during the pandemic, Juneteenth as a moment kind of rode this wave. And that's another reason why you see all that amplified signal during during 2020.\n\nJamali: Do you think that Juneteenth would go viral today the way it did in that moment, in 2020 given where we are as a country, but also given how social media has changed and how the internet has changed?\n\nOgbunu: I think in 2024 I would say definitely not. And while there remains a very, very strong and robust kind of social justice movement happening, the attention has been turned to the Middle East and Gaza. But I think now the domestic conversation around second class citizenship has mostly become diluted and it's dissipated, and it isn't quite where it was four years ago, the holiday has kind of already been kind of swallowed up into the shopping machine. So we're already seeing the Juneteenth sales, really there's some disappointment when I look at kind of what's happened with the holiday, even kind of in just the first few iterations. And so I would not expect it to be viral in 2024.\n\nJamali: And to the point you just made, you wrote at the time in Wired in 2020, \"you don't need to be a cynic to predict the widespread adoption of Juneteenth will transform serious reflection on slavery into a day of cookouts, cornhole and laptop sales on Amazon.\" That line really stood out to me but does getting Juneteenth on the calendar still, does it represent a meaningful push towards something bigger, towards that real reconciliation that you talked about in your piece back then?\n\nOgbunu: I think there's something deeply powerful about federal holidays, and while it may not be what I would have hoped for it to be in 2024, it's the beginning of a conversation and not the end of one. You know, it's a lot of these things, from statues to who gets to be on a stamp. All of these things can be symbolic and pointless, but I'm not of that cynical ilk. I think when it's on the calendar and the country formally recognizes it, it's there. Now, what we do with it is up to us. And I'm hopeful that schools properly engage this holiday as a sort of Independence Day, in the sense that this is the celebration of everyone's independence, and not only one demographic. So, you know, I'm hopeful for what's to come. It just depends on what we do with it.", "source": {"uri": "marketplace.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Marketplace"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Twitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Black Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_George_Floyd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder of George Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abolitionism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Critical thinking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Holidays/Thanksgiving", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Abuse", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.marketplace.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2157115030-e1718790966304.jpg?fit=2880%2C1622&w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 427, "textEnd": 434, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

But it should also prompt us to continue the steady march of progress, so that all Americans can share the bounty of freedom and liberty which are this nation's foundational aspirations.\n\nTwo years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Declaration, freeing slaves in those states rebelling against the federal government, Union forces reached Galveston, Texas. The war was over -- the Confederates had surrendered two months earlier -- but it wasn't until U.S. Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger issued General Order No. 3 that enslaved persons in the state were informed of their freedom.\n\nThe date of that order, June 19, became an annual celebration, known as Freedom Day, Emancipation Day or, colloquially, Juneteenth. It was observed primarily among Black communities in the former Confederacy but its recognition expanded in subsequent years.\n\nIt was here in Hampton Roads, at Point Comfort, where the first enslaved Africans set foot in North America more than 400 years ago. And it was at Fort Monroe, occupying that same land, where slaves risked their lives to seize their freedom under the protection of Union forces during the Civil War.\n\nWhen Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, it was first read in Virginia under a large oak tree, which still stands proudly today on the campus of Hampton University. One can only imagine the sight of a community of people knowing their lives and their future were finally their own.\n\nThat was true, for a time. Reconstruction empowered Black Americans, inviting them to participate as full members of American society. They asserted their political will, pursued their academic aspirations and enjoyed economic opportunity.\n\nBut the door they were invited to enter slammed shut nearly as quickly as it was opened. Jim Crow laws erected barriers to vote, to own businesses and to attend schools of their choosing. Enforcement of this strict segregation came through the power of the state or the viciousness of the mob.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s forced the nation to take a hard look in the mirror. Protesters rightly asked how a nation that set forth its belief that \"All men are created equal\" could abide by a divided society and its two-tiered system of justice, commerce and democracy.\n\nTo hear some tell it today, those hard-won achievements transformed the United States into a color-blind nation. They are only too quick to repeat one line of Martin Luther King Jr.'s seminal 1963 speech in Washington, D.C., to support that assertion, ignoring his larger body of work that asked far more from his fellow Americans.\n\nThe protests in 2020 that followed the murder of George Floyd by Minnesota police officers asked similar questions of this nation -- and of all of us. How can all lives matter if Black lives are seen as disposable or inconsequential? How can we continue to turn a blind eye to their suffering? How can we continue to marginalize their remarkable contributions to the fabric of this country?\n\nThe General Assembly and former Gov. Ralph Northam made a powerful statement three years ago by designating Juneteenth a state holiday. The federal government followed a year later.\n\nWhile symbols are important and meaningful, they are no substitute for action. While the United States has made tremendous strides toward racial justice, there is still a long road to travel.\n\nAs we mark this holiday, we should celebrate that progress and pledge ourselves to moving forward, never back, in our pursuit of equality.", "source": {"uri": "pilotonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Virginian Pilot"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here's a glimpse at how it was celebrated", "body": "The annual celebration held to commemorate June 19, 1865, the date enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom, wasn't always called Juneteenth.\n\nTexas newspaper accounts from the late 1860s refer to the observance of Emancipation Day. The earliest mention found of a celebration in Fort Worth appeared in the June 21, 1881, Fort Worth Democrat, a white newspaper. It was a patronizing announcement noting, \"[we] all suppose they feel much freer, happier and better since, for the fifteenth time, they have heard the emancipation proclamation read,\" perhaps implying that there had been prior celebrations.\n\nDuring the late 1890s, the term Juneteenth began to turn up occasionally in Texas newspapers, and the Fort Worth papers made mention of celebrations every two or three years. Douglas Park, a private venture and the first park for African Americans in Fort Worth, was established in 1895 by Thomas Mason. It was named for Frederick Douglass, but the final \"s\" on his name was not used.\n\nLocated on the east side of North Main Street at North Third Street (south of where Coyote Drive-In now sits) in the Trinity River bottom lands, the park became the regular location for Juneteenth celebrations. Various railroads offered special excursion fares for \"colored citizens only,\" and many visitors came to larger towns - including Fort Worth - to celebrate.\n\nIn February 1918 the City of Fort Worth purchased Douglas Park at the urging of African American citizens and made it a city park. The city demolished the park's pavilion immediately following the 1918 Juneteenth celebration, leaving it without usable facilities. City officials were surprised that park usage dropped dramatically. The city sold the land in 1920, repurchasing it for use as a white athletic field in 1922.\n\nFor the 1919 Juneteenth celebration, Fort Worth organizers found a nearby location across Main Street and slightly south of Douglas Park. Herman Park was a private white park owned by the Texas Beverage and Cold Storage Co., formerly Texas Brewing. The managers were having a difficult time attracting events to the park. An electric plant built just to the south in 1912, construction of the Paddock Viaduct in 1913, and looming prohibition impacted both park access and desirability.\n\nFortunately Oscar C. Crook, the man pictured on the poster image that accompanies this column, worked as a messenger for Texas Beverage. He was able to negotiate a deal for use of the park. It was, alas, a one-time deal, and future Juneteenth celebrations moved to a variety of locations including Lake Como, Dixie Park, and Greenway Park.\n\nFor many years, Juneteenth was the only day of the year when African Americans could visit the Fort Worth Zoo. Interest in celebrating Juneteenth decreased in the late 1950s and early 1960s as the civil rights movement grew.\n\nIn 1972, Bob Ray Sanders wrote a Star-Telegram story about how Juneteenth celebrations had dwindled to a smaller event in Como. He recounted how Dr. Marion \"Jack\" Brooks wanted to revive Juneteenth as a way of promoting pride in black identity.\n\nIn 1974, Fort Worth celebrated the first \"Cowtown Juneteenth,\" as a way to commemorate both emancipation day and African American heritage.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery in the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_River_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trinity River (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emancipation_Proclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emancipation Proclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frederick Douglass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freemasonry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coyote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddock_Viaduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paddock Viaduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_civil_rights_movement_(1954\u20131968)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African-American civil rights movement (1954\u20131968)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth_Zoo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth Zoo"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prohibition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Como", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lake Como"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_County,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marion County, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Marion County, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dixie County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dixie County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Guides", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Skate_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Skateboarding/Skate Parks", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Celebrities", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/f0mcn9/picture243248666/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/broadside_e185_93_t4_a15_1919.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9659549", "eventUri": "eng-9659549", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-06-", "textStart": 43, "textEnd": 50}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

This event has been held each year since 2021 when President Joe Biden signed the law to make Juneteenth a federal holiday. This celebration brings Sailors together to unite as a command and as a community.\n\nMachinist's Mate 1st Class Keaira Davis, the event's master-of-ceremonies, emphasized the importance of treating everyone equally regardless of race. She highlighted the significance of practicing kindness, fairness, and avoiding judgment towards others. This aligns with the spirit of Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in America.\n\nJuneteenth traces back to June 19, 1865, when General Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, and delivered General Order Number Three, marking the official end of slavery in the last Confederate holdout. Despite being the oldest African-American holiday, it has only been recognized as a federal holiday for four years. Aviation Boatswain's Mate (Aircraft Handling) 3rd Class Jacquelyn Jacobs expressed the importance of recognizing Juneteenth as a step in the right direction towards equality.\n\nDuring the celebration, Capt. Daryle Cardone, commanding officer of Ronald Reagan, reflected on the history of Juneteenth and its significance in American history. He emphasized the ideals of equality and freedom that the Founding Fathers envisioned. Cardone urged attendees to learn more about the nation's history and recommit to the values of equality and respect for all.\n\nThe event featured a performance of \"Freedom\" by Beyonc\u00e9 by the diversity and heritage committee's choir group. Chief Air-Traffic Controller Leslie Wallace concluded the celebration by discussing the key events and individuals that led to emancipation. He emphasized the importance of treating fellow Sailors with dignity, respect, and upholding the Navy Ethos and Code of Ethics.\n\nThe USS Ronald Reagan, as the flagship of Carrier Strike Group 5, plays a vital role in supporting a free and open Indo-Pacific region. Deployed to the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations, the ship interacts with 35 maritime nations to maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific region.

This date has long-standing roots, of course. It arose particularly from the announcement of freedom to slaves in Texas on June 19, 1865. It came to symbolize black people's broader battle for liberty and its blessings in the United States.\n\nAs with nearly all things these days, there are attempts to make this day one for partisan attack. Many on the Left use it to smear conservatives as inherently bigoted. Many on the Right dismiss the day entirely as a progressive ploy.\n\nWe should resist these efforts with better endeavors of our own. Juneteenth has a legitimate and welcome place in our civic commemorations. It reminds us both of America's fallibility and its promise.\n\nJuneteenth shows us the country's fallibility in displaying the evils of slavery and its long shadow. We must not blink at that past, however long it drifts into the past.\n\nAt the same time, Juneteenth points to America's promise. This country did not create slavery, neither as an institution nor our own participation in it. Human bondage already possessed a history stretching back thousands of years, and our own slavery began when we were colonies under British control. However, America did end slavery. It did so with much bloodshed in the form of a horrific and long Civil War. It did so not to change its principles but to realize them in a fuller fashion.\n\nThe American mind, Thomas Jefferson said, was expressed in the Declaration of Independence. In that document, we committed ourselves to human equality, natural human rights, and the consent of the people in their government. All were noble goals but ones incompletely achieved in 1776 and again in 1787. Juneteenth reminds us that the Declaration was both an end and a beginning. It was an end in setting up a permanent standard of justice by which we will measure ourselves so long as this country exists. It was a beginning in that it launched us on a political voyage seeking to better realize those goods in our own laws, structures, and society.\n\nThe end of slavery comprised an enormous step in our practice toward conforming to our principles. It took the blight of slavery, with its vicious degradation of human beings, and condemned it in the strongest terms people could use -- constitutional amendment. It did not end the quest for equality and liberty. But it showed what we are capable of and affirmed we will continue to seek these goods for all people.\n\nOn this Juneteenth, we should steep ourselves in the words of a man who perhaps exemplified this fight for freedom better than any other American: Frederick Douglass. Born into slavery, he escaped to freedom to become one of the North's leading abolitionist voices. A brilliant mind and a fiery speechmaker, he proved fearless and tireless in the cause of liberating his brothers and sisters still in bondage.\n\nIn his 1852 speech, What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?, he captures the spirit of Juneteenth in a helpful way. He criticizes America for, at the time, making July 4 a white holiday, celebrating liberty while reminding black Americans of the freedom so many of them lacked. But he also noted the promise that \"interpreted as it ought to be interpreted, the Constitution is a GLORIOUS LIBERTY DOCUMENT.\" It was a North Star to guide us.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM RESTORING AMERICA\n\nDouglass lived to see this glorious liberty document made more complete in its protection of freedom.

They're realizing how each community's signature foods are more alike than they are different.\n\n\"There is no holiday that's only for African Americans, or only for Africans, or only for Caribbeans, because at the end of the day, we all are connected,\" said Asim Shakur-DuVall, cafe and catering manager of Nubian Markets, a Roxbury grocery store focused on cuisine of the Black diaspora. \"It's better to share our culture amongst each other, and expose each other to different experiences.\"\n\nJuneteenth commemorates June 19, 1865, the day that enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. The order provided by Union Major General Gordon Granger abolished slavery in the country, excluding tribal reservations.\n\nThe celebration has evolved from solemn remembrances into light-hearted jubilees, from small church gatherings to thousands-large parades. On Saturday, Bostonians gathered in Hyde Park for the fourth-annual Juneteenth Joy celebration, and Embrace Boston on Tuesday kicked off its four-day Embrace Ideas festival with an awards ceremony, panels, and a block party at multiple city locations.\n\nBut for most of the holiday's short history, what has remained relatively static is the food that people eat: barbecue, watermelon, and red drinks, rouge-hued items that represent the bloodshed of enslaved Americans, said Adrian Miller, a Denver-based soul food scholar and author of \"Soul Food: The Surprising Story of an American Cuisine, One Plate at a Time.\"\n\nIn recent years, though, food enthusiasts said the \"racial reckoning\" of 2020, and both federal and state recognitions of the holiday, have brought Juneteenth into the mainstream, and pushed new generations of people to incorporate the day into their list of annual jamborees -- and bring their own foods to the dinner table.\n\n\"Black people in Boston: they're Puerto Rican, they're Haitian, they're Jamaican. This is an immigration place,\" added Jumaada Abdal-Khallaq Henry Smith, co-chair of the Boston Juneteenth Committee, which is coordinating a flag-raising and parade in honor of the holiday on Wednesday in Roxbury.\n\nShakur-DuVall's earliest memories include his mother's rich macaroni and cheese. He remembers joking with family as they snapped collard green leaves from their strong stalks and placed them in cold water in preparation for the forthcoming potluck.\n\n\"Food has always been attached to family and fun,\" Shakur-DuVall said. \"Picking collard greens off the stem is something so simple, but it just goes to show how food can really bring people together.\"\n\nShakur-DuVall's family encouraged culinary exploration, so his dinner table was covered with dishes from different corners of the globe.\n\n\"Being around all the different cultures, being around all the different types of cuisines -- you might as well try something new,\" he said.\n\nShakur-DuVall carries his philosophy into his vision of Juneteenth, a holiday he admits he didn't know much about until researching in the stillness of the pandemic. If picked as chef for a Juneteenth feast, he would cook \"comfort food,\" which might mean his mother's creamy mac. Or, for one of Nubian Markets' many customers, hearty lamb stew with a side of injera flatbread.\n\n\"That just shows the beauty of the African diaspora and the culture that it has,\" Shakur-DuVall said.\n\nFor Gaitskell \"Chef Gates\" Cleghorn Jr., his palette was shaped by two pieces of the diaspora. He would watch his African American mother's kneading and rolling of her famous cinnamon roll dough and snag a piece to mold with his tiny hands when she wasn't looking. Or he'd savor the few days that his Jamaican father would cook homemade beef patties, because the difficult dough preparation process made it an occasional treat.\n\nBut there were influences from outside the diaspora, too; when his military family was stationed in Germany, he could \"smell the fresh baked bread from down the street.\"\n\nSuch an upbringing planted the seeds for Cleghorn's current role as a culinary instructor at the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts and founder of Delectable EATS, a company that provides catering, community outreach, and instruction services.\n\nFor the holiday, he would prepare two versions of candied yams. This, he said, shows how enslaved Africans, not finding the yams they were accustomed to on their native continent, substituted the North American sweet potato as a worthy alternative. The main dish would be jerk chicken, which gets its unique marinade and cooking method from the exchange of enslaved Africans and Indigenous people on what is now Jamaica.\n\n\"It'll give an outlet and an opportunity to tell a story, and to connect food with culture,\" Cleghorn said.\n\nSimilar to Shakur-DuVall, Cleghorn's knowledge of Juneteenth is new, but he sees its growing popularity as a positive sign.\n\n\"It's better representation. To me, it's awareness,\" Cleghorn said. \"Awareness of our history here, and awareness of our history here in Boston.\"\n\nUnlike Shakur-DuVall and Cleghorn, Glorya Fernandez's experience with Juneteenth spans decades. Fernandez, a Cambridge native, moved to Roxbury in the '90s and started attending the Juneteenth cookouts in nearby Franklin Park. The plates included the standard African American barbecue, served with maybe a Haitian rice and peas on the side.\n\n\"You can go around with the world and it's just the same food stacked in something else,\" she said.\n\nFernandez, who has Bajan, Cape Verdean, and African American roots, has some fond food memories of her aunt who \"could make Spam taste like steak,\" and \"make liver melt in your mouth.\" But there are heavy ones, too, of her mother drowning her sorrows in tubs of ice cream, and her family members battling cancer and diabetes due to what she believes was poor diet.\n\n\"There's a lot of work to be done, so I'm taking this opportunity and working with organizations like the Sierra Club, the farmers market, and in this position at the library to ignite people to investigate the nutrition and the food properties that they are ingesting,\" said Fernandez, who serves as the Boston Public Library's first chef-in-residence through its Nutrition Lab initiative.\n\nFernandez, who's created her own business, gogobytes, to provide health-conscious culinary instruction and resources to Boston residents, uses her family's knack for making flavorful food and nutritional knowledge to prepare plant-based dishes. And that's exactly what she is doing for Juneteenth with black-eyed pea fritters. Take some carrots, black-eyed peas, maybe a little sweet potato for sweetness and red chilies for spice, and bind it all with flaxseed -- \"no eggs, no dairy.\"\n\nThen coat it in crumbs and fry it in avocado oil, \"because that crisp just adds all kinds of heaven to your world,\" Fernandez said.\n\nBeyond the chance to introduce more nourishing food into people's lives, Fernandez sees Juneteenth as a day to celebrate Black people's humanity and their role as \"the original people.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [],

This movement added gravitas to the new holiday, Williams said.\n\nAs the holiday approaches, other banks and other financial institutions have also found ways to go beyond closures and commemorate the end of slavery in the U.S.\n\nChase, Wells Fargo, Citi and other federally regulated banks will be closed Wednesday in accordance with the Federal Reserve System's Juneteenth observance. Credit unions across the country, including Navy Federal, Pentagon Federal and Bethpage Federal, will also be closed for the holiday.\n\nIn an emailed statement to American Banker, JPMorgan Chase pointed to its Advancing Black Pathways commitment aimed to build on economic foundations for Black communities. The statement also said this initiative has \"supported over 16,000 Black businesses and entrepreneurs through business boot camps and coaching\" and \"committed $30 million to historically black colleges and universities,\" over the last five years and will continue these efforts.\n\nCiti held a panel discussion on June 10 in its New York headquarters -- hosted by its Black heritage network, a network for Black employees at Citi -- to promote mental well-being in communities of color ahead of the holiday. On June 13, Wells Fargo commemorated Black musical history in a two-night concert in Houston featuring an array of R&B, blues and hip-hop artists that explored the history of music as it relates to Black culture.\n\nAt OneUnited, the bank's status as a community development financial institution has been a testament to its past and continued investment in underserved Black communities, Williams said.\n\n\"Promoting financial literacy by providing loans and capital to underserved communities, is not only a good thing for our communities -- and particularly for the black communities -- but we think it's a good thing for America.\"\n\nSome fintechs have also begun to honor Juneteenth, including Paysafe, a London credit card processing company servicing small businesses globally. CEO Bruce Lowthers said Paysafe has focused its efforts on assuring that Juneteenth programs in the U.S. offices are not limited to a single day, but that they bolster diversity initiatives and create space in the office for employees' diverse identities.\n\n\"We really tried to focus all of our programs more on a kind of sustainable change versus just celebrating the holiday itself ... but we really have geared up a lot of things around the holiday,\" Lowthers said.\n\nIn addition to the day off, mentoring programs and social events, Paysafe will also host internal education sessions to inform staff on Juneteenth's historical significance, Lowthers added. He said that even for a company focused on payments, promoting diverse thoughts and celebrating the many different identities in the company is still essential.\n\n\"I thought everybody had already concluded that diversity was the best answer for business,\" Lowthers said. \"The outcomes when you bring a group of people together and they feel comfortable and have their community in the company -- to be creative and have trust in each other -- that is really where all the magic happens in business.\"", "source": {"uri": "americanbanker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Banker"},

(Reuters)\n\nA mid-week break for the US stock market investors as they will experience a shortened trading week. On Wednesday, June 19, it is officially a stock market holiday in honor of Juneteenth National Independence Day. The US stock market is closed on Wednesday, June 19th, and will reopen on Thursday, June 20th.\n\nNasdaq U.S. equities and options markets will be closed on Wednesday, June 19, 2024, in observance of the Juneteenth Holiday. However, the Nasdaq Global Index Data Service data feed product will be up and available at the Nasdaq U.S. data centers on Wednesday, June 19.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq will be closed on June 19 due to Juneteenth National Independence Day, according to the US stock market holiday list. This means that the market will reopen on June 20, Monday after it closes on June 18.\n\nNext month, there will be another stock market holiday in the first week. Nasdaq U.S. equities and options markets will be closed on Thursday, July 4, 2024, and will close early on Wednesday, July 3, in observance of the Independence Day holiday. The Nasdaq Global Index Data Service data feed product will be up and available at the Nasdaq U.S. data centers on Thursday, July 4, 2024.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite gained 1.58% and 3.24%, respectively, notching their seventh winning week in eight amid a strong rally in technology stocks. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.54% last week, its third losing week in four.\n\nThose moves came as the Federal Reserve signaled only one interest rate cut this year which could come as late as December, even as US inflation figures for May came in below market expectations.\n\nStill, enthusiasm over artificial intelligence continued to push mega-cap tech names, with strong gains last week from Nvidia (9.1%), Apple (7.9%), Broadcom (23.4%), Microsoft (4.4%) and Meta Platforms (2.3%).\n\nTrading activity is set to resume from June 20 as US markets are closed on July 19. Juneteenth, also known as Juneteenth National Independence Day, commemorates Union Army Gen. Gordon Granger's statement on June 19, 1865, that Texas was free of slavery, years after the Emancipation statement had outlawed it in that and other Southern states.\n\nOn June 17, 2021, US Congress passed legislation making it a federal holiday, and President Joe Biden signed it into law. On June 20th 2022, it is for the first time that Juneteenth is being observed as a federal holiday.\n\nBack in 2022, the question of whether the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes would send the American economy into a recession was a major topic of conversation. Today, in June 2024, the economy appears to have taken a soft landing, with the Fed signalling at least one rate drop in 2024.\n\nInvestors now look ahead to US retail sales, home sales and housing

In 2021, President Joe Biden, with Fort Worth's Opal Lee at his side, signed into law a bill declaring Juneteenth a national holiday. Lee, who long championed federal recognition of the holiday, is known as the \"Grandmother of Juneteenth.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2016, Lee made her way from Fort Worth to Washington, D.C., walking 2\u00bd miles in several cities along the way to represent the time it took for news of emancipation to reach Galveston.

I know I hated it when everyone else got those days off and I didn't. Then for several years, I got to enjoy those days off too. We knew we had several bank holidays. That hasn't changed.\n\nThere were several National and Federal holidays (New Year's Day, MLK Jr Day, Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, Columbus Day, Veteran's Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas).\n\nThere has not been another day added to that list since Martin Luther King Jr Day became a federal holiday back in 1983. That all changed back in 2021. A couple of days before June 19th, Joe Biden signed into effect for Juneteenth to become the newest holiday. So this is a newer day that you may still have not gotten used to.\n\nSo just for you to not be lost coming up on Wednesday there will be several places closed in Amarillo. It is a federal holiday so we will not be getting any mail delivered. The banks will not be open. Any federal building will be closed. You won't be summoned to jury duty that day.\n\nIt won't be long before this becomes second nature. When I mentioned this story to a coworker he even asked what holiday is this week. That is how new it was. I know I was working at a bank when it was signed into law but it was so fast and Juneteenth was in a couple of days that the bank didn't close that year.\n\nSo some places have only had it as a holiday for two years.

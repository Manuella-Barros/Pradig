The Museum of Ice Cream (MOIC), a renowned global experiential brand famous for its immersive, multi-sensory experiences inspired by ice cream, is making a sweet return to the Magic City. On September 6, MOIC will open a new permanent location at Miami Worldcenter in Downtown Miami, blending an interactive museum with a playground. Tickets are now available for purchase online.\n\nThe Museum of Ice Cream is the ultimate immersive experience where everyone can play like a kid and enjoy unlimited ice cream together. The Miami location, spanning 14,000 square feet over two floors, represents the next generation of interactive museums. It pays tribute to the city's vibrant international spirit, culture, hospitality, and love of ice cream. This new location promises to be the most playful, joyous, educational, and delicious yet, expecting visitors from over 80 countries in its first year.\n\nHighlights include the retro 'Cream Liner,' a 60's inspired luxury airplane that transports you from downtown Miami to a world of endless possibilities where anything is \"pop-sicle.\" Guests can explore 'A Grand Hall of Freezers,' filled with mysterious doors leading to surprises, wonders, and treats. Top off your adventure by sliding down a double helix slide into the world-famous sprinkle pool, designed as a tribute to the iconic Versace Mansion.\n\nTo enhance the journey through scent and taste, the Museum of Ice Cream Miami has partnered with sensory scientists at International Flavors and Fragrances to create a multi-sensory tasting experience that takes you through the flavors of the tropical city. In celebration of the opening, the Museum of Ice Cream Miami will feature new flavors from the beloved local creamery Azucar Ice Cream. Additionally, they are thrilled to serve Cosmic Bliss for the first time, featuring their new and creamy coconut-based soft serve.\n\nAdults can let their imagination soar with date nights or fun evenings out with friends. From ice cream-themed cocktails to hours of adults-only play, the Museum of Ice Cream Miami aims to inspire imagination, allowing all guests to rediscover the kid within. Adults are taken on a transformational journey, enabling them to forget their worries by utilizing the power of play -- whether swimming in sprinkles, exploring banana jungles, playing in a carnival, or indulging in unlimited ice cream.\n\nLiving in Miami, and opening a Museum at the Faena Bazaar back in 2018 was a dream for me and changed how I approached designing the past five museums we have opened around the world,\" says Maryellis Bunn, Co-Founder and Co-CEO of Museum of Ice Cream. With this Museum being a permanent build, I was able to push the boundaries of design and interactivity, making this the creamiest, most colorful, and tastiest museum yet. You'll see sensory elements from taste, touch and smell incorporated throughout,\" \"I'm also excited to collaborate with so many incredible organizations like Style Saves and Groot Hospitality with many more to come.\"\n\n\"Bringing the museum to Miami Worldcenter has been a game changer as it truly positions the Museum at the epicenter of downtown Miami and as a global arts destination.

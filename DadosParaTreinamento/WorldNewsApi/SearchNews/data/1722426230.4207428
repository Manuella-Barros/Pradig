Jack Gohlke, who starred for Oakland University during the 2024 men\u2019s NCAA Tournament, signed a non-guaranteed NBA Summer League deal with the Thunder on Friday after going unselected in the 2024 NBA Draft, his college team confirmed Friday on X. Gohlke, 24, took the college basketball world by storm in March when he led the No. 14-seeded Golden Grizzlies to an upset over the No. 3 seed Kentucky Wildcats, dropping 32 points and tying an NCAA Tournament record with 10 3-pointers. After that game, Gohlke sold his future NBA prospects short, ruling out any chance of making it as a professional one day. \u201cI know they have draft picks and I know I\u2019m not going to the NBA,\u201d Gohlke said. \u201cI know on any given night I can compete with those type of guys and our team can compete with those type of guys.\u201d The sharpshooter had a monster game once again in Round 2 of the tournament, scoring 22 points with six deep balls, although Oakland fell to NC State, which wound up making the Final Four. Gohlke spent the first five seasons of his college basketball career, including a redshirt season, at Division II Hillsdale College in Michigan before transferring to Oakland before the 2023-24 season. He became an immediate star on social media after his big game against Kentucky, going from around 500 Instagram followers to over 17,000 followers within a day. Gohlke has since secured NIL deals with Buffalo Wild Wings, TurboTax, Barstool Sports and others. The legend of Gohlke will continue in Salt Lake City on July 8 when the Thunder kick off their summer league campaign against the Jazz.", "summary": "One of March Madness\u2019 biggest stars is getting a shot at keeping his NBA dreams alive.\u00a0", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/29/sports/march-madness-sensation-jack-gohlke-signs-nba-summer-league-deal-with-thunder/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/jack-gohlke-3-oakland-golden-78792670.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:43:55", "author": "Dylan Svoboda", "authors": ["Dylan Svoboda"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.394}

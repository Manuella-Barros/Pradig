He put in a great effort and played very good tennis,\" said the second seed, who played with his right knee strapped after undergoing surgery on a torn meniscus just a month ago.\n\n\"This match potentially deserved to get into a fifth the way we both played, the way he played particularly in the fourth, but I\u00b4m very glad it didn\u00b4t.\"\n\n(Reporting by Pritha Sarkar, editing by Ed Osmond)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbs", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serbs"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_football_league_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English football league system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Challenger_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Challenger Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centre Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_fault_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double fault (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(PBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (PBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hearing loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yugoslav_Partisans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yugoslav Partisans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decibel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meniscus_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meniscus (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Juniors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707160", "eventUri": "eng-9707160", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 26, "textEnd": 32}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

For Wang, the world No\u200942, the victory was her first over a top 10 player.\n\nSeventh seed Hubert Hurkacz became the third men's top-eight player to make an early exit as he retired from his second-round clash against Frenchman Arthur Fils with a knee injury.\n\nHaving made a slow start, Hurkacz was on course to level the match at two sets apiece when he dived for a volley at the net in the fourth set tiebreak to go 8-7 up, but landed badly and stayed on the turf to receive treatment on his right knee.\n\nHurkacz limped on after a lengthy medical timeout before producing another desperate dive shortly after, but his movement was severely hampered.\n\nHe threw in the towel at 7-6(2) 6-4 2-6 6-6, having gone down 9-8 in the tiebreak.\n\n\"It's very tough to win a match like this against a friend,\" said Fils.", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATP_Challenger_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ATP Challenger Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xinyu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wang Xinyu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Fils", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthur Fils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Dart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harriet Dart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Boulter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Boulter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Hurkacz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hubert Hurkacz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volley_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volley (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_scoring_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis scoring system"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Xss-H033dpLAyasRNzmPjLlUSqMa3P5-iyUaOfYXv62i-xhFrDOPRC-SknIJEXRDsTPL7W7nVR9h7J-2bOMGHQuDjTFs92ntIznauf_xjGeK_Q=s1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707160", "eventUri": "eng-9707160", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

A coach for PLL Play and a beacon for growing the sport internationally, Callum's impact on our game will be felt forever.\"\n\nIn an Instagram story post, Callum Robinson's girlfriend, Emily Horwath, shared a touching tribute to him with a picture of them together.\n\n\"This man changed my life in ways I can't even put into words,\" Horwath wrote. \"I don't yet understand a world without him and his energy in it. I feel so grateful to have loved him.\"\n\nIn Horwarth's Instagram highlights, she shared a voice message that Robinson send to her and she captioned the post, \"will be playing this on repeat.\"\n\n\"Happy Tuesday, Good Morning,\" Robinson said in the message. \"It's 11:11 and I'm just thinking about you. Just wanted to drop you a quick message and say hello baby. Hope you're having a phenomenal start to your day. I'm sensing a big grin on your face for some reason today. I hope you're full of positivity and smiles.\"\n\nRobinson ends the message saying, \"Cheers baby. Miss ya.\"\n\nBaja chief state prosecutor Mar\u00eda Elena Andrade Ram\u00edrez said a warrant was issued for Jes\u00fas Gerardo \"N\", alias \"El Kekas\", charging him with forced disappearance of people in connection to the case. That suspect, Ram\u00edrez said, was in custody on Sunday.\n\nTwo other people, a man and a woman, had also been detained in connection to the killings, Ram\u00edrez announced. Officials did not identify the pair the the time of the announcement.\n\nRam\u00edrez said officials believed the killers saw the victims' tents and pickup truck and wanted to steal their tires, but when the victims \"came up and caught them, surely, they resisted.\"\n\nDuring her court appearance on Wednesday, Jes\u00fas Gerardo's girlfriend recalled telling investigators that Gerardo referenced the victims when when he came to her house on April 28, the BBC report said.\n\nThe girlfriend, who has only been identified by her first name Ari, told investigators that Jes\u00fas Gerardo said he did something to, \"three gringos.\"\n\nAri testified that she then asked him to clarify what he meant and he replied, \"I killed them,\" the BBC reported.\n\nAri has not been charged with the disappearance of the three men, but was named as a witness in the case, the BBC said.\n\nContributing: Natalie Neysa Alund and Krystal Nurse, USA TODAY.\n\nAhjan\u00e9 Forbes is a reporter on the National Trending Team at USA TODAY.

On April 27, the trio went missing after going on a surfing trip to Ensenada, leaving their loved ones clueless and terrified. Sadly, on Monday their bodies were found at the bottom of a well with gunshot wounds. It's suspected they were trying to stop thieves from stealing their pickup truck and were met with violence. So, so sad...\n\nThe news came as a shock to Callum's home community of Perth, and of course to his and Jake's family. But it was a shot to the heart for his girlfriend Emily Horwath, who has been mourning the unimaginable loss on social media. Emily has been trying to communicate just how much Callum meant to her, and she to him. And in his last message we think everyone understands.\n\nRelated: 4 Babies Found Dead, Wrapped In Foil In Mother's Freezer -- She WON'T Face Charges!\n\nAccording to Australia 7 News, she posted the now-vanished voice memo to her Instagram Stories. In the message, Callum can be heard welcoming his beloved to a brand new day:\n\n\"Happy Tuesday! Good morning! It's 11:11 and I'm just thinking about you. Just wanted to drop you a quick message and say hello, baby. Hope you're having a phenomenal start to your day. I'm sensing a big grin on your face for some reason today. I hope you're full of positivity and smiles. Cheers, baby. Miss ya.\"\n\nAww...\n\nIn the caption, Emily reportedly wrote:\n\n\"Will be playing this on repeat\"\n\nShe made another post in honor of the surfer, writing over a photo embracing him:\n\nThis man changed my life in a way that I can't even put into words. I don't yet understand a world without him and his energy in it. I feel so grateful to have loved him. Tell your people you love them. Live life to the fullest every day be kind to others, laugh uncontrollably. Don't let the small stuff bother you. lead with positivity. and live like Cal.\"\n\nGut-wrenching. Emily also shared a screenshot of herself and her boyfriend talking about the afterlife. Back in January, she sent a photo of the sky to Callum and texted him:\n\n\"When someone passes I always think they speak through the sky. I woke up this morning and it was bright red, beautiful. Just thought of you and your Nan this morning.\"\n\nTo which he replied:\n\n\"Thanks Babi... you're filling my heart up in all the right ways ... I'm also a big believer in the ocean and the sky being a conduit between the physical state and the spiritual state. I'm going to be doing a lot of looking out and looking up today.\"\n\nThe grief-stricken girlfriend said:\n\n\"I think that's a beautiful idea. Look for all the signs, they're there.\"\n\nSee the thread for yourself (below):\n\nIt's chilling they had this conversation not knowing what was coming. Heartbreaking!\n\nWe're sending love and light to Emily and all of the victims' loved ones. May they rest in peace and get the justice they deserve.\n\n[Image via Callum Robinson/Emily Horwath/Instagram]", "source": {"uri": "perezhilton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perez Hilton"}, "authors": [{"uri": "perez_hilton@perezhilton.com", "name": "Perez Hilton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surfing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Carter_(comedian)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Carter (comedian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensenada,_Baja_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ensenada, Baja California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ensenada, Baja California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Callum Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seven News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cheers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refrigerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refrigerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foil_(fencing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foil (fencing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/australian-surfer-final-voice-message-before-murdered-mexico.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551990", "eventUri": "eng-9551990", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 321, "textEnd": 329}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

They were discovered at the bottom of a well with gunshot wounds to the head.\n\nNow, authorities on the case have charged one individual in connection with the crime. Per a press release from the Baja California Attorney General's Office:\n\n\"For the crime of forced disappearance committed by private individuals, the Attorney General's Office of Baja California achieved the connection to the trial of Jes\u00fas Gerardo 'N', alias 'El Kekas', who will remain in preventive detention after his involvement in the crime committed to the detriment of two brothers of Australian origin and an American in Ensenada.\"\n\nAs for the motive behind the heinous crime, the press release also confirmed that the aforementioned assailant, along with others, were after the three surfers' vehicle. The statement continued: \"While the foreigners were camping, they were surprised by Jes\u00fas Gerardo 'N', and other people, with the intention of stealing their vehicle and due to the reaction of the victims, they deprived them of their lives.\"\n\nThe area is known for cartel activity, however, according to an anonymous member of the criminal organization speaking to The Daily Beast, this was not their work. In fact, the nameless, alleged cartel member said they worked with authorities.\n\n\"They were low-level robbers acting alone. But we handed them over,\" he said. \"We learned that the cops were looking for the gringos and also began looking for those who were responsible. We called the authorities to let them know where to find them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, mourning for the three continues. The parents of Jake and Callum, Australian nationals, traveled to the US and made a statement. \"Our hearts are broken, and the world has become a darker place,\" said Debra Robinson, the mother.", "source": {"uri": "surfer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SURFER Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dashel_pierson@surfer.com", "name": "Dashel Pierson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California_Peninsula", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baja California Peninsula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Carter_(comedian)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Carter (comedian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surfing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baja California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baja California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensenada,_Baja_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ensenada, Baja California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ensenada, Baja California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforced_disappearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enforced disappearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gringo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gringo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Publications", "wgt": 20}], "image": "https://www.surfer.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_xy_center%2Cq_auto:eco%2Cw_620%2Cx_440%2Cy_171/MjA2MzE2OTAwODExMDIzNTM2/ens-418.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551990", "eventUri": "eng-9551990", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

While Ari has not been charged, she was detained last week after police found she had a cellphone believed to belong to one of the victims.\n\nIn a witness statement read aloud in court Wednesday, Ari told investigators her boyfriend committed the crime over the tires on the victims' Chevrolet, per the San Diego Union-Tribune.\n\nAccording to the outlet, she claimed Gerardo took her Ford Ranger pickup on April 27, but returned with the victims' car. Ari then said that her partner told her he had \"f---ed up three gringos,\" and told her it was because \"they had a lot of money, devices, and the pickup.\" He also allegedly specified, \"I killed them.\"\n\nAri claimed, per the outlet, that the suspect said he was going to \"get rid of the pickup to Santo Tom\u00e1s,\" which is where the victims' vehicle was later discovered burned and without tires.\n\nHe reportedly gave the tires to Ari, and told her, \"Look what I brought you.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Jake and Callum's parents made an emotional public statement following their sons' death.\n\n\"The world has become a darker place for us,\" their mother, Debra Robinson, said in a video shared by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nDebra and Martin Robinson, who made the statement from the beach in San Diego, also shared their sadness over the death of their sons' friend, Jack.\n\n\"We also mourn the loss of [Jack] Carter Rhoad, a close friend. They were young men enjoying their passion of surfing together,\" Debra added.\n\nAfter arriving in California from their home in Perth, the couple travelled across the border into Mexico to identify their sons over the weekend.\n\n\"Now it's time to bring them home to family and friends and the ocean waves in Australia,\" the mourning mother said.\n\nThe murders brought a crowd of about 500 people to the streets of Ensenada over the weekend, where protesters were heard calling for an increase in security in the area. Some held surfboards with messages including \"Australia, we are with you\" and \"They only wanted to surf, and they executed them.\"\n\nLocal surfers also participated in a memorial paddle-out nearby at Playa San Miguel, with another paddle-out to honor the three men scheduled for this Saturday in San Diego.", "source": {"uri": "toofab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Toofab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_San_Diego_Union-Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The San Diego Union-Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Surfing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNSD", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KNSD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Perth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pickup truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Callum Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Ranger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Ranger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevrolet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baja California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baja California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensenada,_Baja_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ensenada, Baja California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ensenada, Baja California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surfboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.toofab.com/image/b2/16by9/2024/05/09/b210d21684334435b1e50be90227dbee_xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551990", "eventUri": "eng-9551990", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-27", "textStart": 603, "textEnd": 611, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

In fact, the nameless, alleged cartel member said they worked with authorities.\n\n\"They were low-level robbers acting alone. But we handed them over,\" he said. \"We learned that the cops were looking for the gringos and also began looking for those who were responsible. We called the authorities to let them know where to find them.\"\n\nMeanwhile, mourning for the three continues. The parents of Jake and Callum, Australian nationals, traveled to the US and made a statement. \"Our hearts are broken, and the world has become a darker place,\" said Debra Robinson, the mother.\n\nThis is still a developing story.

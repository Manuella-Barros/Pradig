For example, several have claimed that the chicken they purchased from the chain had a stringy consistency, a phenomenon known as \u201cspaghetti meat.\u201d Others have questioned the quality of their steaks, while even more users have noted concerns about the products sold under its Great Value label. Now, another internet user has shared a worry about eggs sold at the popular chain. An unusually labeled set of eggs In a video with over 50,000 views as of Saturday, TikTok user Dion (@dion.drange) shows a pack of a dozen eggs, two of which he\u2019s cracked into a bowl. \u201cI don\u2019t know what Walmart has got going on, but they\u2019re painting all these eggs,\u201d he says. Each egg has a visible red spot on top. \u201cLook, y\u2019all, the paint is coming through the eggs!\u201d he exclaims, holding an eggshell up to the camera. It does appear that the red dye can be seen inside the egg. Throughout the rest of the video and in the text overlaying it, Dion shares his concerns about the healthfulness of this dye, accusing the maker of trying to \u201cpoison us.\u201d \u201cWhat is this stuff? What is the purpose of this? All my life, eggs have never been like this,\u201d he states. He then puts some of the dye on his fingers and attempts to wash it off in the sink; the dye is not easily removed. \u201cLook at this! This, this doesn\u2019t just come off, and you know how strong that\u2019s got to be to be going through the eggshell,\u201d he declares. @dion.drange Cant even survive in peace on this planet anymore they tryna shove chemicals in ya body 24/7 #drange \u266c original sound \u2013 Dion Dion later made a follow-up video showing that the eggs in question were Eggland\u2019s Best Organic eggs. He then shows another Eggland package that says it\u2019s filled with \u201cCage Free\u201d eggs. While these eggs also have a stamp, it is significantly smaller. Still, Dion is not happy about the presence of the stamp altogether. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen, this is strong enough to bleed through the egg, so no matter how small it is, I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s safe regardless,\u201d he concludes. @dion.drange Replying to @Pollyester888 whats the purpose of stamping eggs somebody tell me please ? #drange \u266c original sound \u2013 Dion Is this egg dye safe? On the company\u2019s website, Eggland explains the purpose of the red stamp shown in the video. \u201cThe Eggland\u2019s Best logo identifies eggs that are produced according to the EB management program required for a wholesome and nutritious product,\u201d the site reads. \u201cThe program incorporates guidelines for feeding, animal welfare, housing, disease prevention, and quality control required to create an EB Egg.\u201d As for the nature of the dye itself, Eggland states that \u201cthe logo is applied by stamping machines which use an FDA-compliant, USDA-approved, food-safe ink that is acceptable as a food additive.\u201d While the company does not state why the dye is occasionally visible inside the egg, it is not uncommon, having been noted on Reddit around five years ago. As eggshells are porous, it is possible that some of the dye made its way into the egg\u2014though as the dye itself is food-safe, eating an egg with dye on its inside is overwhelmingly likely to be perfectly fine for your health. Commenters share their thoughts Although some users in the comments section expressed concern, many told Dion not to worry about the visible dye in his eggs. That said, others noted that if Dion really has a problem with this, there are ways of purchasing eggs that do not expose one to such a stamp. \u201cThat\u2019s why my eggs come straight from the chicken to the pan,\u201d wrote a user. \u201cI buy eggs from a local farm,\u201d added another. \u201cI never eat any store-bought eggs or beef anymore. i really hope you find a farmer,\u201d echoed a third.

A defensive lapse by Antonee Robinson and aimless defensive play by Johnny Cardoso, Tim Weah and Cameron Carter-Vickers led to four goals in an embarrassing 5-1 defeat to Colombia in a Copa Am\u00e9rica warmup match on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m going to apologize to the fans,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re about. And, yeah, we need to bounce back in a big way.\u201d It was the Americans\u2019 first four-goal loss since a 4-0 defeat in a 2016 World Cup qualifier at Costa Rica that caused US Soccer to fire coach J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann. It\u2019s the first time since 2009 the USMNT have conceded five goals in a single match on home soil. \u201cFrom the 75th minute on, it was I think a lack of respect for our opponent [and] the game of soccer, what we were doing,\u201d coach Gregg Berhalter said postgame. \u201cWe\u2019re not framing it a lesson learned, we\u2019ll frame it as a wake-up call.\u201d Jhon Arias put Colombia ahead in the sixth minute after the ball deflected to him when Robinson tried a sliding clearance without checking who was near. Rafael Santos Borr\u00e9 doubled the lead with a spectacular overhead kick in the 19th. The US had not given up two goals in the first 20 minutes since a March 2016 World Cup qualifier. Weah cut the deficit to 2-1 in the 58th, but Cardoso\u2019s turnover led to Richard R\u00edos\u2019 goal in the 77th, Weah\u2019s giveaway to Jorge Carrascal\u2019s in the 85th and Carter-Vickers\u2019 pass that didn\u2019t appear aimed at anyone to Luis Sinisterra\u2019s in the 88th. \u201cThere were some positive chunks of the game,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cBut, again, what I\u2019m looking at right now, 5-1? It\u2019s not good enough, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Colombia extended their unbeaten streak to 22 and their winning streak to seven. The USMNT still waiting to beat a top-25 side in the Fifa rankings outside Concacaf since Berhalter took change in 2019. \u201cEverybody could look in the mirror after that game or needs to look in the mirror after that game and figure it out,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThey just had a different intensity about them that we didn\u2019t have.\u201d The USMNT have six losses and two draws against the Colombians since 2005 and are winless in five games against South American opponents since 2019. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s a learning experience for all the boys,\u201d Weah said. Colombia will play Bolivia in an exhibition match in Denver on 15 June, then will enter the Copa group stages against Paraguay, Costa Rica and Brazil. The US and Colombia could meet in the quarter-finals. Before a pro-Colombian crowd clad in yellow jerseys at Commanders Field, American players wore rainbow numbers on their jerseys for Pride Month. For the first time in American history, all 11 starters played for clubs in England, Germany, Italy, Spain and France. Just six of 143 starting positions have been filled with Major League Soccer players for the 13 matches the full pool has been available since the 2022 World Cup, including three of 99 since Gregg Berhalter returned as coach. Colombia went ahead in the sixth minute when James Rodr\u00edguez threaded a pass that went off the left leg of a sliding Robinson to Arias. He took a touch to get clear of Tim Ream and from six yards beat Turner over the goalkeeper\u2019s left shoulder to the near post. Colombia doubled their lead in the 19th after Rodr\u00edguez played a short corner kick to Arias, who crossed. Tom Ream headed the ball in a clearance attempt, and Mateus Uribe headed the ball back in front. With his back to the goal from 5 yards out, Santos Borr\u00e9 leaned back as he jumped and with his right foot made an overhead kick that sent the ball in on a hop to Turner\u2019s left. The US will face Brazil in a friendly on Wednesday in Orlando in what will be their final warm-up game before the Copa Am\u00e9rica. \u201cThere\u2019s some glaring things that you have to address if you\u2019re going to compete at this level,\u201d Berhalter said. \u201cGuys just didn\u2019t do their job. It\u2019s about your role, your responsibility and we didn\u2019t do that.\u201d", "summary": "<ul><li>Colombia score three times in an 11-minute span</li><li>US open Copa Am\u00e9rica campaign on 23 June</li></ul><p>Matt Turner kept falling to the field, the American goalkeeper punching the ground in frustration.<br><br>\n A defensive lapse by Antonee Robinson and aimless defensive play by Johnny Cardoso, Tim Weah and Cameron Carter-Vickers led to four goals in an embarrassing 5-1 defeat to Colombia in a Copa Am\u00e9rica warmup match on Saturday.<br><br>\n \u201cI\u2019m going to apologize to the fans,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we\u2019re about.

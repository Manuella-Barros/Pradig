But the NCDMB under my leadership will not do a thing like that.\"\n\nHon. Boma Goodhead, during the hearing of the Committee with representatives of the NCDMB board, wondered how a company registered in 2020, not up to one year after its incorporation, was awarded a contract worth $35 million.\n\n\"The company was registered as a family company and has one naira per share capital of 10 million naira. How can the board pay 14 billion naira, by 40 percent to such a company? That simply means the company has just cash out on us.

Sun Nigeria", "body": "A former member of the House of Representatives, Hon Israel Sunny- Goli has petitioned the Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to probe multi-million-naira investments done by the Nigerian Content Development Monitoring Board (NCDMB).\n\nSunny- Goli, who represented Nembe/ Brass Federal Constituency in the 9th Assembly in a letter to the Executive Chairman of the EFCC, said he is calling for a ''thorough investigation and possible prosecution as it relates to the disbursement of funds for the Brass Fertilizer and Petrochemical Limited, the Atlantic International Refinery and Petrochemical Limited as well as the Brass Petroleum Product Terminal Limited''\n\nThe former lawmaker who said all the projects are situated within the precinct of Brass Local Government Area of Bayelsa State noted that the investments were undertaken during the tenure of the immediate past Executive Secretary of the Board, Engr Simbi Kesiye Wabote.\n\nAccording to him, NCDMB had a total equity contribution of $200million in the Brass Fertilizer and Petrochemical project which was conceived to establish two trains of 5,000MTPD methanol plants and one train of 500Mscf per day processing plant and associated infrastructure to be sited in Odioma, Brass Island Bayelsa State.\n\nFor the Atlantic Refinery project, he disclosed that full investment of $35million was made for the project which was expected to be a 2,000 bdp modular refinery with a jetty facility and a 2MW power plant and a duration of 24 months completion at the Brass Free Trade zone (FTZ).\n\nSunny- Goli stated further in his petition that also included for probe is the Brass Petroleum Product Terminal Limited which NCDMB's investment was for the establishment of a 50 million-litre facility with a two-way product jetty, automated storage tanks and loading bay in Brass Local Government Area of Bayelsa State.\n\nHe expressed sadness that the current state of the three projects is nothing to write home about as it is now surrounded by uncertainty and a sense of gloom.\n\nSunny-Goli pointed out that the projects are well-meaning and could provide jobs for the teeming unemployed youths and also increase the revenue of the government.\n\n\"To ensure that our great nation is not shortchanged, and our teeming unemployed youths denied gainful employment opportunities in line with the Renewed Hope Agenda of President Ahmed Bola Tinubu, I hereby request that your commission immediately institute a thorough investigation into the projects listed above and prosecute without delay anyone found culpable in the event of misappropriation of funds\" he said.\n\nThe former Executive Secretary of the Board, Simbi Wabote had recently waved off all allegations of wrong-doing noting that in August 2023 he had led NCDMB management to the two Ministers of State Petroleum where a presentation of more than 250 slides was made to provide information on all the Board projects, partnership, intervention funds, forensic audits, HCD programs, TSA account balance.\n\nA source in NCDMB said there is nothing strange in EFCC probing the investments, noting that a thorough investigation will exonerate the Board of any wrongdoing.", "source": {"uri": "sunnewsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Boma Goodhead expressed bewilderment at how a company established in 2020, barely a year old, could secure a $35 million contract.\n\nHe said, \"There is also the Brass Fertiliser, NCDMB also released a $20m, empty field. So, NCDMB has made some very bad investments. In this case, NCDMB has disbursed about $19Om in different equity investments, and none of them, apart from the Waltersmith modular refinery, can you say is worth a good investment.

Boma Goodhead expressed astonishment at how a company established in 2020, barely a year after its inception, could secure a $35 million contract.\n\n\"The company was registered as a family company and has one naira per share capital of 10 million naira. How can the board pay 14 billion naira, by 40 percent to such a company? That simply means the company has just cash out on us.

The company was registered as a family company and has one naira per share capital of 10 million naira.\n\n\"How can the board pay 14 billion naira, by 40 percent to such a company? That simply means the company has just cashed out on us. Taxpayers' money is used anyhow, if it were to be your own money would you go into such investments? How will you retrieve such money without equity?\n\n\"She continued\"Monies were just disbursed without due diligence, if you are claiming those funds are backed by CBN guarantee, why haven't you recovered them after the contract had expired?\n\n\"The tenure for loan domiciled with Bank Of Industries is 5 years, with the first set in 2018/2019. We have a document of 160 million out of 320 million dollars which means 50 per cent disbursement by the board, and you mentioned that you were proud of the business between the board and the bank, when recovery after expiry tenure is just 45 million dollars, resulting to a 30 per cent bad business loan\" She asked Isaac Yalah, the former Director of Finance & Personnel.\n\nResponding to Yalah who also doubled as Chairman of the Investment Review Committee, noted that all contracts were approved and monies disbursed by the council adding that all the processes required for disbursement were followed.\n\nOn the issue of awarding a contract worth $35 million to a company valued at 10 million naira, and yet the project was abandoned, Yalah said the project was delayed due to the challenges encountered by the post-COVID era which changed the dynamics of the projects and affected a lot of things.\n\nHe appealed to the committee that all necessary documents to back their transactions would be provided, adding that some contracts' tenure was also extended due to COVID.\n\nRecall that Atlantic International Refineries & Petrochemicals Limited is supposed to be situated in Okpoama-Brass local government area of Bayelsa State which is a Free Trade Zone area, which ordinarily would have given it a competitive advantage to seamlessly export finished petroleum products.", "source": {"uri": "newtelegraphng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "new_telegraph@newtelegraphng.com", "name": "New Telegraph", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boma_Goodhead", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boma Goodhead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_naira", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian naira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrochemical", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Petrochemical"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Independent States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayelsa_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayelsa State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bayelsa State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bank_of_Nigeria", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Bank of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due diligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recall election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_areas_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government areas of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free trade"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://newtelegraphng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NCDMB1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554417", "eventUri": "eng-9554417", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

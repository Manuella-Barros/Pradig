Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said at a press conference Wednesday on Capitol Hill. \"There is no reason why members of Congress ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get.\"\n\nThe proposal is the latest chapter in a years-long saga in Congress to pass regulations that limit lawmakers' ability to buy and sell stocks. And it will be the first of these to get formal consideration by a Senate committee -- in this case the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee on July 24.\n\nEthics experts say that members of Congress have access to so much information in the course of their work that is not available to the public, that they have an unfair investing advantage.\n\nWednesday's amendment to an existing stock trading ban bill would immediately forbid members of Congress, the president and the vice president from purchasing stocks and other covered investments. It would also give lawmakers 90 days to sell their stocks.\n\nSens. Hawley, Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Jeff Merkley, D-Or., and Gary Peters, D-Mi. negotiated and announced the new details.\n\nIf passed, the bill would also prohibit lawmakers' spouses and dependent children from trading stocks, beginning March 2027. Also starting that year, the U.S. president, vice president and all members of Congress would have to divest from any covered investments.\n\nThe penalty for violating the divestment mandate, as proposed by the senators, would cost a lawmaker the greater amount of either their monthly salary, or 10% of the value of each covered asset in violation.\n\nThe effort to bar members of Congress from trading stocks has been an uphill battle since at least the start of the Biden administration.\n\nSen. Ossoff first introduced a ban in 2021 and put his own stock portfolio in a blind trust as an example.\n\nThe effort was turbocharged by disclosures that several senators made very profitable trades in the earliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when members of Congress were getting classified briefings that warned of how disastrous the virus could be for the U.S. economy. The FBI launched insider trading investigations into three senators, but eventually ended them without criminal charges.\n\nThe effort picked up more steam ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, after former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dropped her opposition to it.\n\nPelosi's husband is a multimillionaire investor Paul Pelosi, who regularly makes large and profitable stock trades. The then-Speaker had previously written off the trading ban as a misguided effort to prevent lawmakers from participating in the \"free market economy.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_picciotto@nbcnewyork.com", "name": "Rebecca Picciotto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Merkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Merkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Ossoff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Ossoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insider trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blind trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/07/108003343-1720547654929-gettyimages-2161192878-_s2_9308_qnqn3mo6.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722232", "eventUri": "eng-9722232", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 654, "textEnd": 661}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Peters, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, is expected to take up the bill in his committee later this month.\n\nMerkley previewed the new proposal in an exclusive interview with NPR, saying, \"if you want to serve in Congress don't come here to serve your portfolio, come here to serve the people.\"\n\nHe argued the the issue cuts across party lines, \"The public is absolutely united in saying stock trading is wrong,\" Merkley said, pointing to a University of Maryland poll indicating 85% of the public backed banning trading by members of Congress.\n\nThere current law requires lawmakers to disclose when they trade individual stocks, but critics say it's unevenly enforced and insufficient. The STOCK (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge) Act, enacted in 2012, directs members of congress and their spouses to disclose any trades for transactions over $1,000 within 45 days.\n\nInsider trading laws apply to lawmakers, but the push more to require more transparency about their investments came after the 2009 financial crisis. Several lawmakers made large profits after trading financial services stocks before major banks began to fold. Those trades raised questions about whether they were profiting from information they learn on congressional committees.\n\n\"The fact that members of Congress do better than a generalized portfolio suggests that there's privileged information that folks hear about -- may not be inside information, maybe it's early information, maybe it's an insight that comes from working on a sector through your committee work or so on an so forth, But that is an issue,\" Merkley said.\n\nThe new bill, if passed, would direct lawmakers to stop buying any new individual stocks immediately and at the beginning of the next session of congress in 2027 lawmakers will be required to divest from any individual assets. Previous reform proposals directed lawmakers to shift assets into blind trusts, but this measure specifies mutual funds. Congressional staffers are not covered by the proposal.\n\n\"We've struggled for along time whether to include blind trusts, they're complicated and it's really simplification in this case. People will not be holding stocks and that's the cleanest, most pure form of this,\" Merkley said.\n\nSeveral House and Senate bipartisan efforts have been introduced in recent years, but none have made it far enough to be considered by committees. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- who doesn't trade stocks, but whose husband is an active trader -- initially opposed new reforms, but opened the door to passing legislation around the 2022 midterms. Several amendments to change the law have been pushed unsuccessfully in the Senate, but no panel has moved legislation to address concerns since the STOCK act passed.\n\nThe current law includes an enforcement mechanism that experts say is weak, with lawmakers facing a $200 fine for failing to report trades within the required deadline, which advocates say is the only way to track whether investments could be related to official duties. But members of both parties admit they have failed to file reports on time, and some file weeks or even more than a year late.\n\nThe Senate proposal would expand penalties. Under the plan, a failure to divest would result in fines of either the value of lawmaker's monthly salary or 10% of the values of each asset that's in violation of the law - whichever is greater.\n\n\"The fines are huge in this bill,\" Merkley said, stressing the penalties are assessed monthly, noting, \"a person who is in violation would run up huge impacts very, very quickly.\"\n\nUnder the new Senate proposal all lawmakers and new members elected would have to alter existing portfolios by March 31, 2027. They would be given 120 days to divest all covered investments. The proposal also includes a provision requiring a certificate of divestiture covering both the President and the vice president.\n\nIf lawmaker leaves public service there would be a 90 day \"cooling off\" period during which they would still be barred from investing in individual stocks.\n\nIt would also increase the penalty for non-reporting to $500 and require that all disclosures be in a searchable public database.\n\nThe disclosures that lawmakers currently file have prompted financial services companies to create products that model lawmakers' investments. Those funds have consistently beat the market -- a dynamic that non profit groups pushing for reforms demonstrate that the public doesn't trust their elected officials.\n\nMerkley acknowledged that it's unlikely the proposal would get a standalone vote, but he says he is aiming to get it attached to another must pass bill this year.\n\nHe admitted moving the issue has been difficult when pushing a law impacting lawmakers financial portfolios, saying \"members of Congress get very twitchy and when you say your family will be covered too, they have concerns.\"", "source": {"uri": "weku.org",

Peters, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs committee, is expected to take up the bill in his committee later this month.\n\nMerkley previewed the new proposal in an exclusive interview with NPR, saying, \"if you want to serve in Congress don't come here to serve your portfolio, come here to serve the people.\"\n\nHe argued the the issue cuts across party lines, \"The public is absolutely united in saying stock trading is wrong,\" Merkley said, pointing to a University of Maryland poll indicating 85% of the public backed banning trading by members of Congress.\n\nThere current law requires lawmakers to disclose when they trade individual stocks, but critics say it's unevenly enforced and insufficient. The STOCK (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge) Act, enacted in 2012, directs members of congress and their spouses to disclose any trades for transactions over $1,000 within 45 days.\n\nInsider trading laws apply to lawmakers, but the push more to require more transparency about their investments came after the 2009 financial crisis. Several lawmakers made large profits after trading financial services stocks before major banks began to fold. Those trades raised questions about whether they were profiting from information they learn on congressional committees.\n\n\"The fact that members of Congress do better than a generalized portfolio suggests that there's privileged information that folks hear about -- may not be inside information, maybe it's early information, maybe it's an insight that comes from working on a sector through your committee work or so on an so forth, But that is an issue,\" Merkley said.\n\nThe new bill, if passed, would direct lawmakers to stop buying any new individual stocks immediately and at the beginning of the next session of congress in 2027 lawmakers will be required to divest from any individual assets. Previous reform proposals directed lawmakers to shift assets into blind trusts, but this measure specifies mutual funds. Congressional staffers are not covered by the proposal.\n\n\"We've struggled for along time whether to include blind trusts, they're complicated and it's really simplification in this case. People will not be holding stocks and that's the cleanest, most pure form of this,\" Merkley said.\n\nSeveral House and Senate bipartisan efforts have been introduced in recent years, but none have made it far enough to be considered by committees. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- who doesn't trade stocks, but whose husband is an active trader -- initially opposed new reforms, but opened the door to passing legislation around the 2022 midterms. Several amendments to change the law have been pushed unsuccessfully in the Senate, but no panel has moved legislation to address concerns since the STOCK act passed.\n\nThe current law includes an enforcement mechanism that experts say is weak, with lawmakers facing a $200 fine for failing to report trades within the required deadline, which advocates say is the only way to track whether investments could be related to official duties. But members of both parties admit they have failed to file reports on time, and some file weeks or even more than a year late.\n\nThe Senate proposal would expand penalties. Under the plan, a failure to divest would result in fines of either the value of lawmaker's monthly salary or 10% of the values of each asset that's in violation of the law - whichever is greater.\n\n\"The fines are huge in this bill,\" Merkley said, stressing the penalties are assessed monthly, noting, \"a person who is in violation would run up huge impacts very, very quickly.\"\n\nUnder the new Senate proposal all lawmakers and new members elected would have to alter existing portfolios by March 31, 2027. They would be given 120 days to divest all covered investments. The proposal also includes a provision requiring a certificate of divestiture covering both the President and the vice president.\n\nIf lawmaker leaves public service there would be a 90 day \"cooling off\" period during which they would still be barred from investing in individual stocks.\n\nIt would also increase the penalty for non-reporting to $500 and require that all disclosures be in a searchable public database.\n\nThe disclosures that lawmakers currently file have prompted financial services companies to create products that model lawmakers' investments. Those funds have consistently beat the market -- a dynamic that non profit groups pushing for reforms demonstrate that the public doesn't trust their elected officials.\n\nMerkley acknowledged that it's unlikely the proposal would get a standalone vote, but he says he is aiming to get it attached to another must pass bill this year.\n\nHe admitted moving the issue has been difficult when pushing a law impacting lawmakers financial portfolios, saying \"members of Congress get very twitchy and when you say your family will be covered too, they have concerns.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org",

Ethics experts say their access to information that is not available to the public gives them an unfair investing advantage.\n\nA bipartisan group of senators on Wednesday launched a renewed effort to ban members of Congress from trading stock.\n\n\"Congress should not be here to make a buck,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said at a press conference Wednesday on Capitol Hill. \"There is no reason why members of Congress ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get.\"\n\nThe proposal is the latest chapter in a years-long saga in Congress to pass regulations that limit lawmakers' ability to buy and sell stocks. And it will be the first of these to get formal consideration by a Senate committee -- in this case the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee on July 24.\n\nEthics experts say that members of Congress have access to so much information in the course of their work that is not available to the public, that they have an unfair investing advantage.\n\nWednesday's amendment to an existing stock trading ban bill would immediately forbid members of Congress, the president and the vice president from purchasing stocks and other covered investments. It would also give lawmakers 90 days to sell their stocks.\n\nSens. Hawley, Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Jeff Merkley, D-Or., and Gary Peters, D-Mi. negotiated and announced the new details.\n\nIf passed, the bill would also prohibit lawmakers' spouses and dependent children from trading stocks, beginning March 2027. Also starting that year, the U.S. president, vice president and all members of Congress would have to divest from any covered investments.\n\nThe penalty for violating the divestment mandate, as proposed by the senators, would cost a lawmaker the greater amount of either their monthly salary, or 10% of the value of each covered asset in violation.\n\nThe effort to bar members of Congress from trading stocks has been an uphill battle since at least the start of the Biden administration.\n\nSen. Ossoff first introduced a ban in 2021 and put his own stock portfolio in a blind trust as an example.\n\nThe effort was turbocharged by disclosures that several senators made very profitable trades in the earliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when members of Congress were getting classified briefings that warned of how disastrous the virus could be for the U.S. economy. The FBI launched insider trading investigations into three senators, but eventually ended them without criminal charges.\n\nThe effort picked up more steam ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, after former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dropped her opposition to it.\n\nPelosi's husband is a multimillionaire investor Paul Pelosi, who regularly makes large and profitable stock trades. The then-Speaker had previously written off the trading ban as a misguided effort to prevent lawmakers from participating in the \"free market economy.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Hawley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Josh Hawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Homeland_Security_and_Governmental_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Merkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Merkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Homeland_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Homeland Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Ossoff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Ossoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insider trading"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blind trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/07/108003343-1720547654929-gettyimages-2161192878-_s2_9308_qnqn3mo6.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722232", "eventUri": "eng-9722232", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 890, "textEnd": 897}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Gary Peters, D-Mich., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Jon Ossoff, D-Ga.\n\n\"Americans deserve to have confidence that their federal elected officials are making decisions that are in the best interest of the American public and not in the interest of any personal finances,\" Peters, the Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee chair, said Wednesday at a press conference in Washington, adding that the Senate panel would take the \"historic step\" to consider the bill on July 24.\n\nThis will be the first time Congress has formally considered such legislation.\n\nUnder the bill's framework, members of Congress would be \"immediately\" banned from trading stocks if it becomes law, according to Merkley. The legislation if passed beginning March 2027 would then prohibit lawmakers' spouses and dependent children from trading stocks as well.\n\nAlso starting that year, the U.S. president, vice president and all members of Congress would have to divest from any \"covered investments.\"\n\nBut Hawley says he is not sure now if enough members will support the measure to get it passed.\n\n\"Congress should not be here to make a buck,\" the Missouri Republican said Wednesday on Capitol Hill. \"There is no reason why members of Congress ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get.\"\n\nExperts say the privileged information given to members of Congress in both the House and Senate chambers provides an unfair advantage in investing not afforded to a typical American.\n\nOssoff in 2022 joined Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., introducing a similar bill to prohibit congress members from trading stocks while in office, a move that was followed when Hawley introduced a similar bill of his own.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., whose own husband Paul Pelosi is a wealthy investor who often makes trades, only last year began to soften in her opposition to such legislation, dismissing such ideas to prevent lawmakers from participating in the \"free market economy.\"\n\nBut Pelosi's switch on the issue was only after she got a letter singed by 27 House members -- two Republicans and 25 Democrats -- urging members of Congress be banned from trading or owning stocks. That letter also was addressed to then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nIn September last year, former Rep. Stephen Buyer, R-Ind., was sentenced to nearly 2 years behind bars after being convicted of four counts of securities fraud stemming from two insider trading schemes allegedly created with non-public information. However, the alleged crimes took place after Buyer had left Congress in 2011.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama signed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, known as the STOCK Act, on April 4, 2012, a law that only then officially banned insider trading by members of Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, it took until 2022 for the Federal Reserve to enact rules banning or restricting certain investment and trading activities by Fed officials, designed to \"support public confidence in the impartiality and integrity of the Committee's work by guarding against even the appearance of any conflict of interest.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Peters", "type":

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., speaks at a press conference announcing a Senate bill to ban congress members from trading stock\n\nSens. Gary Peters, D-Mich., Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announced the legislation dubbed the Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks (ETHICS) Act.\n\nIf passed it would ban trading for members 90 days after being signed into law.\n\nRestricted trading for spouses and and dependents would kick in later in March 2027.\n\nNotably, many of the expensive disclosers from notable congressional traders like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., are done under the names of spouses, like Paul Pelosi - who also happens to be a venture capitalist.\n\nThe penalties for violating the law would be 10 percent of the value of the asset bought or sold.\n\n'Democrats, Independents, Republicans, overwhelmingly agree that members of Congress should not be playing the stock market,' Ossoff said at an event announcing the legislation.\n\nRead MoreEXCLUSIVE Inside Nancy Pelosi's estimated $250 million fortune and other stock-trading politician's portfolios\n\n'This is long overdue,' he said. 'This is necessary.'\n\nOssoff mentioned how it was a campaign pledge of his to outlaw trading for members, saying, 'That's why I've been pleased to engage in this long and productive bipartisan effort to craft a path forward.'\n\nThe Republican behind the bill Josh Hawley said, 'There is no reason that Congress ought to be profiting off of information that only they get.'\n\n'No loopholes. No blind trusts. Let's get this done,' the senator posted on X after the event.\n\nChairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Gary Peters, will address the bill in a markup on July 24.\n\n'We're going to be taking what I believe is a historic step forward on legislation that will ban members of Congress from trading stocks,' Peters said in the Senate TV Gallery.\n\n'Senators, Merkley, Hawley, Ossoff and I have come to a bipartisan agreement on legislation.'\n\nMerkley said of the bill: 'We must be here to serve the public, not our portfolios.'\n\nThe lone Republican behind the bill Josh Hawley said, 'There is no reason that Congress ought to be profiting off of information that only they get'\n\n'Democrats , Independents, Republicans, overwhelmingly agree that members of Congress should not be playing the stock market,' Sen. Ossoff said at the event.\n\nAlso on Wednesday 20 lawmakers called on House leadership to get started on a stock trading ban in the lower chamber of Congress\n\nNearly simultaneously, an even larger group of House lawmakers announced they had sent a letter to that chamber's leadership demanding action on a stock trading ban for members.\n\n'We are writing to respectfully urge you to hold a vote on legislation to prohibit members of Congress from owning or trading stocks,' said a letter signed by 20 members addressed to Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.\n\n'As we head into the last few months of the 118th Congress, we believe that taking action on this common-sense, bipartisan legislation will ensure that members of Congress are serving the country and their constituents, not their bank accounts,' it continues.\n\nIn total 16 House Democrats and four Republicans signed the letter.\n\nOut of the 20 lawmakers who signed the bill, disclosures indicate only two of them have ever traded stock while in office: Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts and Sharice Davids of Kansas.\n\nNancy Pelosi's November 2023 financial disclosures reveal a significant purchase of Nvidia. That trade has seen over a 178 percent increase in value since\n\n'It's been nearly two years since House leadership committed to holding a vote on a bill to reform stock trading practices for Members of Congress.'\n\n'In a hyper-partisan political environment where American approval ratings of Congress are at an all-time low, this is a common-sense and bipartisan change, making it crystal clear that we come to Washington to serve our constituents, not to serve our own financial interests,' the letter said.\n\nCongressional stock trades have caught the public eye since the pandemic, when some lawmakers raised eyebrows by selling shortly after closed-door COVID-19 briefings before the stock market crashed.\n\nPelosi, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., Rep. Dan Mueser, D-Pa., Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., for example, have all traded over a million dollars in securities this year, according to federal data compiled by politician trade tracker Quiver Quantitative.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Quiver, Pelosi's net worth has doubled in the past decade from $123 million in 2014 to nearly $250 million in 2024\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., the data firm estimates, is worth a cool $47.2 million\n\nGottheimer has reported trading over $277 million worth of securities since 2017\n\nIn 2012, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act was passed to force politicians to disclose their trades.\n\nThe act forces officials to publicly disclose their transactions valued over $1,000 within 30 days of receiving notice of the trade and 45 days of the date of the trade. However, it does not require members disclose the exact price of a trade but rather a range.\n\nStill, disclosures reveal that Congress traded over $1 billion in 2023 and certain savvy politicians raked in returns earning over 200 percent on some trades.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said at a press conference Wednesday on Capitol Hill. \"There is no reason why members of Congress ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get.\"\n\nThe proposal is the latest chapter in a years-long saga in Congress to pass regulations that limit lawmakers' ability to buy and sell stocks. And it will be the first of these to get formal consideration by a Senate committee -- in this case the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee on July 24.\n\nEthics experts say that members of Congress have access to so much information in the course of their work that is not available to the public, that they have an unfair investing advantage.\n\nWednesday's amendment to an existing stock trading ban bill would immediately forbid members of Congress, the president and the vice president from purchasing stocks and other covered investments. It would also give lawmakers 90 days to sell their stocks.\n\nSens. Hawley, Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Jeff Merkley, D-Or., and Gary Peters, D-Mi. negotiated and announced the new details.\n\nIf passed, the bill would also prohibit lawmakers' spouses and dependent children from trading stocks, beginning March 2027. Also starting that year, the U.S. president, vice president and all members of Congress would have to divest from any covered investments.\n\nThe penalty for violating the divestment mandate, as proposed by the senators, would cost a lawmaker the greater amount of either their monthly salary, or 10% of the value of each covered asset in violation.\n\nThe effort to bar members of Congress from trading stocks has been an uphill battle since at least the start of the Biden administration.\n\nSen. Ossoff first introduced a ban in 2021 and put his own stock portfolio in a blind trust as an example.\n\nThe effort was turbocharged by disclosures that several senators made very profitable trades in the earliest days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when members of Congress were getting classified briefings that warned of how disastrous the virus could be for the U.S. economy. The FBI launched insider trading investigations into three senators, but eventually ended them without criminal charges.\n\nThe effort picked up more steam ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, after former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi dropped her opposition to it.\n\nPelosi's husband is a multimillionaire investor Paul Pelosi, who regularly makes large and profitable stock trades. The then-Speaker had previously written off the trading ban as a misguided effort to prevent lawmakers from participating in the \"free market economy.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType":

passed, would ban sitting members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children, and the sitting President and Vice President from trading stocks.\n\nMembers of Congress have faced scrutiny for their individual stock trades since the 2009 financial crisis, but that scrutiny has increased considerably over the past few years, especially as some members have made timely, profitable trades.\n\nThere's even a growing movement for investors to follow the trades of sitting members of Congress via ETFs that track their trades.\n\nThe concerns over members of Congress and their spouses trading stocks are mainly based on the material information that they might be privy to that the rest of the public is not.\n\nRepublican Senator Josh Hawley and Democratic Senators Jon Ossoff, Jeff Merkley, and Gary Peters introduced the bill.\n\n\"There is no reason why members of Congress ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get,\" Hawley said at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe legislation, dubbed the ETHICS act, or Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks, is a milestone in that it will be the first stock trading bills to get formal consideration by the Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee later this month.\n\nHouse of Representative members Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Matt Gaetz worked together in 2023 to introduce a stock trading ban, but the bill didn't get far.\n\nThe ETHICS legislation, if passed, would immediately ban members of Congress from trading stocks, and it would come with an imposed timeline to divest their stocks when the next session of Congress starts in 2027.\n\n\"If you want to serve in Congress don't come here to serve your portfolio, come here to serve the people,\" Senator Merkley told NPR.\n\nThe proposed law would also impose hefty fines on Congressional members who violated the trading ban.\n\n\"The fines are huge in this bill,\" Merkley said. \"A person who is in violation would run up huge impacts very, very quickly.\"\n\nThe current fine for members of Congress who fail to disclose their stock trades in a timely manner is $200, based on the STOCK Act that was passed in 2012.\n\nThe proposed ETHICS Act would levy a fine that is the greater amount of either their monthly salary or 10% of the value for each asset that is in violation of the law.\n\nBut the passage of this new stock trading ban faces an uphill battle from Congress itself.\n\n\"Members of Congress get very twitchy and when you say your family will be covered too, they have concerns,\" Merkley said.\n\nMerkley said that while the ETHICS Act was unlikely to receive a standalone vote for passage, he is aiming to attach it to another high-priority bill this year in the form of an amendment.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri":

banning members from trading stocks", "body": "Congress is once again attempting to ban its members from trading individual stocks.\n\nA bipartisan group of Senators unveiled a new bill on Wednesday that, if passed, would ban sitting members of Congress, their spouses and dependent children, and the sitting President and Vice President from trading stocks.\n\nMembers of Congress have faced scrutiny for their individual stock trades since the 2009 financial crisis, but that scrutiny has increased considerably over the past few years, especially as some members have made timely, profitable trades.\n\nThere's even a growing movement for investors to follow the trades of sitting members of Congress via ETFs that track their trades.\n\nThe concerns over members of Congress and their spouses trading stocks are mainly based on the material information that they might be privy to that the rest of the public is not.\n\nRepublican Senator Josh Hawley and Democratic Senators Jon Ossoff, Jeff Merkley, and Gary Peters introduced the bill.\n\n\"There is no reason why members of Congress ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get,\" Hawley said at a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nThe legislation, dubbed the ETHICS act, or Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks, is a milestone in that it will be the first stock trading bills to get formal consideration by the Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee later this month.\n\nHouse of Representative members Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Matt Gaetz worked together in 2023 to introduce a stock trading ban, but the bill didn't get far.\n\nThe ETHICS legislation, if passed, would immediately ban members of Congress from trading stocks, and it would come with an imposed timeline to divest their stocks when the next session of Congress starts in 2027.\n\n\"If you want to serve in Congress don't come here to serve your portfolio, come here to serve the people,\" Senator Merkley told NPR.\n\nThe proposed law would also impose hefty fines on Congressional members who violated the trading ban.\n\n\"The fines are huge in this bill,\" Merkley said. \"A person who is in violation would run up huge impacts very, very quickly.\"\n\nThe current fine for members of Congress who fail to disclose their stock trades in a timely manner is $200, based on the STOCK Act that was passed in 2012.\n\nThe proposed ETHICS Act would levy a fine that is the greater amount of either their monthly salary or 10% of the value for each asset that is in violation of the law.\n\nBut the passage of this new stock trading ban faces an uphill battle from Congress itself.\n\n\"Members of Congress get very twitchy and when you say your family will be covered too, they have concerns,\" Merkley said.\n\nMerkley said that while the ETHICS Act was unlikely to receive a standalone vote for passage, he is aiming to attach it to another high-priority bill this year in the form of an amendment.", "source": {"uri": "markets.businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Markets Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_fox@markets.businessinsider.com", "name": "Matthew

Gary Peters of Michigan, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, on Wednesday to announce a compromise bill that would ban lawmakers from trading stocks. It will be introduced later this month in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nThe four senators came together to write the bipartisan legislation after each had his own separate proposal. There is no guarantee that it will be brought to the floor for a vote, but its slated July 27 markup is a major step toward that possibility - and the first time a bill banning stock trades by lawmakers would be taken up by a committee in the upper chamber.\n\nUS NATIONAL DEBT TO SURGE TO RECORD LEVELS WITHOUT REFORM, RAISING PROSPECT OF DEBT CRISIS\n\nThe bill, which is a modification of Merkley's Ethics Act, would immediately ban members of Congress from buying stocks and other covered investments and prohibit members from selling stocks within 90 days of enactment.\n\nIf signed into law, the legislation would also ban the spouses and dependent children of lawmakers from trading stocks starting in March 2027. It would also require members of Congress, the president and vice president to divest from all covered investments, starting the same year.\n\nPenalties for violations of the divestment requirements of the bill would be either the monthly salary of the official or 10% of the value of each asset in violation, whichever is the greater amount. The bill also raises Stock Act penalties for non-reporting from $200 to $500.\n\nSEN.

And no member should be thinking about their personal gain when voting on bills or writing legislation,\" Merkley said.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nHe added, \"In a huge step forward, this bill will be marked up and receive bipartisan support in committee.

Gary Peters announced Wednesday.\n\nPeters, who heads the Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, is leading the effort along with a bipartisan group of senators.\n\n\"I believe that Americans deserve to have confidence that their federal elected officials are making decisions that are in the best interest of the American public, and are not in the interest of any personal finances or financial decisions they make,\" Peters, D-Bloomfield Township, said Wednesday.\n\nThe bill would ban lawmakers -- including the president and vice president of the United States -- from buying and selling a wide range of financial assets. They include securities, commodities, futures, options, trusts and \"other comparable holdings,\" according to Peters.\n\nHe added that the legislation would also require that federal elected officials, their spouses and dependent children divest from any such assets beginning in 2027.\n\nMany members of Michigan's congressional delegation have expressed support for similar bans in recent years, especially in the wake of profitable trades by lawmakers from both parties after they were briefed in 2020 about the dawning coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLook back: Why some Michigan lawmakers back banning Congressional members from trading stocks (2022)\n\nBefore then, a Dartmouth University study found that neither Democratic nor Republican lawmakers in Congress were particularly adept at picking stock, at least during their analysis period beginning in 2012 and ending in March 2020. But the pandemic drew new outcry.\n\nThe bipartisan group behind the current effort includes U.S. Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Missouri), Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) and Jon Ossoff (D-Georgia).\n\n\"We must be there to serve the public and not our portfolios,\" Merkley said during a press conference. He noted that he's been working to ban stock trading among his congressional peers since 2012, when he led a similar effort that ultimately failed.\n\n\"Even more importantly,\" Merkley added, \"is the conflict of interest. The idea that you own a portfolio that concentrates in fossil fuels, or renewable energy, or bank stocks or pharmaceuticals and you are writing legislation, preparing amendments or voting on bills that affect those investments.\"\n\nMerkley also cited a poll from the University of Maryland showing that 86% of Americans -- with similar numbers among Democrats and Republicans -- support a ban on stock trading for members of Congress.\n\nHawley praised Peters for bringing forth a reform measure that \"will be tough, that will close the loopholes, that will close the avenues of avoidance, that will impose real penalties.\"\n\n\"It's really simple and you don't need to explain it to anybody in America,\" Hawley said. \"The only people you have to explain it to are here in this building.\"\n\nPeters said his committee will consider the legislation during its next markup session, currently scheduled for July 24.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news",

The press conference included Democratic Senators Gary Peters of Michigan, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Jon Ossoff of Georgia as well as Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley.\n\nCongressional stock trading and accusations of insider trading have been at the forefront of discussions regarding corruption in Congress. Some internet accounts have even found fame by copying the trades of different members of Congress. (RELATED: Appeals Court Greenlights Campaign Finance Case Against Nonprofit Founded By Stacey Abrams)\n\nUnusual Whales, a site dedicated to tracking market activity, has an entire section of its website dedicated to tracking congressional trades. The returns that members have experienced are exponentially higher than even the best of Wall Street, with four generating returns in excess of 100% in 2023.\n\nPerhaps the most notable Congressional lawmaker to catch flak for her stock trades is California Democrat Nancy Pelosi. Business outlets have covered the trades of Pelosi and her husband for years, and her returns have been gargantuan. Increased attention on Pelosi's activity helped gin up public support for new restrictions on Congress.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, then-Republican Sen. Richard Burr faced an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for potential insider trading violations, although the agency later dropped its probe.\n\n\"This is long overdue, this is necessary and this is a major step forward,\" Ossoff noted in his statement at the conference. Ossoff also mentioned the overwhelming public support for such measures among members of both parties and independents.\n\nSen. Hawley, the only Republican in the group, emphasized the idea that members of Congress are in Washington to serve the American people, not to be \"day trading\" or \"making a buck.\"\n\nThe legislation will be submitted to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs July 24th, according to Sen. Peters who serves as its chair. It will be the first time that a committee considers legislation to ban members of Congress from banning stocks.", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily

Josh Hawley, R-Mo., Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and John Fetterman, D-Pa., headline the group of senators sponsoring the measure. Sen. Hawley said during a press conference the proposal has broad support from Americans.\n\nThe truth is Congress should not be here to make a buck,\" he said. \"There is no reason why members of Congress ought to be profiting off of the information that only they get that the rest of the American people don't get.\"\n\n\"Why should members of Congress be spending their time day trading rather than focusing on the priorities that the American people sent us here to achieve and focus on?\" he asked.\n\nSen. Hawley has been extremely critical of stock market transactions by members of government. In April, grilled Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm over what he said was her failure to report certain stock market transactions in violation of the STOCK Act.

It would further prohibit congressional spouses and other members of their immediate family from purchasing stocks as of March 2027.\n\nViolations of the law would result in a fine of either a month's salary or 10% of each asset's value, whichever is greater.\n\nAccording to a University of Maryland poll, fully 85% of Americans want to ban stock trades for members of Congress. Between the countrywide consensus regarding the issue and the bipartisan nature of the legislation, supporters of the ETHICS Act are hopeful that it may in fact pass, despite the contentious election season and the failure of similar legislative efforts in the past.\n\nThe Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is already scheduled to begin considering the bill on July 24.\n\nMeanwhile, members of Blaze Media are already celebrating the bill as a major victory following the release of \"Bought and Paid For\" in April. James Poulos, host of \"Bought and Paid For\" as well as the editor at large of Blaze Media and the editorial director of its RETURN division, is particularly encouraged by this turn of events.\n\n\"Members of Congress can get rich on stock trades thanks to their special access to information ordinary Americans don't have -- and many do just that, because wrongdoing is so hard to prove in court and current congressional rules are so lax,\" he told Blaze News.\n\n\"Americans across party lines agree this practice should be brought to an end, and cracking down boasts bipartisan support on the Hill. It's heartening to see a new group of senators take a fresh swing at a solution that's long overdue.\"\n\nThe trailer for \"Bought and Paid For\" can be seen below.

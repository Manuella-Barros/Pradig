The BJP has fielded a Thakur candidate against him and is expected to retain the community's vote on the seat.\n\nThe Pal community comes in the Most Backward Castes (MBC) in the Other Backward Classes (OBC), and is one of the 17 MBCs that have been seeking Scheduled Caste status. It is the MBCs that have stood by the BJP in the last two elections and have made the difference in close contests.\n\nWith the move, party president Akhilesh Yadav seems to reiterate his message that the party is not only promoting non-Yadav OBCs but is also embracing the MBCs in its 'Pichda (backward), Dalit, Adivasi' (PDA) family. The move could impact the seats going for polls in the fourth and fifth phases. \"The party has already fielded six Nishad and Bind candidates who are also part of the 17 MBCs seeking SC status. If the Kurmis, Kushwahas (seven candidates), and Nishads get even 30% of their community's vote, they will sail through,\" a senior party leader said.\n\nDuring his tenure as the Chief Minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav had tried to rejig the quota but the move was rejected by the Centre. In 2019, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath also attempted but again it didn't get the Central government's approval. Now the SP, in its slogan of saving the reservation, is addressing the unfinished business of caste groups that feel they didn't get their due share.\n\nA source in Firozabad said a delegation of the

Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas hailed the decision while Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said it cannot alter the \"legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland\".\n\nThe top UN court said Friday that Israel's presence in the Palestinian Territories is \"unlawful\" and called on it to end and for settlement construction to stop immediately, issuing an unprecedented, sweeping condemnation of Israel's rule over the lands it captured 57 years ago.\n\nIn a non-binding opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) pointed to a wide list of policies, including the building and expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, use of the area's natural resources, the annexation and imposition of permanent control over lands and discriminatory policies against Palestinians, all of which it said violated international law.\n\nThe 15-judge panel said Israel's \"abuse of its status as the occupying power\" renders its \"presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful.\" It says its continued presence was \"illegal\" and should be ended as \"rapidly as possible\".\n\nIt said Israel must end settlement construction immediately and that existing settlements must be removed, according to the 83-page opinion read out by court President Nawaf Salam.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has been stagnant for more than a decade.\n\nThe office of Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas welcomed a \"historic\" decision by the ICJ.\n\n\"The presidency welcomes the decision of the International Court of Justice, considers it a historic decision and demands that Israel be compelled to implement it,\" it said in a statement on its official news agency shortly after the ruling was made public.\n\nIn response to the ruling, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said the West Bank and East Jerusalem were part of the Jewish people's historical \"homeland\".\n\n\"The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land - not in our eternal capital Jerusalem and not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" he said in a post on X. \"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\"\n\nThe court's opinion, sought by the UN General Assembly after a Palestinian request, is unlikely to affect Israel's policy. But its resounding breadth - including saying Israel could not claim sovereignty in the territories and was impeding Palestinians' right to self-determination - could impact international opinion.\n\nIt came against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led October 7 attacks in southern Israel. In a separate case, the ICJ is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed East Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized. It withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power there in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Authority foreign minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 nations and three international organisations.\n\nRuling 'worsens the case for occupation'\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that a court ruling that Israel's policies in the West Bank and East Jerusalem breach international law would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view\".\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" - such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it could also increase the number of countries that recognise the state of Palestine, particularly in the West, following the recent examples of Spain, Norway and Ireland.\n\nSecurity measure vs land grab\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law\". Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15 percent in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed East Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in East Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighbuorhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nNetanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalise outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometres (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com",

It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N.

Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nThe top United Nations court said Israel's settlement policy in the West Bank and east Jerusalem violates international law, as it delivered a non-binding advisory opinion on the legality of Israel's 57-year occupation of lands sought for a Palestinian state, a ruling that could have more effect on international opinion than it will on Israeli policies.\n\nInternational Court of Justice President Nawaf Salam was expected to take about an hour to read out the full opinion of the panel, which is made up of 15 judges from around the world.\n\nIn part of the opinion, he said the panel had found that \"the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as Israel's maintenance of their presence, is contrary to article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\" The court also noted with \"grave concern\" that Israel's settlement policy has been expanding.\n\nThe court also found that Israel's use of natural resources was \"inconsistent\" with its obligations under international law as an occupying power.\n\nFriday's hearing comes against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings.

The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognised, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognise Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens\", address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders\".\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organisations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view\".\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognise the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe UN General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15 per cent in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighbourhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalise outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.

It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nREAD MORE: Palestinian diplomat accuses Israel of apartheid, urges top UN court to declare occupation illegal\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org",

It said other nations were obliged not to \"render aid or assistance in maintaining\" Israel's presence in the territories. It said Israel must end settlement construction immediately and that existing settlements must be removed, according to a summary of the more than 80-page opinion read out by court President Nawaf Salam.\n\nIsrael's \"abuse of its status as the occupying power\" renders its \"presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful,\" the court said, saying its presence must be ended as \"rapidly as possible.\"\n\nThe court's opinion, sought by the U.N. General Assembly after a Palestinian request, came against the backdrop of Israel's devastating military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nThe court said the General Assembly and Security Council -- where staunch Israeli ally the United States holds a veto -- should consider \"the precise modalities\" to end Israel's presence in the territories.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, didn't send a legal team to the hearings. Instead, it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has been stagnant for more than a decade.\n\n\"The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land -- not in our eternal capital Jerusalem and not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office, using the biblical terms for the West Bank. \"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\"\n\nSpeaking outside the court, Riad Malki, an adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called the opinion \"a watershed moment for Palestine, for justice and for international law.\"\n\nHe said other nations must now \"uphold the clear obligations\" outlined by the court. \"No actions of any kind ... to support Israel's illegal occupation.\"\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved populations there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that isn't internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nThe court's decision strikes at the heart of the ambiguity of Israel's administration of the territories. Israel hasn't annexed the West Bank -- though settler groups have pressed it to do so -- but it calls it part of its homeland and has effectively treated it as an extension of the nation. Along with the settlements, it has appropriated large swaths of the territory as \"state lands.\" At the same time, Netanyahu's government has repeatedly rejected the creation of any Palestinian state. Abbas' Palestinian Authority has been restricted to control over divided enclaves scattered around the West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments at hearings in February, along with 49 other nations and three international organizations. In the hearings, Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said before the decision that a ruling that Israel's policies breach international law would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would remove \"any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\" It could also increase the number of countries that recognize a Palestinian state, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland, he said.\n\nIt's not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies.

It said Israel must end settlement construction immediately and that existing settlements must be removed, according to a summary of the more than 80-page opinion read out by court President Nawaf Salam.\n\nIsrael's \"abuse of its status as the occupying power\" renders its \"presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful,\" the court said, saying its presence must be ended as \"rapidly as possible\".\n\nThe court's opinion, sought by the UN General Assembly after a Palestinian request, decision came against the backdrop of Israel's devastating military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel on October 7. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, didn't send a legal team to the hearings. Instead, it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has been stagnant for more than a decade.\n\n\"The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land -- not in our eternal capital Jerusalem and not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office, using the biblical terms for the West Bank. \"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\"\n\nSpeaking outside the court, Riad Malki, an adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called the opinion \"a watershed moment for Palestine, for justice and for international law\".\n\nHe said other nations must now \"uphold the clear obligations\" outlined by the court. \"No actions of any kind ... to support Israel's illegal occupation\".\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved populations there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that isn't internationally recognised, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nThe court's decision strikes at the heart of the ambiguity of Israel's administration of the territories. Israel hasn't annexed the West Bank -- though settler groups have pressed it to do so -- but it calls it part of its homeland and has effectively treated it as an extension of the nation. Along with the settlements, it has appropriated large swaths of the territory as \"state lands\".\n\nAt the same time, Netanyahu's government has repeatedly rejected the creation of any Palestinian state. Abbas' Palestinian Authority has been restricted to control over divided enclaves scattered around the West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments at hearings in February, along with 49 other nations and three international organisations. In the hearings, Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said before the decision that a ruling that Israel's policies breach international law would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would remove \"any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\" It could also increase the number of countries that recognise a Palestinian state, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland, he said.\n\nIt's not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab, because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15 per cent in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nNetanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalise outposts.", "source": {"uri":

The International Court of Justice was issuing a non-binding opinion on the legality of Israel's 57-year occupation of lands sought for a Palestinian state, and the ruling is likely to have more effect on international opinion than it will on Israeli policies. The court's panel of 15 judges from around the world said Israel has abused its status as the occupying power in the West Bank and east Jerusalem by carrying out policies of annexing territory, imposing permanent control and building settlements. It said Israel must end settlement construction immediately. It said such acts render \"Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful.\"\u009d It says its continued presence was \"\u009dillegal\"\u009d and should be ended as \"rapidly as possible.\"\u009d Israel, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has stagnant for more than a decade. In the opinion read out by court President Nawaf Salam, the court found that \"the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as Israel's maintenance of their presence, is contrary to article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\"\u009d The court also noted with \"grave concern\"\u009d that Israel's settlement policy has been expanding. The court also found that Israel's use of natural resources was \"inconsistent\"\u009d with its obligations under international law as an occupying power. Friday's ruling comes against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies. Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.

Israel, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\"\u009d address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\u009d The Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations. Erwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\u009d He said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\u009d It would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\"\u009d - such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel. He said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\u009d It is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\"\u009d Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated. Israel says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank. The U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting. Israel has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now.

Authorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press.

It said other nations were obliged not to \"render aid or assistance in maintaining\" Israel's presence in the territories. It said Israel must end settlement construction immediately and that existing settlements must be removed, according to a summary of the more than 80-page opinion read out by court President Nawaf Salam.\n\nIsrael's \"abuse of its status as the occupying power\" renders its \"presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful,\" the court said, saying its presence must be ended as \"rapidly as possible.\"\n\nThe court's opinion, sought by the U.N. General Assembly after a Palestinian request, came against the backdrop of Israel's devastating military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nThe court said the General Assembly and Security Council -- where staunch Israeli ally the United States holds a veto -- should consider \"the precise modalities\" to end Israel's presence in the territories.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, didn't send a legal team to the hearings. Instead, it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has been stagnant for more than a decade.\n\n\"The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land -- not in our eternal capital Jerusalem and not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office, using the biblical terms for the West Bank. \"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\"\n\nSpeaking outside the court, Riad Malki, an adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called the opinion \"a watershed moment for Palestine, for justice and for international law.\"\n\nHe said other nations must now \"uphold the clear obligations\" outlined by the court. \"No actions of any kind ... to support Israel's illegal occupation.\"\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved populations there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that isn't internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nThe court's decision strikes at the heart of the ambiguity of Israel's administration of the territories. Israel hasn't annexed the West Bank -- though settler groups have pressed it to do so -- but it calls it part of its homeland and has effectively treated it as an extension of the nation. Along with the settlements, it has appropriated large swaths of the territory as \"state lands.\" At the same time, Netanyahu's government has repeatedly rejected the creation of any Palestinian state. Abbas' Palestinian Authority has been restricted to control over divided enclaves scattered around the West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments at hearings in February, along with 49 other nations and three international organizations. In the hearings, Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said before the decision that a ruling that Israel's policies breach international law would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would remove \"any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\" It could also increase the number of countries that recognize a Palestinian state, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland, he said.\n\nIt's not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab, because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nNetanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.", "source": {"uri": "weareiowa.com",

It said Israel must end settlement construction immediately.\n\nIt said such acts render \"Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful.\"\u009d It says its continued presence was \"\u009dillegal\"\u009d and should be ended as \"rapidly as possible.\"\u009d\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has stagnant for more than a decade.\n\nIn the opinion read out by court President Nawaf Salam, the court found that \"the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as Israel's maintenance of their presence, is contrary to article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\"\u009d The court also noted with \"grave concern\"\u009d that Israel's settlement policy has been expanding.\n\nThe court also found that Israel's use of natural resources was \"inconsistent\"\u009d with its obligations under international law as an occupying power.\n\nFriday's ruling comes against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\"\u009d address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\u009d\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\u009d\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\u009d\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\"\u009d - such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\u009d\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\"\u009d Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri":

[Getty]\n\nThe United Nations' highest court said that Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories are illegal and all states should cooperate to bring an end to Israel's war on Gaza, in an important advisory opinion issued on Friday.\n\nThe findings by judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), known as the World Court, are not binding but carry weight under international law and may weaken support for Israel.\n\n\"Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law,\" President Nawaf Salam said, reading the findings of a 15-judge panel.\n\nThe opinion said that Israel should pay reparations to Palestinians for damages caused by the occupation.\n\nIt also found that the UN Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognise the occupation as legal and not to give aid or support toward maintaining it.\n\nThe ICJ concluded that Israel's policies and practices in the Palestinian territories amount to the annexation of significant portions of these areas.\n\nFurthermore, the court determined that Israel systematically discriminates against Palestinians in the occupied territories, as it argued the unlawful nature of Israel's continued presence there.\n\nThe case stems from a 2022 request from the UN General Assembly, predating the war in Gaza that began in October.\n\nIsrael has occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem -- areas of historic Palestine which the Palestinians want for a state -- since the 1967 War and has since built settlements in the West Bank and steadily expanded them.\n\nIsraeli leaders have argued the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as Israeli-occupied territory.\n\nIn February, more than 50 states presented their views before the court, with Palestinian representatives asking the court to find that Israel must withdraw from all the occupied areas and dismantle illegal settlements.\n\nIsrael did not participate in the hearings but filed a written statement telling the court that issuing an advisory opinion would be \"harmful\" to attempts to resolve the conflict.\n\nThe majority of states participating asked the court to find the occupation illegal, while a handful, including Canada and Britain, argued it should refuse to give an advisory opinion.\n\nThe United States, Israel's strongest backer, urged the court to limit any advisory opinion and not order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories.\n\nIn 2004, the ICJ gave an advisory ruling that an Israeli separation barrier around most of the West Bank was \"contrary to international law\" and Israeli settlements were established in breach of international law. Israel dismissed the ruling and has continued settlement construction and expansion.", "source": {"uri": "newarab.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Arab"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advisory opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Six-Day War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annexation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli West Bank barrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.newarab.com/sites/default/files/styles/600x338/public/2154420216.jpeg?h=a5f2f23a&itok=FIM6h6Sp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745204", "eventUri": "eng-9745204", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

It said other nations were obliged not to \"render aid or assistance in maintaining\" Israel's presence in the territories. It said Israel must end settlement construction immediately and that existing settlements must be removed, according to a summary of the more than 80-page opinion read out by court President Nawaf Salam.\n\nIsrael's \"abuse of its status as the occupying power\" renders its \"presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful,\" the court said, saying its presence must be ended as \"rapidly as possible.\"\n\nThe court's opinion, sought by the U.N. General Assembly after a Palestinian request, came against the backdrop of Israel's devastating military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nThe court said the General Assembly and Security Council -- where staunch Israeli ally the United States holds a veto -- should consider \"the precise modalities\" to end Israel's presence in the territories.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, didn't send a legal team to the hearings. Instead, it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has been stagnant for more than a decade.\n\n\"The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land -- not in our eternal capital Jerusalem and not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office, using the biblical terms for the West Bank. \"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\"\n\nSpeaking outside the court, Riad Malki, an adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called the opinion \"a watershed moment for Palestine, for justice and for international law.\"\n\nHe said other nations must now \"uphold the clear obligations\" outlined by the court. \"No actions of any kind ... to support Israel's illegal occupation.\"\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved populations there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that isn't internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nThe court's decision strikes at the heart of the ambiguity of Israel's administration of the territories. Israel hasn't annexed the West Bank -- though settler groups have pressed it to do so -- but it calls it part of its homeland and has effectively treated it as an extension of the nation. Along with the settlements, it has appropriated large swaths of the territory as \"state lands.\" At the same time, Netanyahu's government has repeatedly rejected the creation of any Palestinian state. Abbas' Palestinian Authority has been restricted to control over divided enclaves scattered around the West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments at hearings in February, along with 49 other nations and three international organizations. In the hearings, Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said before the decision that a ruling that Israel's policies breach international law would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would remove \"any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\" It could also increase the number of countries that recognize a Palestinian state, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland, he said.\n\nIt's not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab, because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe court said that Israel's construction of settlements in the West Bank violated international laws prohibiting countries from moving their population into territories they occupy.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group. Their residents are Israeli citizens governed by domestic law and served by government ministries, services, banks and other businesses -- effectively integrating them into Israel.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nNetanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com",

Tsafrir Abayov/Associated Press\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The top U.N. court ruled Friday that Israel's presence in the Palestinian occupied territories is \"unlawful\" and called on it to end, pointing to the building and expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, and east Jerusalem, its annexation and imposition of permanent control over lands and discriminatory policies against Palestinians.\n\nThe International Court of Justice was issuing a non-binding opinion on the legality of Israel's 57-year occupation of lands sought for a Palestinian state, and the ruling is likely to have more effect on international opinion than it will on Israeli policies.\n\nThe court's panel of 15 judges from around the world said Israel has abused its status as the occupying power in the West Bank and east Jerusalem by carrying out policies of annexing territory, imposing permanent control and building settlements. It said Israel must end settlement construction immediately.\n\nIt said such acts render \"Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful.\" It says its continued presence was \"illegal\" and should be ended as \"rapidly as possible.\"\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has stagnant for more than a decade.\n\nIn the opinion read out by court President Nawaf Salam, the court found that \"the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as Israel's maintenance of their presence, is contrary to article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\" The court also noted with \"grave concern\" that Israel's settlement policy has been expanding.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe court also found that Israel's use of natural resources was \"inconsistent\" with its obligations under international law as an occupying power.\n\nFriday's ruling comes against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" - such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are

It marks the first time the ICJ has delivered a position on the legality of the 57-year occupation.\n\nThe ICJ, based at The Hague in the Netherlands, has been examining the issue since the beginning of last year, at the request of the UN General Assembly.\n\nThe court was specifically asked to give its view on Israel's policies and practices towards the Palestinians, and on the legal status of the occupation.\n\nDelivering the court's findings, ICJ President Nawaf Salam said it had found that \"Israel's... continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is illegal.\"\n\n\"The State of Israel is under the obligation to bring an end to its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible,\" he said.\n\nHe said Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005 did not bring Israel's occupation of that area to an end because it still exercises effective control over it.\n\nThe court also said Israel should evacuate all of its settlers from the West Bank and East Jerusalem and pay reparations to Palestinians for damages caused by the occupation.\n\nIsrael has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967. The court said the settlements were illegal. Israel has consistently disputed that they are against international law.\n\nThe ICJ said Israel's \"policies and practices amount to annexation of large parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory\", which it said was against international law, adding that Israel was \"not entitled to sovereignty\" over any part of the occupied territories.\n\nIsrael claims sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem, the eastern half of which it captured in the 1967 Middle East war. It considers the city its indivisible capital - something which is not accepted by the vast majority of the international community.\n\nAmong its other far-reaching conclusions, the court said Israeli restrictions on Palestinians in the occupied territories constituted \"systemic discrimination based on, inter alia, race, religion or ethnic origin\". It also said Israel had illegally exploited the Palestinians' natural resources and violated their right to self-determination.\n\nThe court also advised states to avoid any actions, including providing aid or assistance, that would maintain the current situation.\n\nIsrael's prime minister swiftly issued a blunt statement rejecting what the court had determined.\n\n\"The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land - not in our eternal capital Jerusalem, nor in our ancestral heritage of Judea and Samaria\" (the West Bank), Mr Netanyahu said in a statement.\n\n\"No decision of lies in The Hague will distort this historical truth, and similarly, the legality of Israeli settlements in all parts of our homeland cannot be disputed.\"\n\nBut the court's findings were welcomed by the Palestinians.\n\nHussein Al Sheikh, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), the Palestinians' main umbrella group, called it \"a historic victory for the rights of the Palestinian people and their right to self-determination. And the collapse and defeat of the Judaization project through confiscation, settlement, displacement, and racist practices against a people under occupation.\n\n\"The international community must respect the opinion of international justice and force Israel to end its occupation of the Palestinian territories,\" he said.\n\nThe court's findings will now go to the UN General Assembly, which will decide how to respond, including the option of adopting a resolution. That would be significant and could constitute a catalyst for negotiations and set the legal parameters for a future negotiated settlement.\n\nThis case is separate from another active case brought to the ICJ by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians in the war in Gaza.\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online

But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has stagnant for more than a decade.\n\nIn response to the ruling, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the West Bank and east Jerusalem were part of the Jewish people's historical \"homeland.\"\n\n\"The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land - not in our eternal capital Jerusalem and not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" he said in a post on the social media platform X. \"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\"\n\nThe court's opinion, sought by the U.N. General Assembly after a Palestinian request, is unlikely to effect Israel's policy. But its resounding breadth -- including saying Israel could not claim sovereignty in the territories and was impeding Palestinians' right to self-determination -- could impact international opinion.\n\nIt came against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nNetanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press.

The UN's top court handed down its view, declaring 'illegal' Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories since 1967\n\nThe ICJ has ruled that Israel's settlement policy and use of natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territories violate international law. Pictured: Palestinian shepherd Mustafa Arara, 24, stands in the ruins of the West Bank Bedouin village of al-Baqa where residents fled in July after settlers established an outpost a stone's throw from the village in June.\n\nBut Netanyahu slammed the International Court of Justice, saying it had made a 'decision of lies' on Friday by ruling the county's occupation of the Palestinian territories illegal.\n\n'The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land - not in our eternal capital Jerusalem, nor in our ancestral heritage of Judea and Samaria' (the occupied West Bank), Netanyahu said in a statement.\n\n'No decision of lies in The Hague will distort this historical truth, and similarly, the legality of Israeli settlements in all parts of our homeland cannot be disputed.'\n\nNetanyahu said the West Bank and east Jerusalem were part of the Jewish people's historical 'homeland.'\n\nRead More Adidas DROPS Bella Hadid from advertising campaign for retro sneakers referencing 1972 Olympics\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings.\n\nBut it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns.\n\nIsraeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has stagnant for more than a decade.\n\nThe court's opinion, sought by the UN General Assembly after a Palestinian request, is unlikely to effect Israel's policy.\n\nBut its resounding breadth - including saying Israel could not claim sovereignty in the territories and was impeding Palestinians' right to self-determination - could impact international opinion.\n\nIt came against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel.\n\nIn a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nThe ruling came against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel.

It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.'\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of 'those who seek to advocate against it' - such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.'\n\nPalestinian Foreign Minister, Riyad al-Maliki (L) greets a member of the diplomatic corps as he attends a non-binding ruling on the legal consequences of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem at the International Court of Justice\n\nForeign Minister of Palestine, Riyad al-Maliki (R) and Palestinian Ambassador to the United Nations, Riyad Mansour (L)\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was 'contrary to international law.' Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now.\n\nThe West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15 per cent in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital.\n\nPalestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nNetanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy.\n\nSmotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over

It said Israel must end settlement construction immediately.\n\nIt said such acts render \"Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful.\" It says its continued presence was \"illegal\" and should be ended as \"rapidly as possible.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has stagnant for more than a decade.\n\nIn the opinion read out by court President Nawaf Salam, the court found that \"the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as Israel's maintenance of their presence, is contrary to article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\" The court also noted with \"grave concern\" that Israel's settlement policy has been expanding.\n\nThe court also found that Israel's use of natural resources was \"inconsistent\" with its obligations under international law as an occupying power.\n\nFriday's ruling comes against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri": "kfdm.com",

The international community must force Israel to end the occupation,\" B'Tselem, a Jerusalem-based nonprofit organization that documents human rights violations in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe court's advisory opinion is not legally binding, but it could have a significant political impact as Israel faces mounting backlash and isolation over its deadly military offensive in Gaza, where nearly 39,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed since the war began, according to local health officials.\n\nIt also comes just a day after Israel's parliament, the Knesset, voted overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state, despite growing pressure from the global community, including from the United States, which has for decades officially supported the idea of a two-state solution.\n\nThe ICJ's opinion Friday is separate from another ongoing case brought to the court by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide in its offensive in Gaza, an accusation both the U.S. and Israel have denied.\n\nThe General Assembly had asked the ICJ to weigh in on the \"legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\"\n\nIt also asked the court to give its opinion on how the policies and practice of Israel affected the \"legal status of the occupation\" and what the legal consequences might be \"for all States and the United Nations.\"\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in 1967 during the Six-Day War. In 2005, faced with international and domestic pressure, Israel withdrew troops and thousands of Israeli settlers from Gaza, leaving the enclave to be governed by the Palestinian Authority while continuing its occupation of the West Bank and Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas was elected into power, replacing the Palestinian Authority as Gaza's governing body. In response, Israel significantly tightened its control over Gaza's borders, coastline and airspace, imposing a blockade that, for 17 years, has crippled Gaza's economy, with a widespread, devastating impact on Palestinian civilians' daily lives. Israel says that the blockade is required to ensure the safety of its population from Hamas.\n\nAcross the West Bank, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have built sweeping settlements, many of which have displaced Palestinian communities. The international community largely considers these settlements to be illegal.\n\nIn March, Israel also approved the appropriation of nearly 5 square miles of land in the Jordan Valley, in the largest seizure of land in the West Bank in decades. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric called the move \"a step in the wrong direction,\" adding: \"The direction we want to be heading is to find a negotiated two-state solution.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem, where the city's most sensitive holy sites are based, is not internationally recognized.\n\nAs an occupying power, Israel's actions in the territories are expected to comply with rules under international law that govern occupation.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said Israel does not recognize the legitimacy of the discussions at the ICJ. He decried the case as part of a \"Palestinian attempt to dictate the results\" of a political agreement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without negotiations.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com",

The top UN court noted that Israel's settlement policy and the exploitation of natural resources in the occupied Palestinian territories breach international law.\n\nIt also said Israel must make reparations for damages caused by its occupation of the Palestinian territories, highlighting the construction and expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the annexation and ongoing control of these territories, and the implementation of discriminatory policies against Palestinians.\n\nThe court's panel of 15 judges stated that Israel's transfer of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem, as well as the maintenance of their presence, violates Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Additionally, the use of natural resources by Israel was deemed inconsistent with its obligations under international law as an occupying power.\n\nAlso read | UN inquiry finds Israel and Hamas committed war crimes, Hamas submits response to Gaza ceasefire plan\n\nThe ruling, delivered by ICJ President Nawaf Salam, comes as part of a non-binding advisory opinion on the legality of Israel's 57-year occupation of lands sought for a Palestinian state. While this ruling might influence international opinion more than Israeli policy, it does not directly alter Israeli practices.\n\nThe ICJ's opinion is delivered against the backdrop of ongoing violence in Gaza and a separate case where Israel is accused of genocide. The court's past rulings, including a 2004 decision that Israel's West Bank barrier was illegal, have faced boycotts from Israel, which considers such proceedings politically motivated.\n\nThe current advisory opinion, requested by the UN General Assembly in December 2022, reflects widespread international concern about Israeli settlement activities and their impact on peace efforts. Despite opposition from Israel, which argues that the court's questions are biased and ignore security concerns, the ruling may further isolate Israel internationally and bolster movements advocating for Palestinian state recognition and other actions against Israeli policies.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advisory opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaf_Salam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nawaf Salam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fourth Geneva Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annexation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomatic recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli West Bank barrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boycott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/02/2024-02-21T115845Z_1390294301_RC2X66AQXISA_RTRMADP_5_ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-WORLD-COURT.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745204", "eventUri": "eng-9745204", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The advisory opinion is not binding, but carries \"authority and legal weight,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nJudge Nawaf Salam, reading out the Court's opinion, said that Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem constitutes \"de facto annexation,\" and that it infringes on the rights of the Palestinian people for self-determination. Therefore, Salam said, Israel should fully end their occupation of those territories outside its 1967 borders, provide reparations to Palestinians harmed by occupation, cease the construction of new settlements, and dismantle settlements that currently exist.\n\nOf the 15-member court, 11 members agreed on every provision of the opinion. Several members of the court also argued what most human rights organizations have said for decades: that Israel's policies in the West Bank constitute \"racial segregation or apartheid.\"\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly had requested the opinion on the legal consequences of Israel's occupation in Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem in January 2023, prior to the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel and Israel's military incursion into Gaza. This opinion is separate from the ongoing deliberations over South Africa's case regarding genocide in Gaza.\n\nIn the opinion, the ICJ focused entirely on the West Bank and East Jerusalem and excluded \"conduct by Israel in the Gaza Strip\" since October 7th, 2023. Still, the court noted that Israel's 2005 withdrawal from Gaza \"has not entirely released it of its obligations under the law of occupation\" to those living in the strip.\n\nIn the West Bank the court stated that Israel is in violation of several articles of the Geneva Conventions, due to their seizure of Palestinian land; maintenance of separate settler infrastructure such as roads and water systems which Palestinians are forbidden to use; and diversion of territory's natural resources towards settlers which \"constitute annexation.\"\n\nThis annexation, the court added, is bolstered by Israel's system of incentives encouraging its citizens to live in the occupied territories. This includes subsidies for new housing construction, and education benefits for Israeli students living in settlements over the Green Line, the border separating Israel from the territories it captured in the 1967 Six-Day War.\n\n\"Israel must cease all settlement activity,\" the opinion concluded, \"repeal all legislation or measures creating or maintaining the unlawful situation\" and repeal \"all measures aimed at modifying the demographic composition of any parts of the territory.\"\n\nThe court also said Israel must help settlers living in the West Bank find somewhere else to go, and quickly, calling for the \"evacuation of all settlers from the settlements,\" so that Israel might \"bring an end to its presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible.\" Then, Palestinian land and property might be returned. In cases where restitution is \"materially impossible,\" the Court told Israel to provide compensation to all persons who \"suffered any form of material damage as a result of Israel's wrongful acts under the occupation.\"\n\nWithin Israel, this opinion isn't likely to sway much. On July 18th, the day before the court issued its opinion, Israel's legislature voted overwhelmingly against the possibility of establishing a Palestinian state. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already derided the ICJ's opinion as a \"decision of lies.\" But Israel is not the only country whose obligations are laid out under the ruling.\n\nThe court also spoke to the obligations of other states and international bodies towards Israel and Palestine: All states, they said, are obligated not to recognize Israel's ongoing presence in the West Bank as legal and \"not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel's illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\"\n\nThat means US tax breaks for nonprofits funding West Bank settler organizations could be in violation of this clause. (The US makes a habit of ignoring ICC and ICJ rulings, and has recently threatened to sanction the court for going against its interests.) In February, US State Department representatives told the ICJ that they should not rule in support of an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories -- which is exactly what the ICJ just did.",

In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognised, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognise Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens\", address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders\".\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organisations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view\".\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project\".\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognise the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe UN General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15 per cent in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighbourhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalise outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri": "orissapost.com",

General Assembly had asked the ICJ to weigh in on the \"legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\"\n\nIt also asked the court to give its opinion on how the policies and practice of Israel affected the \"legal status of the occupation\" and what the legal consequences might be \"for all States and the United Nations.\"\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in 1967 during the Six-Day War. In 2005, faced with international and domestic pressure, Israel withdrew troops and thousands of Israeli settlers from Gaza, leaving the enclave to be governed by the Palestinian Authority while continuing its occupation of the West Bank and Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas was elected into power, replacing the Palestinian Authority as Gaza's governing body. In response, Israel significantly tightened its control over Gaza's borders, coastline and airspace, imposing a blockade that, for 17 years, has crippled Gaza's economy, with a widespread, devastating impact on Palestinian civilians' daily lives. Israel says that the blockade is required to ensure the safety of its population from Hamas.\n\nAcross the West Bank, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have built sweeping settlements, many of which have displaced Palestinian communities. The internationally community largely considers these settlements to be illegal.\n\nIn March 2024, Israel also approved the appropriation of nearly 5 square miles of land in the Jordan Valley, in the largest seizure of land in the West Bank in decades. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric called the move \"a step in the wrong direction,\" adding: \"The direction we want to be heading is to find a negotiated two-state solution.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem, where the city's most sensitive holy sites are based, is not internationally recognized.\n\nAs an occupying power, Israel's actions in the territories are expected to comply with rules under international law that govern occupation.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said Israel does not recognize the legitimacy of the discussions at the ICJ. He decried the case as part of a \"Palestinian attempt to dictate the results\" of a political agreement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without negotiations.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com",

However, it submitted written comments, arguing that the questions posed to the court were prejudiced and did not consider Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have claimed that the court's involvement could undermine the peace process, which has been stagnant for over a decade.\n\nIn response to the ruling, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated that the West Bank and east Jerusalem are part of the Jewish people's historical \"homeland.\" He stated on social media, \"The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land - not in our eternal capital Jerusalem and not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria.\" He dismissed the court's decision as a distortion of historical truth and argued that the legality of Israeli settlements in these territories is indisputable.\n\nWhile the court's opinion, sought by the UN General Assembly following a Palestinian request, is unlikely to alter Israel's policy, its comprehensive nature, including the assertion that Israel cannot claim sovereignty in the territories and is obstructing Palestinians' right to self-determination, could influence international opinion.\n\nThis development comes amid Israel's ongoing 10-month military campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. Separately, the ICJ is considering a South African claim that Israel's actions in Gaza amount to genocide, a charge that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians aim to establish an independent state in these areas. Israel views the West Bank as disputed territory, whose future should be determined through negotiations, and has established settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move unrecognised internationally, and while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005, it has maintained a blockade since Hamas took control in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nDuring hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of \"apartheid\" and urged the court to declare that Israel's occupation is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for a two-state solution to remain viable. The Palestinians presented their case alongside 49 other nations and three international organisations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, suggested that if the court finds Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem to be in breach of international law, it could \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\" Such a ruling would weaken the justification for occupation and bolster advocates for boycotts, divestment, and sanctions against Israel. It could also encourage more countries, particularly in the Western world, to recognise the state of Palestine.\n\nThis is not the first time the ICJ has issued an opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, claiming they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael maintains that the barrier is a security measure, while Palestinians view it as a land grab since it frequently extends into the West Bank.\n\nAccording to Peace Now, an anti-settlement monitoring group, Israel has built over 100 settlements in the West Bank, with the settler population growing by more than 15% in the past five years to over 500,000 Israelis. Israel has also annexed east Jerusalem, with 200,000 Israelis living in settlements there, which Israel considers neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinians in the city face systematic discrimination, hindering their ability to build or expand homes.\n\nThe international community generally views all settlements as illegal and obstacles to peace, as they are constructed on land sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nNetanyahu's hard-line government, dominated by settlers and their political supporters, has given unprecedented authority over settlement policy to finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader. Smotrich has advanced plans for more settlement homes and legalised outposts. Authorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometres of land in the Jordan Valley, marking the largest single appropriation since the 1993 Oslo accords.\n\nThe court's decision could significantly impact the international perception of Israel's policies and the broader Middle East peace process.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews

But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" - such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nThe top United Nations court has opened a hearing to deliver a non-binding advisory opinion on the legality of Israel's 57-year occupation of lands sought for a Palestinian state, a ruling that could have more effect on international opinion than it will on Israeli policies.\n\nInternational Court of Justice President Nawaf Salam is expected to take about an hour to read out the opinion of the panel that is made up of 15 judges from around the world.\n\nFriday's hearing comes against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war.

No assistance. No complicity. No money, no arms, no trade... no actions of any kind to support Israel's illegal occupation,\" Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said outside the court in The Hague.\n\nThe case stems from a 2022 request for a legal opinion from the UN General Assembly, predating the war in Gaza that began in October.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem -- areas of historic Palestine which the Palestinians want for a state -- in the 1967 Middle East war and has since built settlements in the West Bank and steadily expanded them.\n\nIsraeli leaders argue the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the UN and most of the international community regard them as occupied territory.\n\nIn February, more than 50 states presented their views before the court, with Palestinian representatives asking the court to find that Israel must withdraw from all the occupied areas and dismantle illegal settlements.\n\nIsrael did not participate in the oral hearings but filed a written statement telling the court that issuing an advisory opinion would be \"harmful\" to attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe majority of states participating asked the court to find the occupation illegal, while a handful, including Canada and Britain, argued it should refuse to give an advisory opinion.\n\nThe US -- Israel's biggest military ally and supporter -- had asked the court not to order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories. The position of the US was that the ICJ should issue no decision that could hurt negotiations towards a two-state solution on a \"land for peace\" principle.\n\nIn 2004 the ICJ gave an advisory ruling that an Israeli separation barrier around most of the West Bank was illegal and Israeli settlements were established in breach of international law.

But it puts more pressure on Israel, which is waging a war against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza that has sparked widespread concern over the more than 38,000 Gazans who have died in roughly ten months of fighting. The ICJ also calls for all states to not assist Israel in any way with its occupation of Palestinian territories.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza in a 1967 war. Israel returned Gaza to the rule of Palestinians in 2005 but continue to have authority over the West Bank and East Jerusalem, where Palestinians live.\n\nIsrael has been accused of violating international law by encroaching into Palestinian territory through the expansion of Israeli settlements, an issue that even Israel's most ardent ally, the U.S., has called the nation out on. It has also come under pressure for a harsh rule over the Palestinian people in occupied territories.\n\nThe United Nations said over the spring that the size of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem increased dramatically from November 2022 to October 2023, with more than 24,000 housing units in that period.\n\nThe ICJ case was brought before the court after a 2022 request from the United Nations General Assembly to seek an opinion from the court on the impact of Israeli settlements and occupation in Palestinian territory.\n\nThe court heard from some 52 countries, including the state of Palestine, on the issue, the largest bloc of nations in one case since the ICJ was founded in 1945. Oral arguments were made in February.\n\nIsrael has often accused the United Nations of being biased and unfair. It did not present arguments at the ICJ case but submitted written arguments.\n\nAfter the opinion, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on social media platform X that \"the Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land - neither in our eternal capital Jerusalem nor in the land of our ancestors in\" the West Bank.\n\n\"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be disputed,\" he wrote.\n\nThe ICJ is also hearing a separate case filed by South Africa over the war in Gaza, with South African officials accusing Israel of genocide.

It said other nations were obliged not to \"render aid or assistance in maintaining\" Israel's presence in the territories. It said Israel must end settlement construction immediately and that existing settlements must be removed, according to a summary of the more than 80-page opinion read out by court President Nawaf Salam.\n\nIsrael's \"abuse of its status as the occupying power\" renders its \"presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful,\" the court said, saying its presence must be ended as \"rapidly as possible.\"\n\nThe court's opinion, sought by the U.N. General Assembly after a Palestinian request, came against the backdrop of Israel's devastating military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nThe court said the General Assembly and Security Council -- where staunch Israeli ally the United States holds a veto -- should consider \"the precise modalities\" to end Israel's presence in the territories.\n\nRELATED STORY | Israeli leader Netanyahu to meet Biden at the White House, per source\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, didn't send a legal team to the hearings. Instead, it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has been stagnant for more than a decade.\n\n\"The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land -- not in our eternal capital Jerusalem and not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office, using the biblical terms for the West Bank. \"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\"\n\nSpeaking outside the court, Riad Malki, an adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called the opinion \"a watershed moment for Palestine, for justice and for international law.\"\n\nHe said other nations must now \"uphold the clear obligations\" outlined by the court. \"No actions of any kind ... to support Israel's illegal occupation.\"\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved populations there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed East Jerusalem in a move that isn't internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nThe court's decision strikes at the heart of the ambiguity of Israel's administration of the territories. Israel hasn't annexed the West Bank -- though settler groups have pressed it to do so -- but it calls it part of its homeland and has effectively treated it as an extension of the nation. Along with the settlements, it has appropriated large swaths of the territory as \"state lands.\" At the same time, Netanyahu's government has repeatedly rejected the creation of any Palestinian state. Abbas' Palestinian Authority has been restricted to control over divided enclaves scattered around the West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments at hearings in February, along with 49 other nations and three international organizations. In the hearings, Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nRELATED STORY | Ultra-Orthodox protest against order to enlist in Israeli military turns violent in Jerusalem\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said before the decision that a ruling that Israel's policies breach international law would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would remove \"any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\" It could also increase the number of countries that recognize a Palestinian state, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland, he said.\n\nIt's not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab, because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe court said that Israel's construction of settlements in the West Bank violated international laws prohibiting countries from moving their population into territories they occupy.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group. Their residents are Israeli citizens governed by domestic law and served by government ministries, services, banks and other businesses -- effectively integrating them into Israel.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nNetanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters.

The international community must force Israel to end the occupation,\" B'Tselem, a Jerusalem-based nonprofit organization that documents human rights violations in the Palestinian territories, said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe court's advisory opinion is not legally binding, but it could have a significant political impact as Israel faces mounting backlash and isolation over its deadly military offensive in Gaza, where nearly 39,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed since the war began, according to local health officials.\n\nIt also comes just a day after Israel's parliament, the Knesset, voted overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state, despite growing pressure from the global community, including from the United States, which has for decades officially supported the idea of a two-state solution.\n\nThe ICJ's opinion Friday is separate from another ongoing case brought to the court by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide in its offensive in Gaza, an accusation both the U.S. and Israel have denied.\n\nThe General Assembly had asked the ICJ to weigh in on the \"legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\"\n\nIt also asked the court to give its opinion on how the policies and practice of Israel affected the \"legal status of the occupation\" and what the legal consequences might be \"for all States and the United Nations.\"\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in 1967 during the Six-Day War. In 2005, faced with international and domestic pressure, Israel withdrew troops and thousands of Israeli settlers from Gaza, leaving the enclave to be governed by the Palestinian Authority while continuing its occupation of the West Bank and Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas was elected into power, replacing the Palestinian Authority as Gaza's governing body. In response, Israel significantly tightened its control over Gaza's borders, coastline and airspace, imposing a blockade that, for 17 years, has crippled Gaza's economy, with a widespread, devastating impact on Palestinian civilians' daily lives. Israel says that the blockade is required to ensure the safety of its population from Hamas.\n\nAcross the West Bank, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have built sweeping settlements, many of which have displaced Palestinian communities. The international community largely considers these settlements to be illegal.\n\nIn March, Israel also approved the appropriation of nearly 5 square miles of land in the Jordan Valley, in the largest seizure of land in the West Bank in decades. U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric called the move \"a step in the wrong direction,\" adding: \"The direction we want to be heading is to find a negotiated two-state solution.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israel's annexation of east Jerusalem, where the city's most sensitive holy sites are based, is not internationally recognized.\n\nAs an occupying power, Israel's actions in the territories are expected to comply with rules under international law that govern occupation.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously said Israel does not recognize the legitimacy of the discussions at the ICJ. He decried the case as part of a \"Palestinian attempt to dictate the results\" of a political agreement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict without negotiations.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com",

In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news",

In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognised, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognise Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens\", address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders\".\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organisations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view\".\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project\".\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognise the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe UN General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15 per cent in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighbourhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalise outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.

The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold.\n\nIt has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognised, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007.\n\nThe international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian foreign minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law\".\n\nIsrael boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe UN General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighbourhoods of its capital.\n\nPalestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nMr Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters.\n\nMr Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy.\n\nMr Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalise outposts.", "source": {"uri": "bournemouthecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Echo Sport"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

No money, no arms, no trade...no actions of any kind to support Israel's illegal occupation,\" Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said outside the court in The Hague.\n\nThe case stems from a 2022 request for a legal opinion from the U.N. General Assembly, predating the war in Gaza that began in October.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem - areas of historic Palestine which the Palestinians want for a state - in the 1967 Middle East war and has since built settlements in the West Bank and steadily expanded them.\n\nIsraeli leaders argue the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as occupied territory.\n\nIn February, more than 50 states presented their views before the court, with Palestinian representatives asking the court to find that Israel must withdraw from all the occupied areas and dismantle illegal settlements.\n\nIsrael did not participate in the oral hearings but filed a written statement telling the court that issuing an advisory opinion would be \"harmful\" to attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe majority of states participating asked the court to find the occupation illegal, while a handful, including Canada and Britain, argued it should refuse to give an advisory opinion.\n\nThe United States had asked the court not to order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe U.S. position was that the court should issue no decision that could hurt negotiations toward a two-state solution on a \"land for peace\" principle.\n\nIn 2004 the ICJ gave an advisory ruling that an Israeli separation barrier around most of the West Bank was illegal and Israeli settlements were established in breach of international law. Israel dismissed that ruling.", "source": {"uri": "iafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iAfrica"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type":

It is tainted with anti-Semitism and lacks understanding of the reality on the ground. It only serves Islamic terrorism and the campaign against Israel.\" He further said the court's decision makes for yet another \"political failure of a dysfunctional [Israeli] government,\" adding that the opposition will mobilize \"to prevent the ruling from being accepted by UN institutions and member states.\"\n\nA non-binding advisory opinion\n\nThe ICJ determination follows a vote by the General Assembly in 2022 to request an advisory opinion on the legality of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. The request was submitted in response to the Palestinian mission to the UN, led by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), asking for an assessment of whether the occupation could be defined as temporary. International law recognizes occupation as legal under certain circumstances, but only if it is temporary, that is, has not been transformed into a permanent annexation of territories.\n\nEighty-seven countries -- including Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- supported the Security Council's decision to seek an advisory opinion, with 23 countries -- including Germany, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States -- opposed. Fifty-two countries abstained.\n\nIn February, the ICJ held several days of hearings on the issue, with representatives of various countries presenting their positions. A delegation from the Israeli Foreign Ministry attended the hearings, but did not directly participate. Rather, the delegation contacted countries considered friendly to Israel in an attempt to influence the outcome.\n\nCritics of Israel claimed that it could no longer be argued that the Israeli occupation is temporary given 57 years of Israeli control over the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza; the constant expansion of settlements and increase in Jewish settlers; and calls by Israeli ministers to annex the West Bank and their opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nIsrael, on the other hand, asserted that the Oslo Accords (1993), which it signed with the PLO, consider Israel's governance of the West Bank an interim phase and, hence, temporary.\n\nSignificant ramifications for Israel\n\nTamar Megiddo, a senior lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who specializes in international law, told Al-Monitor that although the advisory opinion is nonbinding, the ICJ is the most important judicial body chartered by the United Nations. \"As such,\" she said, \"its conclusions, very difficult for Israel, are not to be taken lightly.\"\n\n\"The court said that Israel is in breach of its obligations as an occupying force to the point that its presence in the area has become illegal and that it is acting to annex territories. The court further said Israel has in fact annexed East Jerusalem, and some parts of the West Bank, [and] that it infringes international law on racial segregation. So definitively, [it is] a very critical advisory opinion vis-a-vis Israel,\" Megiddo assessed.\n\n\"Some of the assertations of the court were probably to be expected, and did not come as a surprise, but there were also some determinations that were very severe, especially saying that Israel must end its presence in the area and that it must evacuate all the settlers,\" she said. \"The court also told other countries and the UN that they must bring about the ending of Israel's violations of international law. Such a statement is significant, especially when Israel is in the midst of war in Gaza.\"\n\nMegiddo noted that the ICJ opinion can create difficulties for countries that cooperate with Israel on security issues because the court determined that other parties cannot in any way contribute to the perpetuation of an Israeli presence in the Palestinian territories. For instance, the opinion could affect arms deliveries. It could also be translated into sanctions against Israel and decisions against Israel in the UN General Assembly and the Security Council.\n\nThe court, Megiddo further explained, does not recognize the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza as ending the occupation there, because Israel maintains certain parameters of occupation -- such as control of Gaza's borders via land, sea and air.\n\n\"This affirmation [of Gaza's status] has far-fetching significance, because it affects Israel's ability to say it was acting out of self-defense after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas,\" Megiddo said. She believes Israel's defense of itself will be much more challenging in the ICJ's ongoing deliberations on the complaint submitted in December 2023 by South Africa claiming that Israel is carrying out genocidal acts in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognise the occupation as legal nor \"render aid or assistance\" toward maintaining Israel's presence in the occupied territories.\n\nThe United Nations' highest court said on Friday that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible, in its strongest findings to date on the Israel-Palestinian conflict. The advisory opinion by judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), known as the World Court, was not binding but carries weight under international law and may weaken support for Israel.\n\n\"Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law,\" President Nawaf Salam said, reading the findings of a 15-judge panel. The court said Israel's obligations include paying restitution for harm and \"the evacuation of all settlers from existing settlements\".\n\nIn a swift reaction, Israel's foreign ministry rejected the opinion as \"fundamentally wrong\" and one-sided, and repeated its stance that a political settlement in the region can only be reached by negotiations. \"The Jewish nation cannot be an occupier in its own land,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement.\n\nThe opinion also angered West Bank settlers as well as politicians such as Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, whose nationalist religious party is close to the settler movement and who himself lives in a West Bank settlement. \"The answer to The Hague - Sovereignty now\" he said in a post on the social media platform X, in an apparent appeal to formally annex the West Bank.\n\nIsrael Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, one of the largest settler councils, said the ICJ opinion was \"contrary to the Bible, morality and international law\". 'NO COMPLICITY'\n\nThe ICJ opinion also found that the U.N. Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognise the occupation as legal nor \"render aid or assistance\" toward maintaining Israel's presence in the occupied territories. The United States is Israel's biggest military ally and supporter.\n\nThe Palestinian Foreign Ministry called the opinion \"historic\" and urged states to adhere to it. \"No aid. No assistance. No complicity. No money, no arms, no trade...no actions of any kind to support Israel's illegal occupation,\" Palestinian envoy Riyad al-Maliki said outside the court in The Hague.\n\nThe case stems from a 2022 request for a legal opinion from the U.N. General Assembly, predating the war in Gaza that began in October. Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem - areas of historic Palestine which the Palestinians want for a state - in the 1967 Middle East war and has since built settlements in the West Bank and steadily expanded them.\n\nIsraeli leaders argue the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as occupied territory. In February, more than 50 states presented their views before the court, with Palestinian representatives asking the court to find that Israel must withdraw from all the occupied areas and dismantle illegal settlements.\n\nIsrael did not participate in the oral hearings but filed a written statement telling the court that issuing an advisory opinion would be \"harmful\" to attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The majority of states participating asked the court to find the occupation illegal, while a handful, including Canada and Britain, argued it should refuse to give an advisory opinion.\n\nThe United States had asked the court not to order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories. The U.S. position was that the court should issue no decision that could hurt negotiations toward a two-state solution on a \"land for peace\" principle.\n\nIn 2004 the ICJ gave an advisory ruling that an Israeli separation barrier around most of the West Bank was illegal and Israeli settlements were established in breach of international law. Israel dismissed that ruling.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri":

They warned a prolonged occupation posed an \"extreme danger\" to stability in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nBut the United States said Israel should not be legally obliged to withdraw without taking its \"very real security needs\" into account.\n\nIsrael did not take part in the oral hearings.\n\nInstead, it submitted a written contribution in which it described the questions the court had been asked as \"prejudicial\" and \"tendentious\".\n\n'Ongoing violation'\n\nThe General Assembly asked the ICJ to consider two questions.\n\nFirstly, the court should examine the legal consequences of what the UN called \"the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\".\n\nIn its answer, the ICJ's judges said Israel's \"unlawful policies and practices are in breach\" of its \"obligation to respect the rights of the Palestinian people.\n\nIn June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt.\n\nIsrael then began to settle the 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) of seized Arab territory.\n\nThe UN later declared the occupation of Palestinian territory illegal, and Cairo regained Sinai under its 1979 peace deal with Israel.\n\nNon-binding opinion -\n\nThe ICJ was also asked to look into the consequences of what it described as Israel's \"adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures\".\n\nIn this finding, the ICJ said a \"regime of comprehensive restrictions imposed by Israel on Palestinians consisted of systemic discrimination based on race, religion or ethnic origin.\"\n\nThe ICJ rules in disputes between states.

Picture: DAWOUD ABU ALKAS/REUTERS\n\nThe Hague - The United Nations' highest court said on Friday that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be withdrawn as soon as possible, in its strongest findings to date on the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe advisory opinion by judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), known as the World Court, was not binding but carries weight under international law and may weaken support for Israel.\n\n\"Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law,\" President Nawaf Salam said, reading the findings of a 15-judge panel.\n\nThe court said Israel's obligations include paying restitution for harm and \"the evacuation of all settlers from existing settlements\".\n\nIn a swift reaction, Israel's foreign ministry rejected the opinion as \"fundamentally wrong\" and one-sided, and repeated its stance that a political settlement in the region can only be reached by negotiations.\n\n\"The Jewish nation cannot be an occupier in its own land,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement.\n\nThe opinion also found that the U.N. Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognise the occupation as legal nor \"render aid or assistance\" toward maintaining Israel's presence in the occupied territories.\n\nThe case stems from a 2022 request for a legal opinion from the U.N. General Assembly, predating the war in Gaza that began in October.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem - areas of historic Palestine which the Palestinians want for a state - in the 1967 Middle East war and has since built settlements in the West Bank and steadily expanded them.\n\nIsraeli leaders argue the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as occupied territory.\n\nIn February, more than 50 states presented their views before the court, with Palestinian representatives asking the court to find that Israel must withdraw from all the occupied areas and dismantle illegal settlements.\n\nIsrael did not participate in the oral hearings but filed a written statement telling the court that issuing an advisory opinion would be \"harmful\" to attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe majority of states participating asked the court to find the occupation illegal, while a handful, including Canada and Britain, argued it should refuse to give an advisory opinion.\n\nThe United States, Israel's strongest backer, urged the court to limit any advisory opinion and not order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe U.S. position was that the court should issue no decision that could hurt negotiations toward a two-state solution on a \"land for peace\" principle.\n\nIn 2004 the ICJ gave an advisory ruling that an Israeli separation barrier around most of the West Bank was illegal and Israeli settlements were established in breach of international law. Israel dismissed that ruling.\n\nReuters", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Israel strongly condemned the ruling.\n\nIn late 2022 the General Assembly asked the court to appraise Israel's \"prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation\" of Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, and associated Israeli government policies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem - areas of historic Palestine which the Palestinians want for a state - in the 1967 war and has since built settlements in the West Bank and steadily expanded them.\n\nIsraeli leaders have argued the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard it as Israeli-occupied territory.\n\nIn February, more than 50 states presented their views before the court, with Palestinian representatives asking the court to find that Israel must withdraw from all the occupied areas and dismantle illegal settlements.\n\nIsrael did not participate in the hearings but filed a written statement telling the court that issuing an advisory opinion would be \"harmful\" to attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe majority of states participating asked the court to find the occupation illegal, while a handful, including Canada and Britain, argued it should refuse to give an advisory opinion.\n\nThe United States, Israel's strongest backer, urged the court to limit any advisory opinion and not order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe 15-judge panel will start reading out their opinion at 2pm Irish time. In 2004 the ICJ gave an advisory ruling that an Israeli separation barrier around most of the West Bank was \"contrary to international law\" and Israeli settlements were established in breach of international law. Israel dismissed the ruling. - Reuters", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advisory opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Gaza_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2014 Gaza War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Six-Day War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annexation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_West_Bank_barrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli West Bank barrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/7RO4OLOYS47TRJX2CPF5H424GM.jpg?smart=true&auth=bc7bf3c5fa05f30e46a0c57298885fd74beb0bddcfc15481716f215723c78946&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745204", "eventUri": "eng-9745204", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law.\"\n\nALSO READ: ICJ agrees with SA and orders Israel to ensure more aid reaches Gaza\n\nSalam said the court concluded that from the evidence presented to it and the basis of its analysis, an array of legislation and measures taken by Israel, in its capacity as an occupying power, \"treat Palestinians differently on grounds specified by international law\".\n\n\"The court knows that this differentiation of treatment cannot be justified with reference to reasonable and objective criteria, nor to illegitimate public aim.\n\n\"Accordingly, the court is of the view that the regime of comprehensive restrictions imposed by Israel on Palestinians in the occupied Palestinian territory constitutes systematic discrimination based on inter alia race, religion or ethnic origin,\" Salam said.\n\nThe ICJ said Israel must make reparations for damages caused by its occupation and must end settlement construction immediately.\n\nThe UN General Assembly had asked the court in January last year to deliver an opinion on Israeli \"policies and practices\" toward Palestinians and on the legal status of the occupation of Palestinian territories, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday dismissed the ICJ's decision as false.\n\n\"The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land,\" referring to Jerusalem and the West Bank.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the Palestinian Health Authority, at least 38 848 people have been killed and 89 459 wounded in Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nThe death toll in Israel from Hamas-led attacks on 7 October 2023 is estimated at 1 139 with dozens of people still held captive in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They warned a prolonged occupation posed an \"extreme danger\" to stability in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nBut the United States said Israel should not be legally obliged to withdraw without taking its \"very real security needs\" into account.\n\nIsrael did not take part in the oral hearings.\n\nInstead, it submitted a written contribution in which it described the questions the court had been asked as \"prejudicial\" and \"tendentious\".\n\n'Ongoing violation'\n\nThe General Assembly asked the ICJ to consider two questions.\n\nFirstly, the court should examine the legal consequences of what the U.N. called \"the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\".\n\nThis relates to the \"prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967\" and \"measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem\".\n\nIn June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank including east Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt.\n\nIsrael then began to settle the 70,000 sq. km of seized Arab territory.\n\nThe U.N. later declared the occupation of Palestinian territory illegal, and Cairo regained Sinai under its 1979 peace deal with Israel.\n\nNon-binding opinion\n\nThe ICJ was also asked to look into the consequences of what it described as Israel's \"adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures\".\n\nSecondly, the ICJ was asked to advise on how Israel's actions \"affect the legal status of the occupation\" and what are the consequences for the U.N. and other countries.\n\nThe ICJ rules in disputes between states. Normally, its judgements are binding but it has few means to enforce them.\n\nIn this case however, the opinion is non-binding, although most advisory opinions are in fact acted upon.\n\nThe ICJ has previously issued advisory opinions on the legality of Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia and apartheid South Africa's occupation of Namibia.\n\nIt also handed down an opinion in 2004 declaring that parts of the wall erected by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down.\n\nIsrael has not complied with the ICJ ruling, and has resisted calls to route the barrier along the Green Line, the 1949 Armistice Line established after the end of fighting that accompanied Israel's establishment a year earlier.\n\nRead Comments", "source":

Israel strongly condemned the ruling.\n\nIn late 2022 the General Assembly asked the court to appraise Israel's \"prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation\" of Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, and associated Israeli government policies.

According to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, at least 38,000 people have been killed and 80% of the population displaced in Israel's subsequent war in Gaza, where over 100 hostages are believed to remain.\n\nThe ICJ is expected to rule on the UN General Assembly's questions regarding the legal consequences of Israel's \"continuing violation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\" and \"its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\"\n\nThe ICJ has also been asked to assess how \"the policies and practices of Israel [...] affect the legal status of the occupation,\" as well as the consequences for \"all States and the United Nations.\" The resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 2022 that requested an advisory opinion from the ICJ mentions East Jerusalem, the West Bank and also the \"living conditions of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nThere are a total of 700,000 Israeli settlers in the Wet Bank and East Jerusalem, according to the German dpa news agency. In Resolution 2334 of 2016, the UN Security Council stated that \"Israel's establishment of settlements in Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, had no legal validity, constituting a flagrant violation under international law.\" It also reiterated its demand that \"Israel immediately and completely cease all settlement activities\" in occupied territory.\n\nThe ICJ has also been requested to examine the situation in East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied in the Six-Day War of 1967. The area includes Jerusalem's Old City, which is home to many holy sites that have significance for Islam, Judaism and Christianity. In 1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law declaring the \"complete and united\" city to be the capital of Israel. The UN Security Council declared the law null and void. Few states recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and many international embassies are located in the city of Tel Aviv. The Palestinian Authority has proclaimed East Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital.\n\nThe ICJ held hearings in February where the statementsof the Palestinian territories, 49 UN member states and three international organizations were presented. EU states such as France and Spain also presented statements, as did the United States, Russia and China. Many called for an end to unlawful settlement activity in occupied territory.\n\nIsrael did not attend the hearings but in an earlier written statement submitted in July 2023, it described the questions placed before the ICJ as \"tendentious\" and said that they \"represent a clear distortion of the history and present reality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\"\n\nIn February, the acting legal adviser for the US State Department, Richard Visek, told the ICJ that it should \"not find that Israel is legally obligated to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from occupied territory.\"\n\n\"Any movement towards Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza requires consideration of Israel's very real security needs,\" he said. \"We were all reminded of those security needs on October 7, and they persist.\"\n\nAdvisory opinions are non-binding and the ICJ says that the \"organ, agency or organization remains free to decide, as it sees fit, what effect\" to give them. But it points out that \"the Court's advisory opinions nevertheless carry great legal weight and moral authority. to give to these opinions.\"\n\nIn this case, the ICJ's advisory opinion could increase political pressure on Israel with regard to its war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nStefan Talmon, a professor of international law at the University of Bonn, told DW in a written statement that the ICJ's opinion could have \"far-reaching consequences.\" If it were to find that Israel's occupation, settlement and de-facto annexation of territories were illegal, states that are committed to international law, such as Germany and other EU states, could not ignore the advisory opinion.\n\nHe added that were this to happen, it could have a \"considerably explosive impact,\" and Israel's international position, both legally and politically, could be weakened.\n\nHe also explained that the case could have an impact on national courts as well as the European Court of Justice, if it meant that East Jerusalem or other occupied territories could no longer be incorporated in trade agreements between the EU and Israel, for example.\n\nThe ICJ is currently also deliberating on a case brought forth by South Africa in December 2023, accusing Israel of genocide in light of its military campaign in Gaza. In January, the court delivered an interim judgement, ruling that the case was \"plausible\" and emphasized that there was risk of \"irreparable harm to the Palestinian right to be protected from genocide.\"", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

The vast majority of them arguing that the occupation is illegal and urging the court to declare it as such.\n\nThis development coincides with a separate case brought by South Africa to the ICJ, accusing Israel of committing genocide in the enclave.\n\nIn January, the ICJ ordered Israel to prevent genocidal acts against Palestinians in Gaza, allow more humanitarian aid to enter and preserve evidence of violations.\n\nHowever, humanitarian organisations have repeatedly criticised Israel's aid restrictions, as famine threatens the area.\n\nIsrael has been occupying what is recognised under international law as Palestinian land since the 1967 war. East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza all fall under this category, and the separate legal systems, construction of settlements and acts of violence meted out against Palestinian residents are all key factors that will be considered in the hearings.\n\nThis is the second advisory opinion delivered by the world court since 2004, when it issued a landmark opinion on the legality of Israel's construction of a wall in occupied Palestine. The court decided that the wall, often referred to by Palestinians and rights group as the \"apartheid wall\", was illegal and should be destroyed.", "source": {"uri": "middleeasteye.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Middle East Eye"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Advisory opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Annexation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Conventions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geneva Conventions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Six-Day War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enclave and exclave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Famine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/images-story/MEE%20BREAKING%20SLIDE_0_1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745204", "eventUri": "eng-9745204", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings, but submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri": "sfgate.com",

Depending on its finding, it could mark the first time the ICJ has delivered a position on whether the 57-year occupation is illegal.\n\nIn this case, the court will issue an advisory opinion, which is not legally binding but will still carry significant political weight.\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war. It withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, retaining control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. Despite the pullout, the UN still considers Gaza as part of the occupied territories.\n\nAs the occupying power, Israel's actions in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza are subject to a detailed set of rules under international law governing occupation, designed to protect the occupied civilian population.\n\nBefore hearings started in February this year, Israel issued a statement saying it did not recognise \"the legitimacy of the discussion\" at the ICJ. It described the move, which was initiated by the State of Palestine at the UN, as \"part of the Palestinian attempt to dictate the results of the political settlement [of the Israel-Palestinian conflict] without negotiations\".\n\nIt declined to take part in the oral hearings and submitted a written statement instead. Some 52 countries presented their opinions, the vast majority asserting that the occupation was illegal and urging the ICJ to declare it as such.\n\nThe US - Israel's closest ally - called on the court \"to carefully calibrate its advice\" and refrain from issuing an opinion \"that calls for a unilateral, immediate and unconditional withdrawal by Israel that does not account for Israel's legitimate security needs\".\n\nFor its part, the Palestinian Authority's foreign minister told the court that his people had endured \"colonialism and apartheid\".\n\n\"The prolonged, continuous Israeli occupation of Palestine is intended to accomplish... the complete disappearance of Palestine and the destruction of the Palestinian people,\" he said.\n\nInternational lawyer Philippe Sands, a member of Palestinian legal team, told the BBC: \"In terms of the legal outcomes, and solution that must ultimately be found, this [ICJ case] is as significant as it gets.\"\n\nIf the ICJ does issue an advisory opinion, it then goes to the UN General Assembly, which will decide how to respond, including the option of adopting a resolution. That would be significant and could constitute a catalyst for negotiations and set the legal parameters for a future negotiated settlement.\n\nIf the court decides that Israel's occupation is illegal, it will tell all UN bodies and nations they must do nothing to support or contribute to the current situation.\n\nSuch a ruling could potentially have far-reaching trade implications, but of greatest significance would be the consequences for the legitimacy of Israel's justification for staying in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nIsrael claims sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem, which it considers its indivisible capital - something which is not accepted by the vast majority of the international community. It has also built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\n\nThe ICJ case being heard on Friday is separate from another active case brought to the court by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians in the war in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Although its rulings are difficult to implement, they add to the growing international pressure and isolation that Israel faces in the global community.\n\nIn a separate case brought by South Africa, the ICJ is considering allegations that Israel is committing genocide in its war on Gaza.\n\nA preliminary ruling has already been made in that case, with the court ordering Israel to prevent and punish incitement to genocide and to increase provisions of humanitarian aid.\n\nThe ICJ had also ordered Israel to halt its offensive on Rafah, citing \"immense risk\" to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians taking shelter in Rafah, the southernmost part of Gaza. But Israel has continued attacks on Gaza, including Rafah, in defiance of the UN court.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israel's security concerns, the ABC News reports.\n\nIsraeli officials also said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has remained stagnant for more than a decade.\n\nIn response to the ruling, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the West Bank and East Jerusalem were part of the Jewish people's historical \"homeland.\"\n\n\"The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land - not in our eternal capital Jerusalem and not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" he said in a post on the social media platform X. \"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\"\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war.

Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\"\n\nIsrael boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated, according to ABC News.\n\nIsrael said the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group, Peace Now.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe 15-judge panel said Israel's \"abuse of its status as the occupying power\" renders its \"presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful.\" It says its continued presence was \"illegal\" and should be ended as \"rapidly as possible.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt said Israel must end settlement construction immediately and that existing settlements must be removed, according to the 83-page opinion read out by court President Nawaf Salam.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has stagnant for more than a decade.\n\nIn response to the ruling, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the West Bank and east Jerusalem were part of the Jewish people's historical \"homeland.\"\n\n\"The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land - not in our eternal capital Jerusalem and not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" he said in a post on the social media platform X. \"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\"\n\nThe court's opinion, sought by the U.N. General Assembly after a Palestinian request, is unlikely to effect Israel's policy. But its resounding breadth -- including saying Israel could not claim sovereignty in the territories and was impeding Palestinians' right to self-determination -- could impact international opinion.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt came against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nNetanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com",

General Assembly.\n\nWhile advisory opinions of judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) are non-binding, they carry weight under international law and a clear finding that the occupation is illegal could weaken support for Israel.\n\nThe advisory opinion process predates the current Israel-Hamas conflict, and in a separate case brought by South Africa, the court in May issued a binding order for Israel to halt its Rafah offensive in the Gaza Strip. Israel strongly condemned the ruling.\n\nIn late 2022 the General Assembly asked the court to appraise Israel's \"prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation\" of Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, and associated Israeli government policies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem - areas of historic Palestine which the Palestinians want for a state - in the 1967 war and has since built settlements in the West Bank and steadily expanded them.\n\nIsraeli leaders have argued the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard it as Israeli-occupied territory.\n\nIn February, more than 50 states presented their views before the court, with Palestinian representatives asking the court to find that Israel must withdraw from all the occupied areas and dismantle illegal settlements.\n\nIsrael did not participate in the hearings but filed a written statement telling the court that issuing an advisory opinion would be \"harmful\" to attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe majority of states participating asked the court to find the occupation illegal, while a handful, including Canada and Britain, argued it should refuse to give an advisory opinion.\n\nThe United States, Israel's strongest backer, urged the court to limit any advisory opinion and not order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories.\n\nThe 15-judge panel will start reading out their opinion at 3 p.m. local time (1300 GMT).\n\nIn 2004 the ICJ gave an advisory ruling that an Israeli separation barrier around most of the West Bank was \"contrary to international law\" and Israeli settlements were established in breach of international law. Israel dismissed the ruling.\n\nReporting by Stephanie van den Berg; Editing by Ros Russell\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com",

The Court notes with grave concern reports that Israel's settlement policy has been expanding since the Court's Wall Advisory Opinion.\"\n\nThe hearing comes against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which had been triggered by Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a separate case, the International Court of Justice is currently considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide. Israel has vehemently denied this claim.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognised, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007.\n\nThe international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt earlier hearings in February, the then-foreign minister for Palestine, Riad Malki, accused Israel of apartheid and urged the UN's top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally. He said that this was necessary for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael did not send a legal team to the hearings, instead submitting written comments saying that questions to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognise Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens\".\n\nIt also said that the questions to the court failed to address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including the \"permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders\".\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organisations.", "source": {"uri": "thejournal.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheJournal.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@thejournal.ie", "name": "Press Association", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Geneva_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fourth Geneva Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_dispute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Territorial dispute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annexation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6441328/listing?version=6441342&width=590", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745204", "eventUri": "eng-9745204", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

They warned a prolonged occupation posed an \"extreme danger\" to stability in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nBut the United States said Israel should not be legally obliged to withdraw without taking its \"very real security needs\" into account.\n\nIsrael did not take part in the oral hearings.\n\nInstead, it submitted a written contribution in which it described the questions the court had been asked as \"prejudicial\" and \"tendentious\".\n\n- 'Ongoing violation' -\n\nThe General Assembly asked the ICJ to consider two questions.\n\nFirstly, the court should examine the legal consequences of what the UN called \"the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\".\n\nThis relates to the \"prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967\" and \"measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem\".\n\nIn June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank including east Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt.\n\nIsrael then began to settle the 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) of seized Arab territory.\n\nThe UN later declared the occupation of Palestinian territory illegal, and Cairo regained Sinai under its 1979 peace deal with Israel.\n\n- Non-binding opinion -\n\nThe ICJ was also asked to look into the consequences of what it described as Israel's \"adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures\".\n\nSecondly, the ICJ was asked to advise on how Israel's actions \"affect the legal status of the occupation\" and what are the consequences for the UN and other countries.\n\nThe ICJ rules in disputes between states. Normally, its judgements are binding but it has few means to enforce them.\n\nIn this case however, the opinion is non-binding, although most advisory opinions are in fact acted upon.\n\nThe ICJ has previously issued advisory opinions on the legality of Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia and apartheid South Africa's occupation of Namibia.\n\nIt also handed down an opinion in 2004 declaring that parts of the wall erected by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down.\n\nIsrael has not complied with the ICJ ruling, and has resisted calls to route the barrier along the Green Line, the 1949 Armistice Line established after the end of fighting that accompanied Israel's establishment a year earlier.\n\njhe/jj", "source": {"uri":

But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has stagnant for more than a decade.\n\nIn response to the ruling, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the West Bank and east Jerusalem were part of the Jewish people's historical \"homeland.\"\n\n\"The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land - not in our eternal capital Jerusalem and not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" he said in a post on the social media platform X.\n\n\"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\"\n\nThe court's opinion, sought by the UN General Assembly after a Palestinian request, is unlikely to effect Israel's policy. But its resounding breadth -- including saying Israel could not claim sovereignty in the territories and was impeding Palestinians' right to self-determination -- could impact international opinion.\n\nIt came against the backdrop of Israel's devastating 10-month military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognised, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007.

It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings, but submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com",

This advisory opinion, issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ), marks the court's strongest stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict to date.\n\nThe ICJ's ruling, though not legally binding, holds significant weight under international law and could potentially erode support for Israel. \"Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law,\" stated ICJ President Nawaf Salam, summarizing the findings of the 15-judge panel.\n\nThe court outlined that Israel's responsibilities include paying restitution for damages and evacuating all settlers from the existing settlements. In response, Israel's foreign ministry dismissed the opinion as \"fundamentally wrong\" and biased, reiterating its belief that a political resolution can only be achieved through negotiations.\n\n\"The Jewish nation cannot be an occupier in its own land,\" declared Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. The ICJ's opinion sparked outrage among West Bank settlers and politicians like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who advocates for the formal annexation of the West Bank.\n\nIsrael Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, one of the largest settler councils, criticized the ICJ opinion as being \"contrary to the Bible, morality, and international law.\"\n\nThe ICJ also asserted that the U.N. Security Council, the General Assembly, and all states have a duty not to recognize the occupation as legal nor \"render aid or assistance\" to maintain Israel's presence in the occupied territories. The United States, Israel's largest military ally, faces pressure as the Palestinian Authority's role diminishes in the West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinian Foreign Ministry hailed the opinion as \"historic,\" urging nations to comply with it. \"No aid. No assistance. No complicity. No money, no arms, no trade... no actions of any kind to support Israel's illegal occupation,\" stated Palestinian envoy Riyad al-Maliki outside the court.\n\nThis case originated from a 2022 U.N. General Assembly request for a legal opinion, predating the October Gaza conflict. Israel seized the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East war and has since expanded settlements in the West Bank. While Israeli leaders claim these territories are not legally occupied due to their disputed status, the United Nations and most of the global community view them as occupied territory.\n\nIn February, over 50 states presented their views to the ICJ. Palestinian representatives urged the court to mandate Israel's withdrawal from all occupied areas and dismantle illegal settlements. Israel, though absent from the oral hearings, submitted a written statement cautioning that an advisory opinion would hinder conflict resolution efforts.\n\nThe majority of participating states supported the court's finding of the occupation's illegality. However, countries like Canada and Britain opposed the issuance of an advisory opinion. The United States advocated against an unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces, stressing the need for negotiations towards a two-state solution based on a \"land for peace\" principle.\n\nIn 2004, the ICJ ruled that an Israeli separation barrier around most of the West Bank was illegal and that Israeli settlements breached international law. Israel dismissed that ruling.", "source": {"uri": "thezimbabwemail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Zimbabwe Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In the resolution, the UN General Assembly requested an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on \"Israeli practices affecting the human rights of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.\" The ICJ, also known as the World Court, is the UN's principal judicial organ that adjudicates disputes between member states and provides advisory opinions on international legal matters.\n\nThis case is separate from the one brought forth by South Africa last year, in which the ICJ provisionally ruled that Israeli practices in Gaza are plausibly genocidal. Following that ruling, Israel indicated that it rejects the ICJ's findings. In a post on X, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote, \"Nobody will stop us - not The Hague, not the axis of evil and not anybody else.\"\n\nPublic hearings on Israel's occupation of Palestine were held at The Hague on February 19 and lasted for six days, during which 52 countries participated and presented arguments. The panel of 15 judges on the court was asked by the UN General Assembly to consider \"the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\"\n\nThe hearings commenced with remarks by Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki, in which he asserted the rights of Palestinians to live \"in freedom and dignity in their ancestral land.\" He asked the ICJ to recognize the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and called on the court to \"declare Israel occupation is illegal and must end it completely and unconditionally.\"\n\nIsrael did not participate in the oral arguments, but the Office of the Prime Minister issued a statement saying, \"Israel does not recognize the legitimacy of the discussion at the International Court of Justice in The Hague regarding the 'legality of the occupation' -- a move designed to harm Israel's right to defend itself against existential threats.\"\n\nIsrael was born of British colonialism; it was created through a mixture of state violence and vigilante terrorist acts that displaced Palestinians and dispossessed them from their homes and land; it is supported -- financially, militarily and diplomatically -- by Western, primarily U.S., imperialism-serving war profiteers; and it is sustained by a combination of state-sanctioned violence and a system of apartheid that denies Palestinians -- who form half the people in the land under Israeli control from the river to the sea -- their equal rights.\n\nAfter the Nakba of 1948, the State of Israel was established on 78 percent of the land of what had been British Mandate Palestine. During the June 1967 war, Israel took over the West Bank, Gaza and Arab East Jerusalem, the remaining 22 percent of historic Palestine, now known as \"the Occupied Territories.\" In 1980, Israel unilaterally formalized its annexation of East Jerusalem -- a move that was condemned as illegal by the international community.\n\nOver the past 57 years, successive Israeli governments have brutally terrorized Palestinians, demolished homes, confiscated large tracts of Palestinian lands, expanded Israeli settlements in the West Bank -- considered illegal under international law -- and added many new ones that effectively rendered the \"two-state solution\" impossible. Now West Bank settlers number more than 700,000; they are heavily armed and are constantly terrorizing Palestinian residents in neighboring villages in an effort to force them to leave, as described in a report by Amnesty International.\n\nAccording to the Palestinian Health Ministry, since October 7,575 Palestinians -- of whom 138 are children -- were killed in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem by soldiers and armed settlers.\n\nIsrael employs oppression, violence, persecution, checkpoints, house demolitions, displacement, expulsion, imprisonment, land theft, torture of children and collective punishment to ethnically cleanse non-Jewish inhabitants.\n\nRacism in Israel is not a flaw in the system; it is the system. International human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have issued extensive reports that concluded that Israel practices apartheid. United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory Francesca Albanese has come under vicious attacks following her report highlighting Israeli settler colonialism and apartheid. Hagai El-Ad, director of B'Tselem, Israel's oldest human rights organization, recently said in a report, \"Israel is not a democracy that has a temporary occupation attached to it: It is one regime between the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, and we must look at the full picture and see it for what it is: apartheid.\"\n\nUnlike the framing commonly put forth by politicians and mainstream media, it is not \"complicated.\" It is not \"an age-old religious feud.\" And, it is not \"a conflict by extremists on both sides.\"\n\nAt a public sitting at the Peace Palace in The Hague, Judge Nawaf Salam, president of the World Court, read the ICJ's advisory opinion regarding Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories.\n\nThe panel of judges concluded by 14 votes to 1 that the ICJ has jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested by the UN General Assembly. By 11 votes to 4, the court is of the opinion that \"the State of Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful\" and that \"Israel is under an obligation to bring to an end its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible. \"\n\nWith only a single \"no\" vote by Judge Julia Sebutinde of Uganda, the remaining 14 judges on the panel agreed that Israel's settlement policies are in breach of international law and that \"the State of Israel is under an obligation to cease immediately all new settlement activities, and to evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\" Also, by 14 votes to 1, the court agreed that \"Israel has the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural and or legal persons concerned in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\"\n\nBy 12 votes to 3, the ICJ is of the opinion:\n\nToday's highly significant opinion by the ICJ will have far-reaching effects -- despite the fact that it is considered as advisory and nonbinding. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was quick to blast the opinion, releasing a July 19 statement saying: \"The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land -- not in our eternal capital Jerusalem, nor in our ancestral heritage of Judea and Samaria\" (a reference to the occupied West Bank), and adding, \"No decision of lies in The Hague will distort this historical truth, and similarly, the legality of Israeli settlements in all parts of our homeland cannot be disputed.\"\n\nIsraeli politicians' eagerness to assure their public and the world that the World Court's decision will be ignored comes as no surprise given how they reacted in May to the International Court of Justice when it ordered an end to Israel's military offensive on Rafah as part of the broader genocide case.\n\nThe ICJ's order relating to Israel's Rafah offensive required Israel, \"in conformity with its obligations\" under the Genocide Convention, to \"immediately halt its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\" The court also ordered Israel to open the Rafah crossing and allow aid trucks of food, water and medical supplies to reach displaced Palestinians. It also required that Israel provide access for investigators and report back on its progress within one month.\n\nBut as we have seen, Israel complied with none of the above. Instead, it went ahead with its military offensive on Rafah and has further intensified its assault on Gaza City and northern Gaza. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel killed 309 Palestinians and wounded 640 across Gaza since July 11, raising the death toll to 38,794 and the number of wounded to 88,881 in the Gaza Strip. Among the dead, 28,428 have been fully identified. These include 7,779 children, 5,466 women and 2,418 elderly people. In addition, around 10,000 more are estimated to be under the rubble.\n\nThe Lancet, a respected British medical journal, calculated that the real death toll, including those missing under the rubble and \"indirect\" deaths from malnutrition, disease, and other conditions brought on by the conflict, could be around 186,000 people -- roughly 8 percent of Gaza's population. Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives just passed a bill to ban the State Department from accurately sharing the death toll in Palestine.\n\nGaza has been pulverized. Gaza today is thirsty; Gaza today is hungry; Gaza today is bleeding and is crying for help -- for a ceasefire and an end to the suffering of its people. Nearly 80 percent of the Palestinians in Gaza have been forced from their homes and a colossal humanitarian crisis has taken hold, including, per the United Nations, a full-blown famine. The United Nations experts warned that the number of deaths of Palestinian children due to hunger and malnutrition leaves no doubt that famine has spread across the entire Gaza Strip.\n\nToday's damning ICJ opinion is in line with what two-thirds of all UN member states agree on. As of June 2024, the State of Palestine is recognized as a sovereign state by 146 of the 193 member states of the United Nations, or over 75 percent of all UN member states. Spain, Ireland, Norway and Slovenia most recently recognized the State of Palestine.\n\nBy going to the ICJ, the internationally recognized State of Palestine is calling upon all countries of the world to genuinely support democracy and equal rights for Palestinians to achieve a peace that would be in the best interest of Palestinians and Israelis alike.\n\nDespite numerous UN Security Council resolutions, the Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected the establishment of an independent State of Palestine in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. The current extremist, right-wing Israeli leaders of the settlement movement such as Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have openly called for ethnic cleansing of the West Bank and Gaza to create a Greater Israel from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIn anticipation of the ICJ opinion, the Israeli parliament passed a resolution on July 18 -- the day before the ICJ announced its advisory opinion -- affirming its opposition to Palestinian statehood. The resolution, which was opposed only by the nine Arab members of the Israeli Knesset, states that \"the establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the Land of Israel would constitute an existential threat to the State of Israel and its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilize the region.\"\n\nIn a Haaretz article on July 18, far right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich of the Religious Zionist Party was quoted as saying in a post on X: \"With a decisive majority of 68 to 9, the Knesset voted against the establishment of an Arab terror state in Israel, not now, not in the future, not unilaterally, and not within an agreement.\" Referring to the annexation of the West Bank, he added: \"The awakening of the overwhelming majority in Israeli society is amazing. Now is the time for sovereignty.\"\n\nWhile the Biden administration continues its insincere rhetorical support for the two-state solution, the U.S. has remained Israel's staunchest supporter, always using its veto power to shield it from accountability and prevent Palestinian statehood despite Israel's repeated violations of international law and UN Security Council resolutions.\n\nThe Palestinian people have faced a long history of injustice -- from colonialism to displacement to present-day apartheid. The countries of the Global South recognize that the unimaginable suffering being inflicted every minute of every day on the Palestinian people must come to an end. Time will tell if the ICJ's opinion will produce a change in the policies of Western governments and succeed in finally allowing Palestinians to return to their homes and live their lives with freedom, equality and dignity.", "source": {"uri": "truthout.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Truthout"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michel_moushabeck@truthout.org", "name": "Michel Moushabeck", "type":

It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it could also increase the number of countries that recognise the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law\".\n\nIsrael boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe UN General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighbourhoods of its capital.\n\nPalestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters.\n\nMr Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Mr Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalise outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometres (nearly five square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nData from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source":

They warned a prolonged occupation posed an \"extreme danger\" to stability in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nBut the United States said Israel should not be legally obliged to withdraw without taking its \"very real security needs\" into account.\n\nIsrael did not take part in the oral hearings.\n\nInstead, it submitted a written contribution in which it described the questions the court had been asked as \"prejudicial\" and \"tendentious\".\n\n'ONGOING VIOLATION'\n\nThe General Assembly asked the ICJ to consider two questions.\n\nFirstly, the court should examine the legal consequences of what the UN called \"the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\".\n\nThis relates to the \"prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967\" and \"measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem\".\n\nIn June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank including east Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt.\n\nIsrael then began to settle the 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) of seized Arab territory.\n\nThe UN later declared the occupation of Palestinian territory illegal, and Cairo regained Sinai under its 1979 peace deal with Israel.\n\nNON-BINDING OPINION\n\nThe ICJ was also asked to look into the consequences of what it described as Israel's \"adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures\".\n\nSecondly, the ICJ was asked to advise on how Israel's actions \"affect the legal status of the occupation\" and what are the consequences for the UN and other countries.\n\nThe ICJ rules in disputes between states. Normally, its judgements are binding but it has few means to enforce them.\n\nIn this case however, the opinion is non-binding, although most advisory opinions are in fact acted upon.\n\nThe ICJ has previously issued advisory opinions on the legality of Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia and apartheid South Africa's occupation of Namibia.\n\nIt also handed down an opinion in 2004 declaring that parts of the wall erected by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down.\n\nIsrael has not complied with the ICJ ruling, and has resisted calls to route the barrier along the Green Line, the 1949 Armistice Line established after the end of fighting that accompanied Israel's establishment a year earlier.", "source": {"uri": "ewn.co.za",

According to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, at least and 80% of the population displaced in , where over 100 hostages are believed to remain.\n\nThe ICJ is expected to rule on the UN General Assembly's questions regarding the legal consequences of Israel's \"continuing violation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\" and \"its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\"\n\nThe ICJ has also been asked to assess how \"the policies and practices of Israel [...] affect the legal status of the occupation,\" as well as the consequences for \"all States and the United Nations.\" The resolution adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 2022 that requested an advisory opinion from the ICJ mentions East Jerusalem, and also the \"living conditions of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nThere are a total of 700,000 Israeli settlers in the Wet Bank and East Jerusalem, according to the German dpa news agency. In Resolution 2334 of 2016, the UN Security Council stated that \"Israel's establishment of settlements in Palestinian territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem, had no legal validity, constituting a flagrant violation under international law.\" It also reiterated its demand that \"Israel immediately and completely cease all settlement activities\" in occupied territory.\n\nThe ICJ has also been requested to examine the situation in East Jerusalem, which Israel occupied in the Six-Day War of 1967. The area includes Jerusalem's Old City, which is home to many holy sites that have significance for Islam, and Christianity. In 1980, Israel passed the Jerusalem Law declaring the \"complete and united\" city to be the capital of Israel. The UN Security Council declared the law null and void. Few states recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and many international embassies are located in the city of Tel Aviv. The Palestinian Authority has proclaimed East Jerusalem as\n\nof the Palestinian territories, 49 UN member states and three international organizations were presented. EU states such as France and Spain also presented statements, as did the United States, Russia and China. Many called for an end to unlawful settlement activity in occupied territory.\n\ndid not attend the hearings but in an earlier written statement submitted in July 2023, it described the questions placed before the ICJ as \"tendentious\" and said that they \"represent a clear distortion of the history and present reality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\"\n\nIn February, the acting legal adviser for the US State Department, Richard Visek, told the ICJ that it should \"not find that Israel is legally obligated to immediately and unconditionally withdraw from occupied territory.\"\n\n\"Any movement towards Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank and requires consideration of Israel's very real security needs,\" he said. \"We were all reminded of those , and they persist.\"\n\nAdvisory opinions are non-binding and the says that the \"organ, agency or organization remains free to decide, as it sees fit, what effect\" to give them. But it points out that \"the Court's advisory opinions nevertheless carry great legal weight and moral authority. to give to these opinions.\"\n\nIn this case, the ICJ's advisory opinion could increase political pressure on Israel with regard to its war against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nStefan Talmon, a professor of international law at the University of Bonn, told DW in a written statement that the ICJ's opinion could have \"far-reaching consequences.\" If it were to find that Israel's occupation, settlement and de-facto annexation of territories were illegal, states that are committed to international law, such as Germany and other EU states,\n\nHe added that were this to happen, it could have a \"considerably explosive impact,\" and Israel's international position, both legally and politically, could be weakened.\n\nHe also explained that the case could have an impact on national courts as well as the , if it meant that East Jerusalem or other occupied territories could no longer be incorporated in trade agreements between the and Israel, for example.\n\nThe ICJ is currently also deliberating a separate case brought forth by South Africa in December 2023, accusing Israel of genocide in light of its military campaign in Gaza. In January, the court delivered an interim judgement, ruling that the case was \"plausible\" and emphasized that there was risk of \"irreparable harm to the Palestinian right to be protected from genocide.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognised, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007.\n\nThe international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian foreign minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings, but submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognise Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens\", address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders\".\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organisations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view\".\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it could also increase the number of countries that recognise the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law\".\n\nIsrael boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe UN General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighbourhoods of its capital.\n\nPalestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters.\n\nMr Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Mr Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalise outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometres (nearly five square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nData from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source":

In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings, but submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Palestinian territory 'illegal'", "body": "NEW YORK (Agencies): Israel's decades-long occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and needs to end \"as rapidly as possible\", the UN's top court said Friday.\n\n\"The court has found that Israel's continued presence in the Palestinian Territories is illegal,\" International Court of Justice presiding judge Nawaf Salam said, adding: \"Israel must end the occupation as rapidly as possible.\"\n\nPolicies and practices used by Israel in its occupation of Palestinian territories are in breach of international law, the United Nations' top court said in its landmark opinion.\n\nThe court said Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as \"the regime associated with them\" were established and are being maintained in violation of international law.\n\nIt further said that Israel systematically discriminates against Palestinians in the occupied territories and branded the occupation of the territories \"de facto annexation,\" and that Israel's exploitation of natural resources in the Palestinian territories likewise violates international law.\n\nIsrael's \"unlawful policies and practices\" were \"in breach of Israel's obligation to respect the right of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination,\" the court said.\n\nThe International Court of Justice, which is based at The Hague in the Netherlands, had been looking into the legal consequences of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories following a request from the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nThe assembly had asked the court in January 2023, prior to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks and the start of the war in Gaza, to deliver an opinion on Israeli \"policies and practices\" toward Palestinians and on the legal status of the occupation of Palestinian territories, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.\n\nThe court's advisory opinion is not legally binding, but it could have a significant political impact as Israel faces mounting backlash and isolation over its deadly offensive in Gaza, where nearly 39,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed since the war began, according to local health officials.", "source": {"uri": "thefrontierpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Frontier Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nAlso Read | Russia: Helicopter With 4 on Board Goes Missing in Yakutia, Search and Rescue Efforts On.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognised, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings. But it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognise Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens\", address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders\".\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organisations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view\".\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project\".\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognise the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe UN General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15 per cent in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighbourhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalise outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.

They declared, \"Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful.\" The court urged that Israel's ongoing presence should be terminated \"as rapidly as possible,\" reported AP. \"The State of Israel is under the obligation to bring an end to its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible,\" said the presiding judge Nawaf Salam.\n\nIsrael, which generally views the United Nations and international tribunals as 'biased', did not send legal representatives to the hearings. However, it submitted written statements claiming the issues presented to the court were prejudiced and neglected Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have argued that the court's involvement could disrupt the peace process, stalled for over a decade.\n\nCourt President Nawaf Salam said, \"the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as Israel's maintenance of their presence, is contrary to article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention.\" The court also voiced \"grave concern\" over Israel's expanding settlement policy. Furthermore, they determined that Israel's management of natural resources was \"inconsistent\" with its obligations under international law as an occupying power.\n\nThis ruling was issued amidst Israel's ongoing 10-month military operation in Gaza, provoked by attacks from Hamas in southern Israel.

The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognised, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings, but submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com",

They warned a prolonged occupation posed an \"extreme danger\" to stability in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nBut the United States said Israel should not be legally obliged to withdraw without taking its \"very real security needs\" into account.\n\nIsrael did not take part in the oral hearings.\n\nInstead, it submitted a written contribution in which it described the questions the court had been asked as \"prejudicial\" and \"tendentious\".\n\n- 'Ongoing violation' -\n\nThe General Assembly asked the ICJ to consider two questions.\n\nMore from this section Woods determined to fight on despite worst ever British Open Turkey: Nearby Wildfire Prompts Temporary Closure Of Izmir Adnan Menderes Airport National debt surpasses $34.9 trillion for first time in history\n\nFirstly, the court should examine the legal consequences of what the UN called \"the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\".\n\nThis relates to the \"prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967\" and \"measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem\".\n\nIn June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank including east Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt.\n\nIsrael then began to settle the 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) of seized Arab territory.\n\nThe UN later declared the occupation of Palestinian territory illegal, and Cairo regained Sinai under its 1979 peace deal with Israel.\n\n- Non-binding opinion -\n\nThe ICJ was also asked to look into the consequences of what it described as Israel's \"adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures\".\n\nSecondly, the ICJ was asked to advise on how Israel's actions \"affect the legal status of the occupation\" and what are the consequences for the UN and other countries.\n\nThe ICJ rules in disputes between states. Normally, its judgements are binding but it has few means to enforce them.\n\nIn this case however, the opinion is non-binding, although most advisory opinions are in fact acted upon.\n\nThe ICJ has previously issued advisory opinions on the legality of Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia and apartheid South Africa's occupation of Namibia.\n\nIt also handed down an opinion in 2004 declaring that parts of the wall erected by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down.\n\nIsrael has not complied with the ICJ ruling, and has resisted calls to route the barrier along the Green Line, the 1949 Armistice Line established after the end of fighting that accompanied Israel's establishment a year earlier.\n\njhe/jj", "source": {"uri":

They warned a prolonged occupation posed an \"extreme danger\" to stability in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nBut the United States said Israel should not be legally obliged to withdraw without taking its \"very real security needs\" into account.\n\nIsrael did not take part in the oral hearings.\n\nInstead, it submitted a written contribution in which it described the questions the court had been asked as \"prejudicial\" and \"tendentious\".\n\n- 'Ongoing violation' -\n\nThe General Assembly asked the ICJ to consider two questions.\n\nFirstly, the court should examine the legal consequences of what the UN called \"the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\".\n\nThis relates to the \"prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967\" and \"measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem\".\n\nIn June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank including east Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt.\n\nIsrael then began to settle the 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) of seized Arab territory.\n\nThe UN later declared the occupation of Palestinian territory illegal, and Cairo regained Sinai under its 1979 peace deal with Israel.\n\n- Non-binding opinion -\n\nThe ICJ was also asked to look into the consequences of what it described as Israel's \"adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures\".\n\nSecondly, the ICJ was asked to advise on how Israel's actions \"affect the legal status of the occupation\" and what are the consequences for the UN and other countries.\n\nThe ICJ rules in disputes between states. Normally, its judgements are binding but it has few means to enforce them.\n\nIn this case however, the opinion is non-binding, although most advisory opinions are in fact acted upon.\n\nThe ICJ has previously issued advisory opinions on the legality of Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia and apartheid South Africa's occupation of Namibia.\n\nIt also handed down an opinion in 2004 declaring that parts of the wall erected by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down.\n\nIsrael has not complied with the ICJ ruling, and has resisted calls to route the barrier along the Green Line, the 1949 Armistice Line established after the end of fighting that accompanied Israel's establishment a year earlier.\n\njhe/jj\n\nMore from this

The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nThe international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian foreign minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings, but submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognise Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens\", address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders\".\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organisations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view\".\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it could also increase the number of countries that recognise the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law\".\n\nIsrael boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe UN General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighbourhoods of its capital.\n\nPalestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters.\n\nMr Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Mr Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalise outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometres (nearly five square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nData from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source":

It launched its devastating campaign to destroy Hamas after the Palestinian militant group mounted a surprise attack against Israel, killing around 1,200 people according to Israel. The war in Gaza has killed more than 38,000 people, according to Gaza's health ministry.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank - together with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip - in the 1967 war against its Arab neighbors. Since then, Israeli settlers - who call the area Judea and Samaria - have built communities in the region which the international community has long deemed illegal.\n\nSettlements in the Gaza Strip were dismantled in 2005, when Israel withdrew from the southern coastal enclave. Two years later Hamas, an Islamist group, took control of the territory in a brief civil war with its secular rivals Fatah. Israel imposed restrictions on goods entering the area, a blockade that tightened even further during its military campaign after the October 7 attack by Hamas.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, which runs parts of the occupied West Bank, wants to build an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. The current Israeli administration rejects calls for an independent Palestinian state.\n\nWhile war rages in Gaza, violence has also increased in the West Bank, where Israeli forces have carried out increasing raids on Palestinian militant groups, and where settlers have stepped up their own attacks on Palestinians.\n\nThe ICJ opinion delivered on Friday predates the current war in Gaza was drawn up after a request was made by the UN General Assembly before the current conflict on Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "weku.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "weku.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It launched its devastating campaign to destroy Hamas after the Palestinian militant group mounted a surprise attack against Israel, killing around 1,200 people according to Israel. The war in Gaza has killed more than 38,000 people, according to Gaza's health ministry.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank - together with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip - in the 1967 war against its Arab neighbors. Since then, Israeli settlers - who call the area Judea and Samaria - have built communities in the region which the international community has long deemed illegal.\n\nSettlements in the Gaza Strip were dismantled in 2005, when Israel withdrew from the southern coastal enclave. Two years later Hamas, an Islamist group, took control of the territory in a brief civil war with its secular rivals Fatah. Israel imposed restrictions on goods entering the area, a blockade that tightened even further during its military campaign after the October 7 attack by Hamas.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, which runs parts of the occupied West Bank, wants to build an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. The current Israeli administration rejects calls for an independent Palestinian state.\n\nWhile war rages in Gaza, violence has also increased in the West Bank, where Israeli forces have carried out increasing raids on Palestinian militant groups, and where settlers have stepped up their own attacks on Palestinians.\n\nThe ICJ opinion delivered on Friday predates the current war in Gaza was drawn up after a request was made by the U.N. General Assembly before the current conflict on Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_hider@npr.org", "name": "James Hider", "type":

Including East Jerusalem, the figure is as high as 700,000.\n\nThis is the second legal opinion from the court on Israel's occupation policy. Twenty years ago, in July 2004, the judges had already declared that the wall built by Israel in the West Bank violated international law and must therefore be dismantled. Israel did not comply with this ruling.\n\nThe opinion presented on Friday is separate from another proceeding before the UN court.

A brutal occupation to be sure.\n\nBut it was a legal occupation, according to the letter of international law, which sets out duties and responsibilities that an occupying power must uphold in territory under its control during armed conflict.\n\nCertainly, many of the actions carried out by the Israeli government, above all the transfer of 700,000 settlers into occupied territory, are widely regarded to have been in direct defiance of international law.\n\nFriday's momentous advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague, the UN's top court, changes that.\n\nThe court has found that the entire occupation is unlawful and that Israel's settlement policy is in breach of the Geneva Convention, which states that \"the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies\".\n\nIt has found, too, that Israel's policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territories amount to annexation of large parts of these territories, and that Israel systematically discriminates against the Palestinians who live there.\n\nThe court also advises that Israel's practices and policies violate Palestinians' right to self-determination.\n\nICJ President Nawaf Salam did not mince his words, saying: \"The sustained abuse of Israel of its position as an occupying power through annexation and an assertion of permanent control over the occupied Palestinian territory and continued frustration of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination violates fundamental principles of international law and renders Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful.\"\n\nFrom now on, it is not simply Israel's conduct of the occupation that should be considered illegal. So too, in the opinion of the ICJ's judges, is the occupation itself.\n\nIt should be understood that this ICJ case is entirely separate to the other ongoing proceedings at the court concerning Israel: South Africa's complaint that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, which the court has already ruled \"plausible\".\n\nFriday's opinion is a response to a request from the United Nations General Assembly, filed in December 2022 and supported by 87 countries (though opposed by the US, the UK, Germany and Israel, among others).\n\nThe UN General Assembly asked the court whether the military occupation of Israel should still be considered temporary (and therefore legal) in light of the fact that it has persisted for more than half a century.\n\nSubmissions to the court hearing asked the ICJ to take account of the massive expansion of settlements as well as many statements by Israeli politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, categorically ruling out a Palestinian state while describing the West Bank as part of a greater Israel.\n\nThe court has agreed - and come to the view that Israel has been running a permanent occupation in the West Bank. It has accepted that Israel has, in effect, annexed the West Bank.\n\nIt should be stressed that the ICJ has issued nothing more powerful than a non-binding opinion that does not in itself place any obligation on Israel to withdraw from the West Bank.\n\nBut the consequences are profound. For decades successive Israeli governments have abused the technical legality of the occupation to expand the grip of the Israeli state, stealing land from Palestinians, and building illegal settlements for Israeli citizens.\n\nTo quote last February's despairing submission to the court from Riyad al-Maliki, Palestinian foreign minister, Israel \"from the first day of its occupation, started colonising and annexing the land with the aim of making its occupation irreversible. It left us with a collection of disconnected Bantustans.\"\n\nThe ICJ's verdict is important because it strips away the legal ambiguities and ingenious bureaucratic subterfuges that have enabled the Israeli occupation.\n\nAnd it comes at the precise moment when, under the shadow of the Gaza war, Israel has in any case pushed forward with completing the de facto annexation of the West Bank, abandoning the pretence that the area is under temporary military occupation.\n\nThis policy received a resounding endorsement in the early hours of Thursday morning when Israel's parliament, the Knesset, voted to reject outright a Palestinian state.\n\nThe significance of the Knesset vote is momentous. Along with the trashing of the idea of the Palestinian state goes the so-called 'two-state solution'\n\nWith 68 Knesset members voting in favour, and just nine against, the resolution enjoyed the support of Netanyahu's Likud party as well as his far-right coalition allies, Bezalel Smotrich's Religious Zionism party and Itamar Ben Gvir's Jewish Power.\n\nBut it was also backed by Benny Gantz, leader of the supposedly centrist National Unity party and a man often characterised by western policymakers as a moderate influence within Israeli politics.\n\nThe significance of the Knesset vote is momentous.\n\nAlong with the trashing of the idea of the Palestinian state goes the so-called \"two-state solution\", the hackneyed formula still beloved by many western politicians even as the reality on the ground has made it increasingly unviable.\n\nFrom now on there can be no argument that Israel has started on a path towards a goal that it has either obscured or denied for half a century since 1967: the one-state solution.\n\nOf course, one imagining of such an outcome could be a one-state solution in the sense of a single country open to all its citizens with equal rights and freedoms for all.\n\nBut Israel's current political leadership is not planning that. They want a Jewish ethnostate in which Palestinians are denied social and economic rights.\n\nThere's a word for this: apartheid. Human rights organisations including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Israel's own B'Tselem and the West Bank-based Al-Haq have already applied that term to Israel.\n\nBut western leaders have refused to follow suit. It's hard to see how they can avoid facing that reality in the light of the ICJ opinion and the Knesset vote.\n\nIn the case of South Africa, international condemnation led to sanctions and travel restrictions that left the country isolated, and eventually led to the release of Nelson Mandela and the end of the Apartheid system.\n\nThat is why this ICJ opinion poses a giant problem for western leaders who support Israel.\n\nIt leaves them open to questions about that support at a time when Israel's parliament has rejected the existence of a Palestinian state on any terms, and the highest court in the world has accused it of the illegal annexation of the West Bank.\n\nIn London and Washington, in particular, it leaves governments vulnerable to further challenges over the legality and morality of continuing to supply weapons deployed with daily deadly effect against Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThrough their actions, Israel's government, and now its parliament, have openly demonstrated their own defiance of the rule-based international order.\n\nBut the ICJ's opinion at least leaves western leaders with no remaining excuses to be in any doubt about that fact.",

Israel is \"obliged to to make reparations to all natural and legal persons in occupied Palestinian territory.\"\n\nThe court's advisory opinions are not binding but are seen to carry moral and legal weight. The UN \"remains free to decide, as it sees fit, what effect to give these opinions,\" the ICJ says.\n\nThe advisory opinion comes amid diplomatic efforts to protect civilians in Palestine as the nine-month war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza continues. Israel began a military campaign in Gaza after Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and took some 250 hostage on October 7.\n\nIsrael's offensive of Gaza has killed more than 38,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Hamas is designated as a terrorist group by the US and European Union.\n\n\"The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land - neither in our eternal capital Jerusalem nor in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a post on social media platform X.\n\n\"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be disputed,\" he said.\n\nThe United Nations had in 2022 requested the ICJ to opine on the legal consequences arising from the \"ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967.\"\n\nAs the main judicial body of the United Nations, ICJ is sometimes referred to as the 'World Court.'\n\nIsrael captured the Gaza Strip from Egyptian control and the West Bank from Jordanian control in the Middle East war in 1967. East Jerusalem was also seized from Jordan at the time and has since been considered occupied territory by Palestinians and much of the international community.\n\nIsraeli \"policies and practices are designed to maintain in place indefinitely and to create irreversible effects on the ground. Consequently, the court considered that these policies and practices amount to annexation of large parts of the occupied Palestinian territory,\" according to the tribunal's advisory opinion.\n\nIt said the state of Israel has the obligation to \"make reparation for the damage caused to all\" persons concerned in the occupied Palestinian territory. It also opined that Israel should \"cease immediately all new settlement activities\" and evacuate all settlers from the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nThe court on Friday said that it was of the view that the policies and practices contemplated by UN's general assembly's request do not include conduct by Israel in Gaza in response to the attack on October 7.\n\nThe ICJ in May had ordered Israel to immediately halt its military operations in the Rafah region of the Gaza Strip and told Israel it must open the Rafah border crossing for humanitarian assistance. South Africa has called upon the court to order Israel to end its war on Hamas in Gaza and rule that its actions constitute genocide.\n\nIn May, the International Criminal Court chief prosecutor said he's seeking arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar on war crimes charges. A panel of ICC judges will consider whether to accept the prosecutor's application.", "source": {"uri": "luxtimes.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Luxembourg Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, retaining control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. Despite the pullout, the UN still considers Gaza as part of the occupied territories.\n\nAs the occupying power, Israel's actions in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza are subject to a detailed set of rules under international law governing occupation, designed to protect the occupied civilian population.\n\nBefore hearings started in February this year, Israel issued a statement saying it did not recognise \"the legitimacy of the discussion\" at the ICJ. It described the move, which was initiated by the State of Palestine at the UN, as \"part of the Palestinian attempt to dictate the results of the political settlement [of the Israel-Palestinian conflict] without negotiations\".\n\nIt declined to take part in the oral hearings and submitted a written statement instead. Some 52 countries presented their opinions, the vast majority asserting that the occupation was illegal and urging the ICJ to declare it as such.\n\nThe US - Israel's closest ally - called on the court \"to carefully calibrate its advice\" and refrain from issuing an opinion \"that calls for a unilateral, immediate and unconditional withdrawal by Israel that does not account for Israel's legitimate security needs\".\n\nFor its part, the Palestinian Authority's foreign minister told the court that his people had endured \"colonialism and apartheid\".\n\n\"The prolonged, continuous Israeli occupation of Palestine is intended to accomplish... the complete disappearance of Palestine and the destruction of the Palestinian people,\" he said.\n\nInternational lawyer Philippe Sands, a member of Palestinian legal team, told the BBC: \"In terms of the legal outcomes, and solution that must ultimately be found, this [ICJ case] is as significant as it gets.\"\n\nIf the ICJ does issue an advisory opinion, it then goes to the UN General Assembly, which will decide how to respond, including the option of adopting a resolution. That would be significant and could constitute a catalyst for negotiations and set the legal parameters for a future negotiated settlement.\n\nIf the court decides that Israel's occupation is illegal, it will tell all UN bodies and nations they must do nothing to support or contribute to the current situation.\n\nSuch a ruling could potentially have far-reaching trade implications, but of greatest significance would be the consequences for the legitimacy of Israel's justification for staying in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nIsrael claims sovereignty over the whole of Jerusalem, which it considers its indivisible capital - something which is not accepted by the vast majority of the international community. It has also built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.\n\nThe ICJ case being heard on Friday is separate from another active case brought to the court by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians in the war in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BBC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It concluded that Israel should take steps like making reparations to affected Palestinians and evacuating settlers.\n\nThe advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) covers Israeli practices in the occupied West Bank, in East Jerusalem (which Israel claims as its own territory) and in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe opinion is non-binding and has no immediate consequences.\n\nThe ICJ previously issued an opinion in 2004 saying Israel's construction of a \"separation wall\" in the West Bank was illegal, yet the wall is still standing 20 years later.\n\nStill, the assessment from the court will likely increase pressure on Israel and its allies like the U.S. for progress in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestinians see the occupied West Bank as the heart of the future state that they and most countries believe is key to peace. But Israeli settlements, home demolitions and other policies like separating East Jerusalem -- the envisioned future Palestinian capital -- from the region have made it harder to envision Israel eventually letting it become independent.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel has long disputed that it has international responsibilities as an \"occupying power\" in Gaza despite almost fully controlling access to the territory.\n\nThe Friday opinion directly challenged that view, arguing: \"The court is of the view that Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip has not entirely released it of its obligations under the law of occupation.\"\n\nThe court's consideration of the Israeli occupation is separate from the case it is considering between South Africa and Israel, in which the former argues the latter may be committing genocide against Palestinians through its ongoing offensive in the Gaza Strip. The court has said there is a \"plausible\" risk of genocide and issued three orders requiring Israel to change its conduct to do more to shield civilians. Though those orders, known as provisional measures, are meant to be binding, Israel has largely maintained the policies the court criticized, such as limits on the provision of aid to Gaza.\n\nThe Friday opinion is also distinct from the action that another international court -- the International Criminal Court (ICC) -- is considering in relation to Israel-Palestine. The ICC's top prosecutor is seeking arrest warrants against Israel's prime minister and defense minister and leaders of the Palestinian militant faction Hamas for alleged war crimes during the Oct. 7 attack and Israel's military response in Gaza since.\n\nIsrael declined to participate in the ICJ's proceedings around the advisory opinion, though more than 50 other nations did present their views.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

says Israel's policies, practices 'amount to annexation of large parts' of occupied Palestinian territory", "body": "Israel's settlement policy in occupied Palestinian territory is in breach of 4th Geneva Convention, says top UN court\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Friday said Israel's presence in Palestine is unlawful, and its policies and practices in the West Bank and East Jerusalem \"amount to annexation of large parts\" of the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nThe top UN court presented its advisory opinion regarding legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory, upon request of the UN General Assembly in late 2022.\n\nThe opinion was read out by Nawaf Salam, president of the world court, which unanimously found that it had jurisdiction to give the advisory opinion requested.\n\nThe court listed some of the policies and practices that \"amount to annexation\" such as the expansion of settlements, the exploitation of natural resources, the proclamation of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, the comprehensive application of Israeli domestic law in East Jerusalem and its extensive application in the West Bank, entrenching Israel's control of the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nThese policies and practices are designed to \"maintain in place indefinitely ... and to create irreversible effects on the ground,\" the court said, adding that it is \"not convinced\" that extending Israeli law to the West Bank and East Jerusalem is justified.\n\nThe 15-judge panel of the court considered that \"Israel is not entitled to sovereignty over or to exercise sovereign powers in any part of the occupied Palestinian territory on account of its occupation.\"\n\n\"Nor can Israel's security concerns override the principle of the prohibition of the acquisition of territory by force,\" it added.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in 1967 and has since built illegal settlements and expanded them.\n\nIsrael's settlement policy is in breach of int'l law\n\nOn Israel's settlement policy, which included forcible evictions of protected populations, and the transfer of settlers, the court stressed the actions violate the 4th Geneva Convention.\n\nThe court noted \"with grave concern reports that Israel's settlement policy has been expanding\" since its 2004 advisory opinion.\n\nIsrael's continued presence in occupied Palestinian territory 'unlawful'\n\nThe ICJ, by 11 votes to four, said Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is \"unlawful,\" which should end \"as rapidly as possible.\"\n\nIn a vote of 14 against one, the court urged Israel to \"cease immediately all new settlement activities and to evacuate all settlers\" from the occupied Palestinian territory, and that it has the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned in the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\n\"All States are under an obligation not to recognize as legal the situation arising from the unlawful presence of the State of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by the continued presence of the State of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory,\" it suggested by 12 votes in favor and three against.\n\nWith a 12-3 vote, the ICJ reminded international organizations, including the UN, about their obligation \"not to recognize as legal the situation arising from the unlawful presence\" of Israel.\n\n\"The United Nations, and especially the General Assembly, which requested the opinion, and the Security Council, should consider the precise modalities and further action required to bring to an end as rapidly as possible the unlawful presence of the State of Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory,\" it opined with 12 votes in favor and three against it.\n\nMention to 'racial segregation, apartheid' article\n\nThe ICJ also mentioned Article 3 of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) on \"racial segregation and apartheid\" in its advisory opinion, finding Israeli legislation and measures \"constitute a breach\" of the article.\n\nThe article says: \"States Parties particularly condemn racial segregation and apartheid and undertake to prevent, prohibit and eradicate all practices of this nature in territories under their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\"This provision refers to two particularly severe forms of racial discrimination: racial segregation and apartheid,\" the court said, noting that Israel's legislation and measures impose and serve to \"maintain a near-complete separation\" in the West Bank and East Jerusalem between settler and Palestinian communities.\n\n\"Israel's legislation and measures constitute a breach of Article 3 of CERD,\" it added.\n\nThe court said Israel has an obligation to repeal all legislative measures creating or maintaining unlawful situations, including those that discriminate against Palestinians.\n\nFinally, the ICJ noted that it considers \"the realization of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, including its right to an independent and sovereign state, living side by side in peace with the State of Israel within secure and recognized borders for both states, as envisaged in resolutions of the Security Council and General Assembly, would contribute to regional stability and the security of all states in the Middle East.\"\n\nThe Palestinian presidency described the decision as \"a triumph for justice,\" and \"reaffirmation of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination, their land and their statehood\" while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu termed the non-binding opinion as \"absurd\" and the Foreign Ministry rejected it.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu

In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings, but submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri":

Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe UN General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighbourhoods of its capital.\n\nPalestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters.\n\nMr Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Mr Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalise outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometres (nearly five square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nData from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source":

Palestinians have witnessed their homes being demolished, their lands expropriated to build and expand settlements, and have faced suffocating restrictions disrupting every aspect of their daily lives, from family separation and restrictions on freedom of movement to denial of access to land, water and natural resources.\n\n\"The ICJ opinion comes at a time when Israel has been flagrantly flouting international humanitarian law on a cataclysmic scale for the past nine months, carrying out deadly and unlawful attacks during its onslaught in the occupied Gaza Strip that have claimed an unprecedented toll on civilians. It has also been escalating illegal land grabs in the occupied West Bank, and authorizing the construction of more and more settlement units in occupied and illegally annexed East Jerusalem, all but entrenching and perpetuating the unlawful occupation. Israeli authorities have also consistently failed to comply with the provisional measures ordered by the ICJ to prevent genocide in Gaza. Israel must not be allowed to trample on international law any longer.\n\n\"The international community, and in particular Israel's allies, must now take unequivocal action to ensure Israel ends its unlawful occupation, starting with the immediate halting of the expansion of Israeli settlements and reversing the annexation of Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, and dismantling its brutal system of apartheid against Palestinians. Ending the occupation is crucial in order to stop the recurrent pattern of human rights violations across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\n\"Israel must withdraw its forces from all parts of the occupied territories, including the Gaza Strip and remove all settlers from the West Bank, including from the illegally annexed East Jerusalem. Israel must also relinquish control over all aspects of Palestinians' lives, as well as ceding control of borders, natural resources, air space and territorial waters of the occupied territory. This means lifting the illegal blockade of Gaza and allowing Palestinians to travel freely between Gaza and the West Bank.\"\n\nBackground\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued its advisory opinion on the legal consequences arising from Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) and the consequences of Israel's conduct for other states following an 18-month process including public hearings where more than 50 states, including Palestine, and three international organizations participated. The long-awaited advisory opinion stated that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories is a clear violation of international law.\n\nIn July 2004, the ICJ issued a first advisory opinion finding that the construction of the separation wall inside the Occupied Palestinian Territories had to be halted because it was contrary to international law. Amnesty International had also argued that the construction of the wall violates international law and contributes to serious human rights violations.\n\nThe international community's failure to implement the recommendations of the 2004 ICJ advisory opinion has emboldened Israel's defiance of international law and reinforced its impunity.", "source": {"uri": "amnesty.org", "dataType": "news",

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has dismissed the \"false ruling,\" insisting that the West Bank is Jewish land.\n\nThe court's 15 justices agreed on Friday that \"the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as Israel's maintenance of their presence, is contrary to article 49 of the fourth Geneva Convention\".\n\nReading out the non-binding advisory opinion, ICJ President Nawaf Salam described Israel's building of settlements in the West Bank as a \"de-facto annexation\" of the territory, and stated that the Jewish state should end its \"unlawful\" presence in occupied Palestinian territory as \"rapidly as possible.\"\n\nThe ICJ has been investigating Israel's \"policies and practices\" toward the occupied Palestinian territories since early 2023, at the request of the UN General Assembly. At a series of hearings in February, the Palestinian Authority's foreign minister, Riad Malki, accused Israel of apartheid and called on the court to declare the occupation of Palestinian land illegal. Israel did not send legal representatives to the hearings.\n\nWhile Friday's ruling will inform the UN's stance on Israeli settlements, the ICJ lacks any means of enforcing the decision.\n\n\"The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land - not in our eternal capital Jerusalem, not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" Netanyahu said in a statement shortly after the verdict was read out. \"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth, just as the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested,\" he added.\n\nNetanyahu's hardline coalition partners have called for an even harsher response. Speaking to reporters last week, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that Netanyahu should formally annex the entire West Bank and East Jerusalem if the court were to rule against Israel. Smotrich also promised to step up the construction of settlements to \"thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nIsrael seized the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem during the 1967 Six-Day War. The West Bank is split into three areas, with less than a fifth of its territory under full control of the Palestinian Authority. Just over a fifth is under Israeli security control and Palestinian administrative control, while the remainder - comprising around 60% of the territory - is under full Israeli control.\n\nIt is in this latter area - designated 'Area C' under the 2000 Oslo Accords - where Israel has built most of its settlements. Under the agreements, Israel was never meant to maintain permanent control over this area. However, the Israeli government has signed off on the construction of nearly 150 settlements there since the early 2000s, and more than 450,000 settlers now live in the West Bank, according to data

It also found that the U.N. Security Council, the General Assembly and all states have an obligation not to recognise the occupation as legal and not to give aid or support toward maintaining it.\n\nThe case stems from a 2022 request from the U.N. General Assembly, predating the\n\nwar in Gaza\n\nthat began in October.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem - areas of historic Palestine which the Palestinians want for a state - in a 1967 war and has since built settlements in the West Bank and steadily expanded them.\n\nIsraeli leaders have argued the territories are not occupied in legal terms because they are on disputed lands, but the United Nations and most of the international community regard them as Israeli-occupied territory.\n\nIn February, more than 50 states presented their views before the court, with Palestinian representatives asking the court to find that Israel must withdraw from all the occupied areas and dismantle illegal settlements.\n\nIsrael did not participate in the hearings but filed a written statement telling the court that issuing an advisory opinion would be \"harmful\" to attempts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nThe majority of states participating asked the court to find the occupation illegal, while a handful, including Canada and Britain, argued it should refuse to give an advisory opinion.\n\nThe United States, Israel's strongest backer, urged the court to limit any advisory opinion and not order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories. In 2004 the ICJ gave an advisory ruling that an Israeli separation barrier around most of the West Bank was \"contrary to international law\" and Israeli settlements were established in breach of international law. Israel dismissed that ruling.

The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings, but submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel's right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel's policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" -- such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com",

In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel\u00b4s campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nAt hearings in February, then-Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations\u00b4 top court to declare that Israel\u00b4s occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings, but submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and \"fail to recognize Israel\u00b4s right and duty to protect its citizens,\" address Israeli security concerns or acknowledge Israel-Palestinian agreements to negotiate issues, including \"the permanent status of the territory, security arrangements, settlements, and borders.\"\n\nFILE - A view of the Peace Palace, which houses the International Court of Justice, or World Court, in The Hague, Netherlands, on Jan. 26, 2024. (AP Photo/Patrick Post, File)\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments in February along with 49 other nations and three international organizations.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said that if the court rules that Israel\u00b4s policies in the West Bank and east Jerusalem breach international law, that is unlikely to change Israeli policies but it would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would \"worsen the case for occupation. It removes any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\"\n\nIt would also strengthen the hand of \"those who seek to advocate against it\" - such as the grassroots Palestinian-led movement advocating boycotts, divestment and sanctions against Israel.\n\nHe said it also could increase the number of countries that recognize the state of Palestine, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland.\"\n\nIt is not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel\u00b4s West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly voted by a wide margin in December 2022 to ask the world court for the advisory opinion. Israel vehemently opposed the request that was promoted by the Palestinians. Fifty countries abstained from voting.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel\u00b4s control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\nAuthorities recently approved the appropriation of 12.7 square kilometers (nearly 5 square miles) of land in the Jordan Valley, a strategic piece of land deep inside the West Bank, according to a copy of the order obtained by The Associated Press. Data from Peace Now, the tracking group, indicate it was the largest single appropriation approved since the 1993 Oslo accords at the start of the peace process.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

Settlements have not only remained in the West Bank since the ruling, but the number of Israeli settlers living there has also risen from 250,000 in 1993 to more than 700,000 in 2023.\n\n\"These rulings mean nothing if third states and the international community fail to hold Israel accountable,\" she told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"The ICJ has ruled that Israel's occupation is unlawful and must end immediately. Third states must ensure the full and total realisation of the Palestinian people to self-determination and sanction Israel's illegal occupation, which breaches international law,\" she added.\n\nPalestinian activists in the West Bank said they cannot celebrate the ICJ's ruling when the situation across the occupied territory is worse than ever before.\n\nThey cited Israel's war in Gaza, which has killed at least 38,848 Palestinians - the vast majority of them civilians - and has rendered the enclave uninhabitable. Gaza is also witnessing an outbreak of diseases such as polio and cholera while nearly the entire population is struggling to survive food shortages brought on by Israel's siege of the enclave.\n\nIsrael's war on Gaza followed Hamas-led attacks on military outposts and communities in southern Israel on October 7, in which 1,139 people were killed and 251 taken captive.\n\nThe global attention - and shock - over Israel's war ever since has distracted attention from its settlement expansion in the West Bank, observers said.\n\n\"A year ago, a ruling like this would have been great. We all would have thought this was a great step forward,\" said Tasame Ramadan, a human rights activist from the West Bank city of Nablus. \"But right now, the priority is a permanent ceasefire [in Gaza] and an end to the occupation.\"\n\nMohamad Alwan, a Palestinian rights activist monitoring settler attacks in the West Bank, expressed a similar wariness about what the ruling will mean on the ground.\n\nHe said that while he recognises the ruling hurts Israel's image abroad, there is no way for the court to apply or enforce it.\n\nIn addition, Alwan said he is pessimistic about whether states will take action against Israel after the ruling. He cited perceived indifference to the ICJ's binding order in January, in which the court called on Israel to scale up aid and prevent further harm to civilians in Gaza after concluding that \"the rights of Palestinians were at risk\" under the Genocide Convention.\n\n\"In my opinion, this decision will have no immediate impact on the situation on the ground,\" he told Al Jazeera.\n\n\"However, in the long run, there might be an impact. The world has seen now how Israel kills people and kills children, and their views are changing about Israel and its occupation.\"\n\nPalestinian activists stressed that the ICJ's advisory ruling on Friday must be understood in the context of the Nakba, or \"Catastrophe\", of 1948 when Zionist militias expelled about 750,000 Palestinians from their lands to create the state of Israel.\n\nDiana Buttu, a Palestinian legal expert, said she wished the ICJ had referenced the Nakba to highlight the historic pattern of Israel's behaviour in the occupied territory.\n\n\"While I'm happy about the outcome of this case, I also think that this focus just on the West Bank and Gaza ignores the bigger picture of the origins of this situation and the ways in which Israel was created, which was through the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians,\" Buttu told Al Jazeera.\n\nShe criticised the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs large swaths of the West Bank and represents the Palestinian people internationally, for how the issue of Israel-Palestine is typically framed by and within the global community.\n\nShe accused the PA of having long given up advocating for stateless Palestinians to be able to exercise the right of return to their former homes and lands lost during the Nakba or calling for an end to the discrimination that Palestinian citizens of Israel face.\n\nExperts and activists have previously attributed the PA's shortcomings to the Oslo Accords, the first of which was signed in 1993 by then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and then-Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on the lawn of the White House.\n\n\"The PA a long time ago took a position that it is all about the two-state solution and ending occupation, so their entire discourse has just been about that,\" Buttu said.\n\nRamadan agreed on the importance of centring the Nakba whenever speaking about Israel's settlements expansion and its war in Gaza.\n\n\"The Nakba is where this all started. How can we not mention the cause of the issue and where this all started? This is not the right way to address an issue like this,\" she said.\n\n\"We would definitely like to see the international community recognise the Nakba, recognise all the people we lost in 1948 and to recognise the consequences of the Nakba that we are still living through today.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Friday declared that Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories violates international law and ordered Israel to end it \"as rapidly as possible\" and provide full reparations for its

land -- not in our eternal capital Jerusalem, nor in our ancestral heritage of Judea and Samaria\" (the occupied West Bank), Netanyahu said in a statement.\n\nNetanyahu also said that no decision of lies in the Hague will distort this historical truth, and similarly, the legality of Israeli settlements cannot be disputed.\n\nThe International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) found that Israel had violated Article 3.\n\nThe UN General Assembly had requested the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in late 2022 to provide an \"advisory opinion\" regarding the \"legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.\".\n\nThe judges cited a long list of actions that they claimed violated international law, including the establishment and growth of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, the utilisation of the region's natural resources, the annexation and imposition of permanent control over lands, and discriminatory measures against the Palestinian people.\n\nThe court further said that other nations were obliged not to \"render aid or assistance in maintaining\" Israel's presence in the territories, and Israel must end settlement construction immediately.\n\nIsrael-Palestine Territorial Dispute\n\nIsrael, which disputes that the law of occupation applies to Palestine, falsely claimed to have captured East Jerusalem in 1967 and turned over major parts of its authority over the West Bank from military to civilian rule in 2023.\n\nThe International Court of Justice's (ICJ) examination of the legal ramifications of Israel's occupation policies and practices began in December 2022.", "source": {"uri":

Their words undermine the entire notion of the process of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.\"\n\nBetzalel Smotrich, the hard-Right finance minister, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, also slammed the court's ruling, instead calling on the government to annex the West Bank.\n\nIsrael took control within the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza and the Golan Heights in the six-day war in 1967. It annexed the Golan Heights in 1981 but would later withdraw from Gaza in 2005, pulling out some 8,500 Jewish settlers.\n\nSome 500,000 Israelis are estimated to live across the West Bank, with some living in outposts deep in Palestinian territory.\n\nSettler violence against Palestinians has grown in recent years, in particular since the Oct 7 attacks.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk",

They warned a prolonged occupation posed an \"extreme danger\" to stability in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nBut the United States said Israel should not be legally obliged to withdraw without taking its \"very real security needs\" into account.\n\nIsrael did not take part in the oral hearings.\n\nInstead, it submitted a written contribution in which it described the questions the court had been asked as \"prejudicial\" and \"tendentious\".\n\n- 'Ongoing violation' -\n\nThe General Assembly has asked the ICJ to consider two questions.\n\nFirstly, the court should examine the legal consequences of what the UN called \"the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\".\n\nThis relates to the \"prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967\" and \"measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem\".\n\nIn June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank including east Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt.\n\nIsrael then began to settle the 70,000 square kilometres (27,000 square miles) of seized Arab territory.\n\nThe UN later declared the occupation of Palestinian territory illegal, and Cairo regained Sinai under its 1979 peace deal with Israel.\n\nThe ICJ has also been asked to look into the consequences of what it described as Israel's \"adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures\".\n\nSecondly, the ICJ should advise on how Israel's actions \"affect the legal status of the occupation\" and what are the consequences for the UN and other countries.\n\nThe ICJ rules in disputes between states. Normally, its judgements are binding although it has little means to enforce them.\n\nIn this case however, the opinion it issues will be non-binding, although most advisory opinions are in fact acted upon.\n\njhe/jj", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jan_hennop@ccenterdispatch.com", "name": "Jan Hennop",

The court's decision came after the UN General Assembly requested an advisory opinion from the body on Israel's practices in the occupied territories.\n\nThe world court held that Israel's policies and practices violated a number of international agreements including the Hague Convention of 1907, the Fourth Geneva Convention, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.\n\nThe tribunal took issue with Israel's policy of settling Israeli citizens in the West Bank, ruling that the establishment of Israeli settlements on occupied territory and the legalization of illegal \"outposts,\" settlements established against Israeli law, breaches the Fourth Geneva Convention. Article 49 of the convention states that an \"Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.\" The ICJ elaborated, \"The transfer of members of the civilian population of the occupying Power into the occupied territory is prohibited regardless of whether it results in the displacement of the local population.\"\n\nThe court also ruled that Israel's use of the Occupied Palestinian Territory's natural resources for its own benefit, the extension of Israeli law into the West Bank and East Jerusalem, the forced displacement of the Palestinian population in some areas, its failure to punish extremist settlers who attack Palestinians, and separation of settler and Palestinian communities in the West Bank all violate the country's international obligations.\n\nAdditionally, the court held that Israel's integration of East and West Jerusalem, the mention of settlements in the country's Basic Law, the development of Israeli infrastructure for the use of West Bank settlers, and the extension of Israeli law into the settlements, amounts \"to annexation of large parts of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\" This, along with Israel's \"violation of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,\" led the ICJ to conclude that Israel's presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful.\n\nAs a result, the court imposed obligations on Israel to end its occupation of Palestinian territory \"as rapidly as possible,\" to immediately cease its settlement activity, to repeal all discriminatory legislation against Palestinians, and to \"provide full reparation\" to those affected by its illegal acts. It also obligated other UN member states not to recognize Israel's occupation as legal.\n\nEleven of the court's 15 judges agreed with all findings, while court vice president Julia Sebutinde was the only judge to pen a dissent. The judge called the majority's approach \"imbalanced\" and asserted that the court improperly ignored Israeli territorial claims and the historical background to the controversy. Sebutinde aligned with Israel's argument that the questions posed by the UN General Assembly's request for an advisory opinion \"present a clear distortion of the history and present reality of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\" The judge claimed that the court should have considered the Jewish connection to the territory and examined historical attempts at creating a two-state solution before rendering an advisory opinion on the issue, concluding, \"the Court should have been careful to guard its judicial character and integrity by ensuring that the nuanced and more complex issues that require resolution through negotiation, are left to the negotiation framework.\"\n\nWhile the Palestinian Foreign Ministry lauded the ICJ's opinion as a \"watershed moment for Palestine and the international law-based order,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attacked the court's decision:", "source": {"uri": "jurist.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "JURIST"}, "authors": [{"uri":

According to South Africa's application, Israel's actions in Gaza were \"genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group.\"\n\nThe ICJ's final ruling on the broader South African case may take months if not years to rule, but the court can order urgent measures while weighing its decision.\n\nIn January, the ICJ, whose orders are legally binding but lack direct enforcement mechanisms, issued an interim ruling, ordering the occupying regime to take all measures to prevent genocide in Gaza, but stopped short of ordering a ceasefire.\n\nIn May, the court ordered Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah after South Africa asked the ICJ to order a halt to the war in Gaza, and in the refugee-packed city in particular.\n\nWhile Israel ignored the ruling, the Friday opinion could add political pressure over Israel's nine-month-old war against Gaza.\n\nIsrael launched the war on Gaza on October 7 after the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas waged the surprise Operation Al-Aqsa Storm against the occupying entity in response to the Israeli regime's decades-long campaign of bloodletting and devastation against Palestinians.\n\nSince the start of the offensive, the Tel Aviv regime has killed at least 38,848 Palestinians and injured 89,459 more. Thousands more are also missing and presumed dead under rubble.\n\nMNA/", "source": {"uri": "en.mehrnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mehr News Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

No absurd opinion in the Hague can deny this historical truth or the legal right of Israelis to live in their own communities in our ancestoral home,\" he wrote on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe court's decision comes amid a 10-month conflict between Israel and Hamas, which has killed over 34,000 Palestinians, displaced upward of 2 million, and flattened large swathes of Gaza, according to The Associated Press. Israel's continued military offensives are in response to Hamas' October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, in which around 250 hostages were taken and 1,200 people killed.\n\nThe court's ruling was prompted by a U.N. General Assembly vote in December 2022 requesting its opinion.\n\nIsrael's \"Unlawful\" Presence in the Palestinian territories\n\nThe court, with 11 votes in favor and 4 against, found that \"the State of Israel is under an obligation to bring to an end its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible.\"\n\nIt also determined that the \"Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law,\" rendering Israel's presence \"illegal.\"\n\nCessation of New Settlements and Evacuation of Settlers\n\nThe court, in a near unanimous vote, 14 to 1, called for the immediate cessation of new settlement constructions and to \"evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\"\n\nIn a March report by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) it was noted that approximately 700,000 Israeli settlers lived in the West Bank as of September 2023 and \"the size of existing Israeli settlements has expanded at the highest rate since monitoring began in 2017.\"\n\nIn relation to the report, OHCHR Chief, Volker Turk, said new settlements \"fly in the face of international law\" and \"settler violence and settlement-related violations have reached shocking new levels, and risk eliminating any practical possibility of establishing a viable Palestinian State.\"\n\n\"This illegality relates to the entirety of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in 1967,\" the ICJ wrote, referencing the 1967 war.\n\nReparations\n\nIn a 14 to 1 vote, the ICJ decided that \"Israel has the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\"\n\nIt is unclear what reparations would look like, but the court said the term includes \"restitution, compensation and/or satisfaction.\"\n\nThe document also noted \"Israel's systematic failure to prevent or punish attacks by settlers against the life or bodily integrity of Palestinians, as well as Israel's excessive use of force against Palestinians,\" which are inconsistent with Articles of the Geneva Convention.\n\nLegal Consequences for Other States\n\nThe top court wrote, \"All States must cooperate with the United Nations to put into effect modalities required to ensure an end to Israel's illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the full realization of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\"\n\nAs of May 2024, the 143 U.N. member countries voted in favor of a resolution to provide new \"rights and privileges\" to a Palestinian state and urge the Security Council to consider its admission to the U.N. Nine countries voted against the resolution, including the United States and Israel.\n\nFriday's opinion also stated that member countries have an \"obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel's illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\" The U.S. is a strong ally of Israel, providing hundreds of billions of dollars in military aid.\n\nIsrael has previously ignored and refuted rulings on the matter. The country faces another case in front of the court brought by South Africa, which alleges Israel committed genocide against Palestinians during this conflict. In May, the court ordered Israel to halt it's Rafah offensive. Israel has denied the allegation.", "source": {"uri": "kansas.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Wichita Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mandy_taheri@kansas.com", "name": "Mandy Taheri", "type":

No absurd opinion in the Hague can deny this historical truth or the legal right of Israelis to live in their own communities in our ancestoral home,\" he wrote on social media platform X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe court's decision comes amid a 10-month conflict between Israel and Hamas, which has killed over 34,000 Palestinians, displaced upward of 2 million, and flattened large swathes of Gaza, according to The Associated Press. Israel's continued military offensives are in response to Hamas' October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, in which around 250 hostages were taken and 1,200 people killed.\n\nThe court's ruling was prompted by a U.N. General Assembly vote in December 2022 requesting its opinion.\n\nThe court, with 11 votes in favor and 4 against, found that \"the State of Israel is under an obligation to bring to an end its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible.\"\n\nIt also determined that the \"Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law,\" rendering Israel's presence \"illegal.\"\n\nThe court, in a near unanimous vote, 14 to 1, called for the immediate cessation of new settlement constructions and to \"evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\"\n\nIn a March report by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) it was noted that approximately 700,000 Israeli settlers lived in the West Bank as of September 2023 and \"the size of existing Israeli settlements has expanded at the highest rate since monitoring began in 2017.\"\n\nIn relation to the report, OHCHR Chief, Volker Turk, said new settlements \"fly in the face of international law\" and \"settler violence and settlement-related violations have reached shocking new levels, and risk eliminating any practical possibility of establishing a viable Palestinian State.\"\n\n\"This illegality relates to the entirety of the Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in 1967,\" the ICJ wrote, referencing the 1967 war.\n\nIn a 14 to 1 vote, the ICJ decided that \"Israel has the obligation to make reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\"\n\nIt is unclear what reparations would look like, but the court said the term includes \"restitution, compensation and/or satisfaction.\"\n\nThe document also noted \"Israel's systematic failure to prevent or punish attacks by settlers against the life or bodily integrity of Palestinians, as well as Israel's excessive use of force against Palestinians,\" which are inconsistent with Articles of the Geneva Convention.\n\nThe top court wrote, \"All States must cooperate with the United Nations to put into effect modalities required to ensure an end to Israel's illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the full realization of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.\"\n\nAs of May 2024, the 143 U.N. member countries voted in favor of a resolution to provide new \"rights and privileges\" to a Palestinian state and urge the Security Council to consider its admission to the U.N. Nine countries voted against the resolution, including the United States and Israel.\n\nFriday's opinion also stated that member countries have an \"obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel's illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\" The U.S. is a strong ally of Israel, providing hundreds of billions of dollars in military aid.\n\nIsrael has previously ignored and refuted rulings on the matter. The country faces another case in front of the court brought by South Africa, which alleges Israel committed genocide against Palestinians during this conflict. In May, the court ordered Israel to halt it's Rafah offensive.

It said other nations were obliged not to \"render aid or assistance in maintaining\" Israel's presence in the territories. It said Israel must end settlement construction immediately and that existing settlements must be removed, according to a summary of the more than 80-page opinion read out by court President Nawaf Salam.\n\nIsrael's \"abuse of its status as the occupying power\" renders its \"presence in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful,\" the court said, saying its presence must be ended as \"rapidly as possible.\"\n\nThe court's opinion, sought by the U.N. General Assembly after a Palestinian request, came against the backdrop of Israel's devastating military assault on Gaza, which was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel on Oct. 7. In a separate case, the International Court of Justice is considering a South African claim that Israel's campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nThe court said the General Assembly and Security Council -- where staunch Israeli ally the United States holds a veto -- should consider \"the precise modalities\" to end Israel's presence in the territories.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, didn't send a legal team to the hearings. Instead, it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns. Israeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has been stagnant for more than a decade.\n\n\"The Jewish people are not conquerors in their own land -- not in our eternal capital Jerusalem and not in the land of our ancestors in Judea and Samaria,\" Netanyahu said in a statement issued by his office, using the biblical terms for the West Bank. \"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth and likewise the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\"\n\nSpeaking outside the court, Riad Malki, an adviser to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, called the opinion \"a watershed moment for Palestine, for justice and for international law.\"\n\nHe said other nations must now \"uphold the clear obligations\" outlined by the court. \"No actions of any kind ... to support Israel's illegal occupation.\"\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved populations there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that isn't internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nThe court's decision strikes at the heart of the ambiguity of Israel's administration of the territories. Israel hasn't annexed the West Bank -- though settler groups have pressed it to do so -- but it calls it part of its homeland and has effectively treated it as an extension of the nation. Along with the settlements, it has appropriated large swaths of the territory as \"state lands.\" At the same time, Netanyahu's government has repeatedly rejected the creation of any Palestinian state. Abbas' Palestinian Authority has been restricted to control over divided enclaves scattered around the West Bank.\n\nThe Palestinians presented arguments at hearings in February, along with 49 other nations and three international organizations. In the hearings, Malki accused Israel of apartheid and urged the United Nations' top court to declare that Israel's occupation of lands sought by the Palestinians is illegal and must end immediately and unconditionally for any hope for a two-state future to survive.\n\nErwin van Veen, a senior research fellow at the Clingendael think tank in The Hague, said before the decision that a ruling that Israel's policies breach international law would \"isolate Israel further internationally, at least from a legal point of view.\"\n\nHe said such a ruling would remove \"any kind of legal, political, philosophical underpinning of the Israeli expansion project.\" It could also increase the number of countries that recognize a Palestinian state, in particular in the Western world, following the recent example of Spain and Norway and Ireland, he said.\n\nIt's not the first time the ICJ has been asked to give its legal opinion on Israeli policies. Two decades ago, the court ruled that Israel's West Bank separation barrier was \"contrary to international law.\" Israel boycotted those proceedings, saying they were politically motivated.\n\nIsrael says the barrier is a security measure. Palestinians say the structure amounts to a massive land grab, because it frequently dips into the West Bank.\n\nIsrael has built well over 100 settlements, according to the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now. The West Bank settler population has grown by more than 15% in the past five years to more than 500,000 Israelis, according to a pro-settler group.\n\nIsrael also has annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city to be its capital. An additional 200,000 Israelis live in settlements built in east Jerusalem that Israel considers to be neighborhoods of its capital. Palestinian residents of the city face systematic discrimination, making it difficult for them to build new homes or expand existing ones.\n\nThe international community considers all settlements to be illegal or obstacles to peace since they are built on lands sought by the Palestinians for their state.\n\nNetanyahu's hard-line government is dominated by settlers and their political supporters. Netanyahu has given his finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, a former settler leader, unprecedented authority over settlement policy. Smotrich has used this position to cement Israel's control over the West Bank by pushing forward plans to build more settlement homes and to legalize outposts.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri":

The expected advisory opinion stems from a December 2022 request by the United Nations General Assembly to the court to consider the legal consequences of Israel's policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nThe ICJ held hearings on Israel's occupation over six days in February. Fifty countries and three international organizations participated in the oral proceedings, more than in any other case since the world's highest court began functioning in 1946, based on Human Rights Watch analysis.\n\n\"The World Court's opinion will be its first comprehensive assessment of the human rights consequences for Palestinians of Israel's occupation policies and practices,\" said Clive Baldwin, senior legal adviser at Human Rights Watch. \"The court's recommendations could shed light on the root causes underlying the current devastating atrocities and open the door to redress the flagrant harms committed by Israeli authorities with impunity over the past six decades.\"\n\nThe court has a broad remit in what it can cover in its advisory opinion based on the request from the UN General Assembly. It may address a range of issues from Israel's practices and policies violating international legal prohibitions against racial discrimination, including the crime against humanity of apartheid, to the continued application of international humanitarian law and human rights law under occupation.\n\nThe court may also assess the legal responsibilities of other countries and the UN to address violations of international law arising from Israel's occupation. States should adopt the ICJ's recommendations to guide their efforts to end violations of international humanitarian and human rights law against the Palestinians, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nIsrael, which rejects the applicability of the law of occupation to Palestine, unlawfully purported to annex occupied East Jerusalem in 1967, and in 2023 transferred key elements of its control over the West Bank from military to civilian authorities. It also refuses to acknowledge its responsibilities toward Palestinian civilians as the occupying power in the Gaza Strip. However, it remains, legally, the occupying power in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, with legal duties toward the civilian population in all the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\n\nThe ICJ's consideration of the legal consequences of Israel's occupation policies and practices began in December 2022 and so predates the October 2023 escalation of hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups. On October 7, 2023, Hamas-led Palestinian armed groups carried out an assault on southern Israel and took 251 people hostage, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity and have continued to launch indiscriminate rockets at population centers. Israeli forces have unlawfully attacked residential buildings, medical facilities, and aid workers, restricted medical evacuations, blocked humanitarian aid, and used starvation as a weapon of war in the Gaza Strip, which has suffered a staggering toll of over 38,600 people killed according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israeli authorities have detained incommunicado and mistreated thousands of Palestinians, with persistent reports of torture.\n\nIn the occupied West Bank, where Israeli forces have killed over 530 Palestinians since October 7, settlers and soldiers have displaced entire Palestinian communities, destroying every home, with the apparent backing of higher Israeli authorities and effectively confiscating their lands.\n\nThe World Court's advisory opinion is expected to focus on the legal consequences of the occupation, rather than specifically assessing the conduct of Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups during the recent hostilities. However, abuses and violations by all parties since October have taken place in the context of the occupation and the acceleration by Israeli authorities of illegal settlement expansion, as well as the ongoing commission of the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution against Palestinians. In submissions to the court, 25 countries cited the commission of the crimes against humanity of apartheid or persecution by Israel against Palestinians as one key consequence of the occupation.\n\nThe ICJ adjudicates disputes between states and issues advisory opinions on international law. It lacks jurisdiction over the conduct of non-state armed groups like Hamas. Although ICJ advisory opinions are nonbinding, they can carry great moral and legal authority and can ultimately become part of customary international law, which is legally binding on states. The last advisory opinion by the ICJ, in 2019, addressed the deportation of the inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago by the United Kingdom and the decolonization of Mauritius.\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly could convene a discussion on the opinion. By an overwhelming majority, it voted in 2004 to require Israel to abide by a July 2004 ICJ advisory opinion finding that the route of Israel's separation barrier violated international law and that it should be dismantled.\n\nThe proceeding is separate from the case brought at the court by South Africa, alleging that Israel is violating the Genocide Convention. While a ruling on the merits of that claim will most likely take years, the ICJ has threetimesordered Israel to take certain measures, including enabling the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Human Rights Watch research demonstrates that Israel is continuing to flout the court's orders, with devastating consequences for Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nThis ICJ proceeding is also distinct from proceedings before the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has a mandate to assess the criminal responsibility of individuals. On May 20, the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, announced that he was seeking arrest warrants against two senior Israeli officials and three Hamas leaders. Khan confirmed that his office is conducting an investigation since March 2021 into atrocity crimes committed in Gaza and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since 2014, and that his office has jurisdiction over crimes in the current hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups that covers unlawful conduct by all parties.\n\nGiven that the responsibilities of an occupying power toward the rights of the occupied population increase over time, Human Rights Watch has also called for Israel to provide Palestinians in the occupied territory with rights at least equal to those it grants its own citizens, in addition to the protections of international humanitarian law.\n\nThe ICJ is composed of 15 judges elected by the UN General Assembly and Security Council for nine-year terms. Fifty-seven states and international organizations had filed a written statement in the proceedings in July 2023. Fifteen states and international organizations filed additional written comments in October and November 2023. Israel submitted a written statement and chose not to participate in the oral hearings.\n\n\"The participation of so many states in the hearings leading up to the ruling demonstrates the importance of the issues before the World Court,\" Baldwin said. \"The opinion could provide a useful roadmap for states seeking to protect human rights and end years of impunity for human rights abuses in Israel and Palestine.\"", "source": {"uri": "hrw.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Human Rights Watch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki",

The latest move also marked Ben-Gvir's third such raid in Al Aqsa Mosque in less than a year in an ongoing attempt by Israel to change its status quo.\n\nSuch incidents bring back similar scenes from 2000, when former Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, stormed the Muslim site in a move that sparked the second Intifada, or Palestinian uprising.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the Israeli Knesset approved a draft resolution that completely rejects the establishment of a Palestinian state. The move came after a decision in February by the Knesset that rejected the \"unilateral\" international recognition of the Palestinian state.\n\n\"The establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the Land of Israel would constitute an existential threat to the State of Israel and its citizens, and would lead to the perpetuation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilise the region,\" the resolution states.\n\nThe head of the Official Right Party, Gideon Sa'ar, said that the resolution \"aims to express the comprehensive opposition that exists among the Israeli people to the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel's security and future.\"\n\nIsrael has long perceived the establishment of an independent Palestinian state as a threat to its existence after it illegally occupied the land in 1948 in what became widely known as the Nakba, or catastrophe.\n\nDuring the Nakba, Israel forcibly displaced and killed Palestinians to establish a Jewish state, marking the beginning of the illegal occupation and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians that persisted for 76 years.\n\nCommenting on the Knesset's latest decision, Palestine's presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeineh stressed that there will be no peace or security globally without the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\n\"He pointed out that these decisions confirm the insistence of Israel and its ruling coalition to push the entire region into the abyss, holding the United States responsible, due to its bias and unlimited support,\" Wafa reported, citing Abu Rudeineh.\n\nIsrael has intensified its policies and violations of Palestinians' rights following the beginning of its genocidal war in the Gaza Strip on October 7, 2023.\n\nSince the beginning of the war, Israel has killed at least 38,848 people, mostly women and children, in the Gaza Strip and displaced at least 1.9 million people out of the 2.1 million population.\n\nThe brutal onslaught in the Gaza Strip also saw an increase in raids in the occupied West Bank, where Israel detained more than 9,720 Palestinians, including former detainees and children.\n\nIsrael has also killed at least 576 Palestinians in the West Bank since the beginning of the war in the besieged enclave.\n\nMeanwhile, on Friday, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel's continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territory is illegal.\n\nThe ruling came after a 2022 request by the UN General Assembly that sought the Court's opinion on the legality of Israel's occupation of Palestine. Qatar was among the majority of 98 countries that voted in favour of the UNGA resolution.\n\nThe ICJ, also known as the World Court, called on Israel to end its presence on illegally occupied Palestinian territory \"as rapidly as possible.\"\n\nWhile the advisory opinion is non-binding, it has dealt a great blow to Israel's global reputation given its ongoing occupation of Palestine and violations of Palestinians' rights.\n\n\"Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have been established and are being maintained in violation of international law,\" Nawaf Salam, president of the ICJ, said while reading the advisory opinion.\n\nSalam underlined Israel's systematic discrimination against Palestinians in the occupied territory.\n\nIsrael occupied the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem in a bloody war in 1967, widely known as \"the Six-day War\" and Naksa, or \"setback.\" Within six days, Israel captured the majority of Palestine while forcibly displacing at least 300,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe current case is separate from the one South Africa had raised last year on whether Israel is committing a genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe Court had previously issued provisional measures on January 26, during which it ordered Israel to prevent incitement to commit genocide to allow more humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.\n\nHowever, Israel maintained its chokehold over the entry of aid and destroyed the vital Rafah Crossing following its invasion on May 6.", "source": {"uri": "dohanews.co", "dataType": "news",

It injects the politics of the corridors of the UN in New York into the courtrooms of the ICJ in The Hague.\"\n\n\"The opinion only distances the possibility of resolving the conflict,\" it added.\n\nThe ministry accused the Palestinian Authority, which initiated the move, of being \"uninterested in peace, but in slinging mud at Israel.\"\n\nFar-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said the ICJ findings \"prove for the thousandth time that this is a clearly political and anti-Semitic organization.\"\n\n\"We will not take moral lessons from them;

Their words undermine the entire notion of the process of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.\"\n\nBetzalel Smotrich, the hard-Right finance minister, and Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, also slammed the court's ruling, instead calling on the government to annex the West Bank.\n\nIsrael took control within the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza and the Golan Heights in the six-day war in 1967. It annexed the Golan Heights in 1981 but would later withdraw from Gaza in 2005, pulling out some 8,500 Jewish settlers.\n\nSome 500,000 Israelis are estimated to live across the West Bank, with some living in outposts deep in Palestinian territory.\n\nSettler violence against Palestinians has grown in recent years, in particular since the Oct 7 attacks.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk",

Friday's session is receiving heightened attention because of the war in Gaza, which is now in its ninth month, and because of a separate genocide case brought by South Africa against Israel in December over its conduct in the war.\n\nIn January, the court ordered Israel to restrain its attacks in Gaza, and in May it ordered the country to \"immediately\" halt its military offensive in the city of Rafah, in southern Gaza.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly in 2022 asked the court for its opinion on the legal consequences of Israel's \"prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation\" of the territories, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967. The court held hearings in February at the Peace Palace in The Hague.\n\nIsrael did not appear at that session but filed a submission rejecting the validity of the proceedings as biased. The Palestinian Authority's foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, told the court that Israel had subjected Palestinians to decades of discrimination, leaving them with the choice of \"displacement, subjugation or death.\"\n\nOver the course of several days, representatives of more than 50 countries, an unusually high number for the court, addressed the hearings. Most sided with the Palestinian representatives. But a few speakers at the court, including those from the United States, Britain and Hungary -- among Israel's traditional allies -- sided with Israel.\n\nA U.S. State Department official argued before the court that Israel's policies toward the Palestinians were determined by its \"very real security needs.\"\n\nOne focal point of Friday's opinion will likely be Israel's settlement policy in the West Bank and East Jerusalem -- both the officially promoted expansion of settlements for Israeli citizens on Palestinian territory as well as the government's tolerance of violent land grabs by settlers.\n\nEvery Israeli government has allowed some Israeli construction in the territories, but the Netanyahu government has expanded the program and announced plans for thousands of new housing units.

They warned a prolonged occupation posed an \"extreme danger\" to stability in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nBut the United States said Israel should not be legally obliged to withdraw without taking its \"very real security needs\" into account.\n\nIsrael did not take part in the oral hearings.\n\nInstead, it submitted a written contribution in which it described the questions the court had been asked as \"prejudicial\" and \"tendentious\".\n\n- 'Ongoing violation' - More from this section 'We are seeing real pain.'

Normally, its judgements are binding although it has little means to enforce them.\n\nIn this case however, the opinion it issues will be non-binding, although most advisory opinions are in fact acted upon.\n\njhe/jj", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jan_hennop@reformer.com", "name": "Jan Hennop", "type": "author",

Friday's session is receiving heightened attention because of the war in Gaza, which is now in its ninth month, and because of a separate genocide case brought by South Africa against Israel in December over its conduct in the war.\n\nIn January, the court ordered Israel to restrain its attacks in Gaza, and in May it ordered the country to \"immediately\" halt its military offensive in the city of Rafah, in southern Gaza.\n\nThe U.N. General Assembly in 2022 asked the court for its opinion on the legal consequences of Israel's \"prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation\" of the territories, including the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967. The court held hearings in February at the Peace Palace in The Hague.\n\nIsrael did not appear at that session but filed a submission rejecting the validity of the proceedings as biased. The Palestinian Authority's foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki, told the court that Israel had subjected Palestinians to decades of discrimination, leaving them with the choice of \"displacement, subjugation or death.\"\n\nOver the course of several days, representatives of more than 50 countries, an unusually high number for the court, addressed the hearings. Most sided with the Palestinian representatives. But a few speakers at the court, including those from the United States, Britain and Hungary -- among Israel's traditional allies -- sided with Israel.\n\nA U.S. State Department official argued before the court that Israel's policies toward the Palestinians were determined by its \"very real security needs.\"\n\nOne focal point of Friday's opinion will likely be Israel's settlement policy in the West Bank and East Jerusalem -- both the officially promoted expansion of settlements for Israeli citizens on Palestinian territory as well as the government's tolerance of violent land grabs by settlers.\n\nEvery Israeli government has allowed some Israeli construction in the territories, but the Netanyahu government has expanded the program and announced plans for thousands of new housing units. More than 400,000 Israelis have settled in the West Bank since 1967.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In the short or even medium term, I don't think the advisory opinion will have direct impact on Israel's behavior, but it may help to change the political calculus in the West,\" he said.\n\nMarco Longobardo, an international law expert at the University of Westminster, said the ICJ opinion \"will be a powerful instrument to clarify the legal framework of the Israeli occupation.\"\n\n\"More than an issue of permanency, the crux is whether the occupation is lawful. If the court says that the entire occupation is unlawful, this will make more difficult for third states to support the ongoing occupation by Israel,\" he told Anadolu.\n\n\"Dealing with Israeli practice in the occupied territory might become 'radioactive' in international relations. More states may decide not to support Israel, particularly in the fields of economic and defense cooperation.\"\n\nWhile Tel Aviv \"will likely ignore the opinion,\" it would still \"render Israel more isolated in international relations,\" he asserted.\n\n'Legal findings of advisory opinion have significant authority'\n\nLongobardo explained that the top UN court will address \"the legality of the entire occupation of the Palestinian territory by Israel in light of international humanitarian law, international human rights law, the principle of self-determination of peoples and other rules of international law.\"\n\nIt will also discuss the \"consequences of this potentially illegal occupation for third states and the UN,\" he said.\n\n\"Formally speaking, the opinion is not binding on states since it is not directed to states. However, the legal findings of an advisory opinion have significant authority since the opinion is rendered by the ... principal judicial organ of the UN,\" he emphasized.\n\nKemp built on that by stressing that ICJ opinions \"can be persuasive and may influence the political and diplomatic behaviour of states.\"\n\nAs an example, he cited the June 1971 advisory opinion by the ICJ that South Africa's continued presence in Namibia was illegal and it was obligated to withdraw immediately.\n\n\"It is believed (including by Namibia itself) that the ICJ's advisory opinion in that case contributed to the international pressure that eventually led to the independence of Namibia, free from South African occupation,\" he said.\n\nKemp expects the ICJ to say \"something substantive about whether Israel is practicing and imposing a system of apartheid on the people of Palestine in the occupied territories.\"\n\n\"This will be the first time that the ICJ will prominently address the question of apartheid in the context of Palestine,\" he said.\n\nThe issue was \"prominently argued by South Africa and Namibia in their submissions to the ICJ,\" he said.\n\n\"South Africa submitted that the prohibition of apartheid is a peremptory norm under international law, and I hope the ICJ will say something about this and how apartheid affects the people of Palestine,\" said Kemp.\n\n\"Indeed, the current conflict in Gaza, the alleged ongoing genocide, these are all connected to the broader systemic issues of occupation and apartheid.\"\n\nLongobardo, who has authored a book titled The Use of Armed Force in Occupied Territory, also believes the timing of the opinion is crucial in the current context.\n\n\"The Gaza Strip is part of the Palestinian territory and it is under Israeli occupation. Israel does not recognize its responsibilities as an occupying power in the area,\" he said.\n\n\"The opinion would clarify this issue and would likely question the entitlement of Israel to maintain control over the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nIn the broader picture, the legal findings will also \"have an impact on proceedings over individual and state responsibility before the International Criminal Court and the ICJ,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "aa.com.tr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anadolu Ajans\u0131"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_opinion",

General Assembly, predating the war in Gaza that began in October.\n\nIn a swift reaction, Israel's foreign ministry rejected the opinion as \"fundamentally wrong\" and one-sided, and repeated its stance that a political settlement in the region can only be reached by negotiations.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaf_Salam", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nawaf Salam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annexation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advisory opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.reutersnews.com/46cdb719c8c187be864a02d7bd791c6f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745204", "eventUri": "eng-9745204", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Israeli settlements in the West Bank began after the Six-Day War in 1967.\n\nThe ruling by the court is a non-binding advisory opinion on the legality of Israeli occupation of lands in the Palestinian territory. The case stems from a request made by the United Nations General Assembly in 2022 for an advisory opinion on the matter.\n\nOn Friday, the panel of 15 judges from around the world said that \"the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as Israel's maintenance of their presence, is contrary to Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention\".\n\nThe Fourth Geneva Convention deals with protection of civilians in a conflict zone. Article 49 of the convention pertains to deportations, transfers and evacuations.\n\nThe International Court of Justice also said that the use of natural resources was \"inconsistent\" with Israel's obligations under international law as an occupying power, The Guardian reported.\n\nThe ruling came amid Israel's war on the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Israel's attacks on the besieged enclave began on October 7 after Hamas militants invaded southern Israel, killing 1,200 persons and taking over 200 hostages.\n\nOver the past nine months, Israel has carried out unprecedented air and ground strikes on Gaza. The attacks have killed at least 38,000 persons, including over 15,000 children.\n\nMore than 500 persons have been killed in the West Bank region of Palestine during this period, according to Al Jazeera.\n\nIn a separate case, the United Nations court is also considering a claim by South Africa that Tel Aviv's military campaign in Gaza amounts to genocide. Israel has rejected the claim.\n\nIn January, the United Nations court had said in an interim order that Israel must take measures to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza. However, it stopped short of ordering a ceasefire.\n\nIn March, the court ordered Israel to ensure that food supplies are delivered without delay to people in Gaza. It also told Tel Aviv to ensure that basic services and humanitarian assistance - including electricity, fuel and shelter - are provided.\n\nThe order was legally binding on Israel, but the international court does not have a mechanism to enforce the directions.", "source": {"uri": "scroll.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scroll.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The court also voted to call on Israel to evacuate all settlers from the West Bank.\n\n[In February, the Biden administration restored the 50-year old U.S. position that the occupation is \"illegitimate\" -- not \"illegal.\" The Trump administration Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the U.S. no longer viewed the occupation as illegitimate.]", "source": {"uri": "consortiumnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Consortiumnews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaf_Salam", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nawaf Salam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Lebanon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Israel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Pompeo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Pompeo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/6982134155_98d6a8c896_k.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745204", "eventUri": "eng-9745204", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

occupation.\"\n\nIn reference to Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories, the court noted that Israel's \"exploitation of natural resources\" in occupied Palestinian territory is \"inconsistent with its obligation\" to respect Palestinians' right to sovereignty.\n\nMore particularly on the forcible evictions in Eastern Jerusalem and West Bank, the court stressed that Israel's policies and practices violate the 4th Geneva Convention's prohibition on forcible transfer of protected populations.\n\n\"Israel's settlement policy is in breach of the 4th Geneva Convention,\" it said.\n\nThe court said Israel's policies and practices amount to the annexation of large parts of occupied Palestinian territory, and that it is \"not convinced\" that extending Israeli law to the West Bank and East Jerusalem is justified.\n\nICJ also maintained that Israel has been able to exercise key authority over the Gaza Strip despite the withdrawal of its military presence in 2005.",

Depending on its finding, it could mark the first time the ICJ has delivered a position on whether the 57-year occupation is illegal.In this case, the court will issue an advisory opinion, which is not legally binding but will still carry significant political weight.Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Middle East war. It withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, retaining control over its airspace, shared border and shoreline. Despite the pullout, the UN still considers Gaza as part of the occupied territories.As the occupying power, Israel's actions in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza are subject to a detailed set of rules under international law governing occupation, designed to protect the occupied civilian population. Before hearings started in February this year, Israel issued a statement saying it did not recognise \"the legitimacy of the discussion\" at the ICJ.

had been looking into Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories following a request from the United Nations General Assembly that predates Hamas's Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel and Israel's subsequent response in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli officials have long claimed international bodies discriminate against them, and they did so again in response to the International Court of Justice's ruling Friday, which is different than South Africa's case in front of the court accusing Israel of carrying out a genocide in Gaza -- a claim both Israel and the U.S. denies.\n\nFeatured Local

West Bank. \"No false decision in The Hague will distort this historical truth, and likewise, the legality of Israeli settlement in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\"\n\nAlternatively, the Palestinian Authority's foreign ministry called the opinion \"a watershed moment,\" adding that the \"international community is under an obligation not just to reaffirm the Palestinian people's right to self-determination but to see to it that this right is implemented immediately.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nEarlier this

Israel felt reassured that its closest allies did not support the resolution, forming what Israel refers to as a \"moral minority\" of western liberal democratic states supporting it. The court's February hearings were extensive, with over 50 countries giving evidence. Israel, however, opted not to cooperate with the process, arguing that it was \"part of the Palestinian attempt to dictate the results of the diplomatic settlement without negotiations\" - an alleged tactic often referred to as 'lawfare'. It expressed its view that the court lacked appropriate jurisdiction in a submission to the court itself. At the time of the UN resolution calling for the ICJ's opinion, Prime Minister Netanyahu said \"just like the hundreds of distorted UN General Assembly resolutions against Israel over the years, today's disgraceful resolution will not obligate the government of Israel. The Jewish people is not occupying its land and is not occupying its eternal capital Jerusalem. No UN resolution can distort this historical truth.\"\n\nContext: The ICJ is one of the UN's principle organs. It's opinions, though usually non-binding, often contribute to customary international law.\n\nThe court is composed of 15 judges who are elected to by the UN General Assembly and Security Council to serve for nine-year terms. The court's current president is Lebanese judge Nawaf Salam, who has a history of harsh criticism of Israel. In 2004, the court was requested by the UN to deliver an advisory opinion on the legality of the separation barrier between Israel and the West Bank. Unlike in the recent case called by South Africa, the ICJ's advisory opinion on the current case will be non-binding. Critics argue that Israel's non-participation means that the ICJ will lack the necessary factual basis required to reach an informed decision. As former Israeli Supreme Court Aharon Barak noted of the 2004 case, \"in the proceedings before the ICJ, the injured parties did not participate. Israel was not party to the proceedings. There was no adversarial process, whose purpose is to establish the factual basis through a choice between contradictory factual figures. The ICJ accepted the figures in the [UN] Secretary-General's report, and in the reports of the special rapporteurs, as objective factual figures. The burden was not cast upon the parties to the proceedings, nor was it examined.\" Legal critics of the court's processes have argued that it tends to rely too heavily on evidence supplied by the UN itself. These same critics have cast doubt on the reliability of this UN-supplied evidence, pointing, for example, to the international body's general acceptance of Hamas casualty figures from the current war in Gaza. Of the current case, critics also note that, in the case of East Jerusalem, the will of the Palestinian population is likely to be ignored. Polling has indicated that, by a large majority, East Jerusalemites have indicated a preference for the area remaining under Israeli control. Unlike the West Bank, East Jerusalemites hold Israeli residence permits, giving them full freedom of movement, full rights to the benefits of Israeli citizenship, including healthcare and national insurance payments (bar the right to vote for the Knesset, unless they apply for citizenship). Earlier this year, in another anti-Israel motivated move, South Africa brought a case to the ICJ accusing Israel of genocide in its war in Gaza. The court accepted the case, and its full investigation could take several years. Israel took control of the West Bank in a defensive war in June 1967, during which time Jerusalem was also unified. The UN has generally held that this occupation was/is unlawful, pointing to the general international legal principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force. Critics of this view argue that this principle cannot justly be applied to territory occupied during a defensive war, and that the previous custodian of the areas - Jordan - had not right to occupy them either. However, multiple Israeli governments, including the Prime Minister Netanyahu in his famous Bar Ilan speech, have accepted in principle that the West Bank would form part of an independent Palestinian state under a future two state solution, with appropriate modifications made to account for Israeli settlement there and Israel's security needs. The repeated failure of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank to clamp down on terror and to cease incitement and inducement to commit it has led many in Israel to grow sceptical of the wisdom of such a two state solution. October 7th has only added to the view that, as presently constituted, the Palestinian national movement cannot be considered a peaceful partner to such a process. This week, by 68 votes to 9, the Knesset passed a declarative resolution rejecting the prospect of a two state solution. Yair Lapid's Yesh Atid and the Labour Party, as well as the prime minister himself, absented themselves from the Knesset chamber in order to avoid the vote. The resolution said that \"the Knesset of Israel firmly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state west of Jordan. The establishment of a Palestinian state in the heart of the Land of Israel will pose an existential danger to the State of Israel and its citizens, perpetuate the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and destabilise the region.\" \"It will only be a matter of a short time until Hamas takes over the Palestinian state and turns it into a radical Islamic terror base, working in coordination with the Iranian-led axis to eliminate the State of Israel,\" it continued. \"Promoting the idea of a Palestinian state at this time will be a reward for terrorism and will only encourage Hamas and its supporters to see this as a victory, thanks to the massacre of October 7, 2023, and a prelude to the takeover of jihadist Islam in the Middle East.\" However, the resolution should be seen as a symbolic gesture reflecting the view of the current government as well as the scepticism of Benny Gantz's opposition faction. It is a recognition of the current fears of the majority of Israelis regarding two states, rather than a binding policy position which might impede future Israeli governments in pursuing a two state solution.\n\nLooking ahead: The announcement is expected in The Hague at 3pm local time.\n\nAlthough Israel was not party to the proceedings, pressure will likely grow from the furthest right-wing elements in the government to punish the Palestinians for such a perceived act of lawfare. They will likely push for further unilateral actions in the West Bank, further exacerbating international criticism. Israeli officials are concerned over the possibility that the court will advise the UN that Israel is violating international law, and may even call on another international juridical body, the International Criminal Court, to initiate criminal proceedings against Israeli officials in the West Bank.

The court called for Israel to rapidly quit the occupied territories and ruled Palestinians were due reparations for the harm of 57 years of an occupation that systematically discriminates against them.\n\nAnd in its many parts, the judgment represents a devastating defeat for Israel in world court.\n\nWhile numerous UN reports and resolutions in the general assembly have made the same point, the ICJ ruling, by virtue of being made in reference to treaty and individual laws, represents a judgment that will be hard to ignore.\n\nThe ruling also stood as a rebuke to Israel's argument that the ICJ had no standing to consider the issue on the grounds that UN resolutions, as well as bilateral Israeli-Palestinian agreements, had established that the correct framework for resolving the conflict should be political, not legal.\n\nEffectively rejecting that argument, the court asserted that international law applies regardless of the decades of failed political efforts to reach a lasting peace agreement, not least as Israel has continued with its settlement building.\n\nTaking half an hour to read, the ruling gathered together multiple strands of international law from the Geneva conventions to the Hague convention to make a case that has been obvious to Palestinians and to critics of Israeli policy in the international community for years.\n\nIn summary it said that years of Israel's own officially and self-described ambitions to build and settle in the occupied territories amounted to an intent to effectively annex territory against international law; that those policies were designed to benefit settlers and Israel, not the Palestinians living under military administration.\n\nPerhaps the most significant section was the judgment that by \"the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as Israel's maintenance of their presence, is contrary to article 49 of the 4th Geneva convention\".\n\nWhile the individual paragraphs applying to each breach of international law - and each inconsistency - were not surprising, taken in its entirety the ruling offers a profound challenge to governments, including the UK and US, that had for years soft pedalled on Israel's occupation policies, criticising settlement building but until recently doing little practical about it.\n\nIf that has changed in recent months, with a raft of US, UK and European sanctions targeting violent settlers, both individually and the groups that support them, the advisory ruling poses a far more serious question: whether, given the severity of the breaches of international law, sanctions should also be applied to Israeli ministers and institutions supporting the settlement enterprise.\n\nWhile non-binding, the ruling will provide ample ammunition for government lawyers already actively examining future sanctions against those linked to Israeli settlement.\n\nSignificant in the ruling was that the court had noted the recent and continuing transfer of powers from the military to civilian officials overseeing the occupied territories, which critics had warned further exposed Israel activities to the court.\n\nThe timing too is significant. With Israel isolated over its conduct of the Gaza war, and under investigation both at the ICJ and the international criminal court for alleged war crimes, the stark assessment of the long-term illegality of Israel's occupation will only reinforce that isolation.\n\nIf the ruling felt inevitable, it was because of Israel's own rightward drift under it's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who now heads a coalition that includes far-right pro-settler parties and ministers and has embraced exactly the policies for which Israel has been condemned.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk",

in the occupied Palestinian territory unlawful\", adding that its continued presence was \"illegal\" and should be ended as \"rapidly as possible\".\n\nIn the opinion read out by court president Nawaf Salam, the court found that \"the transfer by Israel of settlers to the West Bank and Jerusalem as well as Israel's maintenance of their presence, is contrary to article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention\".\n\nREAD MORE: Top UN official demands Israel be 'unseated' from organisation\n\nThe court also noted with \"grave concern\" that Israel's settlement policy has been expanding.\n\nThe court also found that Israel's use of natural resources was \"inconsistent\" with its obligations under international law as an occupying power.\n\nThe ruling is likely to have more effect on international opinion than it will on Israeli policies.\n\nIsrael, which normally considers the United Nations and international tribunals as unfair and biased, did not send a legal team to the hearings.\n\nBut it submitted written comments, saying that the questions put to the court are prejudiced and fail to address Israeli security concerns.\n\nThe UN's top court rebuked Israel's settlement policies as unlawful\n\nIsraeli officials have said the court's intervention could undermine the peace process, which has been stagnant for more than a decade.\n\nThe ruling comes after the UN's special rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, said it was \"time to unseat Israel from the UN\".\n\nAlbanese's comments came after the headquarters of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in Gaza were destroyed by Israeli bombs.\n\nThe commissioner general of UNRWA described the attack as \"another episode in the blatant disregard of international humanitarian law.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the UK Government has said it will resume funding to UNWRA following allegations from Israel that its staff were involved in the October 7 attack perpetrated by Hamas.\n\nFormer French foreign minister Catherine Colonna undertook an independent review into the allegations but said she was given no evidence by Israel to back up their claims.\n\nThe USA is now the only country yet to resume funding to UNRWA.", "source": {"uri": "www-tmp.thenational.scot", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

They warned a prolonged occupation posed an \u201cextreme danger\u201d to stability in the Middle East and beyond.\n\nBut the United States said Israel should not be legally obliged to withdraw without taking its \u201cvery real security needs\u201d into account.\n\nIsrael did not take part in the oral hearings.\n\nInstead, it submitted a written contribution in which it described the questions the court had been asked as \u201cprejudicial\u201d and \u201ctendentious\u201d.\n\nThe General Assembly asked the ICJ to consider two questions.\n\nFirstly, the court should examine the legal consequences of what the UN called \u201cthe ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination\u201d.\n\nThis relates to the \u201cprolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967\u201d and \u201cmeasures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Holy City of Jerusalem\u201d.\n\nIn June 1967, Israel crushed some of its Arab neighbours in a six-day war, seizing the West Bank including east Jerusalem from Jordan, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula from Egypt.\n\nIsrael then began to settle the 70,000 sq km (27,000 sq miles) of seized Arab territory.\n\nThe UN later declared the occupation of Palestinian territory illegal, and Cairo regained Sinai under its 1979 peace deal with Israel.\n\nThe ICJ was also asked to look into the consequences of what it described as Israel\u2019s \u201cadoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures\u201d.\n\nSecondly, the ICJ was asked to advise on how Israel\u2019s actions \u201caffect the legal status of the occupation\u201d and what are the consequences for the UN and other countries.\n\nThe ICJ rules in disputes between states. Normally, its judgments are binding but it has few means to enforce them.\n\nIn this case however, the opinion is non-binding, although most advisory opinions are in fact acted upon.\n\nThe ICJ has previously issued advisory opinions on the legality of Kosovo\u2019s 2008 declaration of independence from Serbia and apartheid South Africa\u2019s occupation of Namibia.\n\nIt also handed down an opinion in 2004 declaring that parts of the wall erected by Israel in the occupied Palestinian territory were illegal and should be torn down.\n\nIsrael has not complied with the ICJ ruling, and has resisted calls to route the barrier along the Green Line, the 1949 Armistice Line established after the end of fighting that accompanied Israel\u2019s establishment a year earlier.", "source": {"uri":

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the court's opinion.\n\nThe opinion, which was handed down by a panel of 15 judges from around the world, including the United States, had 11 votes in favor and four against in declaring the settlements illegal.\n\nThe judges in favor include the court's president from Lebanon, and judges from Somalia, China, India, Japan, Germany, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, the United States, and South Africa. The four dissenting judges included the court's vice-president from Uganda, plus judges from Slovakia, France, and Romania.\n\nIn a separate 14-1 vote, the ICJ panel called for the immediate stoppage of new settlement constructions and to \"evacuate all settlers\" from what the judges described as \"occupied Palestinian territory,\" referring to East Jerusalem and the West Bank. The lone dissenting judge in this instance was Vice-President Julia Sebutinde from Uganda.\n\nThe ICJ opinion also found that the U.N. Security Council, the U.N. General Assembly, and all member states have an obligation not to recognize the settlements as legal and should not \"render aid or assistance\" toward maintaining Israel's presence in the territories.\n\nThe Palestinian Foreign Ministry described the opinion \"historic\" and urged U.N. states to adhere to it. \"No aid. No assistance. No complicity. No money, no arms, no trade ... no actions of any kind to support Israel's illegal occupation,\" Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said outside the court in The Hague.\n\nThe case stems from a 2022 request for a legal opinion from the U.N. General Assembly, predating the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza that began last October. Israel took over the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem during the 1967 Middle East conflict known as the Six-Day War that pitted Israel against Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and several other Arab nations.\n\nIn a swift response on Friday, Mr. Netanyahu rejected the court's findings.\n\nIsrael's foreign ministry also rejected the opinion as \"fundamentally wrong\" and one-sided, and repeated its stance that a political settlement in the region can only be reached by negotiations.\n\nThe opinion also angered West Bank settlers as well as politicians such as Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, whose party is close to the settler movement and who himself lives in a West Bank settlement.\n\n\"The answer to The Hague - Sovereignty now,\" he wrote in a post on X, in an apparent appeal to formally annex the West Bank.\n\nIsrael Gantz, head of the Binyamin Regional Council, one of the largest settler councils, also said that the ICJ opinion was \"contrary to the Bible, morality, and international law.\"\n\nThe United States, which has not issued a public comment on the ICJ opinion Friday, had asked the court not to order the unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Palestinian territories. The U.S. position was that the court should issue no decision that could hurt negotiations toward a two-state solution on a \"land for peace\" principle.\n\nThe ICJ decision comes months after the International Criminal Court issued a statement saying it would pursue an arrest warrant for Mr. Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and several Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes committed during the Israel-Hamas conflict that erupted after the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks that left 1,200 civilians dead and 250 kidnapped, including American citizens.", "source": {"uri":

In an opinion article in The Guardian, she wrote: \"This responsibility now falls to Labour.\"\n\nMr Corbyn said movements such as Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), which promotes economic boycotts of Israel's illegal settlements, have for years \"been smeared and debased\".\n\n\"Today, they await a swift and deserved apology,\" he told . \"Boycotts, divestments and sanctions helped end apartheid in South Africa. They will be essential to ending the apartheid regime in Israel, too.\n\n\"If the Government was serious about respecting international law, it would immediately distance itself from the previous government's attacks on BDS campaigners. And they would immediately and unconditionally recognise the state of Palestine, as a first step to a just and lasting peace.\"\n\nMr Corbyn and a group of fellow independent MPs on Monday wrote to Foreign Secretary David Lammy with a series of demands over Gaza, among them a plea to drop any legal challenge to the ICC's application for an arrest warrant against Mr Netanyahu.\n\nIsraeli media reports have claimed Israel made an unofficial agreement with the previous Conservative government to challenge the ICC's jurisdiction in the Gaza Strip, in exchange for the UK to gain access and inspect conditions at detention facilities holding Hamas militants who have been under arrest since 7 October.\n\nThe Foreign Office has been contacted for comment.\n\nThe UK's request to lodge the challenge was made on 10 June but was only made public three weeks ago by the ICC.\n\nIsrael was apparently relying on the legal bid to derail the ICC's efforts, but there are conflicting reports on whether Labour will withdraw or keep the challenge - Israel's Maariv newspaper suggested it still stands, while The Guardian reported that the party believes the ICC does have jurisdiction over Gaza.\n\nEither way, Israeli legal officials believe it is \"highly probable\" the ICC will issue arrest warrants in the next fortnight, according to Israel's Channel 14.\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli officials believe the ICJ will declare that Israel is permanently occupying the West Bank in violation of international law, Haaretz reported, fearing it could bring fresh sanctions by Western governments against individuals and organisations associated with the settler movement.\n\nThe impending ICJ ruling comes at the request of the UN General Assembly less than two years ago - before the war in Gaza began - when it asked the court for an advisory opinion on Israel's military and civilian presence in the West Bank.\n\nA record 52 countries presented arguments to the ICJ during public hearings in February, with the UK, under the last government, submitting an opinion against the case.\n\nThe ICJ has already issued a series of orders against Israel in another case dealing with the war in Gaza, which was brought by South Africa after it accused Israel of committing genocide in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe UK has in recent months joined many Western nations in sanctioning \"extremist Israeli groups\" over violence against Palestinian communities in the West Bank, which has seen a deadly wave of settler attacks since 7 October.\n\nMr Lammy raised concerns over settler expansion with the Israeli leadership when he visited Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories earlier this week. Haaretz reported that the issue, including controversial remarks made by Israel's finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, was raised at every meeting the Foreign Secretary attended.\n\nMr Smotrich, a member of the hard-right wing Religious Zionism party who lives in a settlement, called on Mr Netanyahu to annex the West Bank should the ICJ declare Israeli settlements illegal.\n\nHe said the Israeli leader should \"respond to them with a historic decision of applying sovereignty to the territories of the homeland\", The Times of Israel reported.\n\nHe also promised to \"thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state through massive construction, regulating settlements, building roads and other measures in the field\" - moves that are illegal under international law.\n\nWhile human rights experts say sanctions are an important step, they do not go far enough to stem settler violence.\n\nKenneth Roth, the former executive director of Human Rights Watch, pointed to how the UN Security Council, the UN's highest body, called Israel's settlements a \"flagrant violation\" of international law in 2016 and ordered it to cease all settlement activity.\n\n\"Obviously, Israel hasn't done that, and Western governments have not imposed sanctions,\" he told . \"What is needed is not yet another legal statement of the obvious, but enforcement of the law.\"\n\nArticle 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 states it is a war crime for an occupying power to transfer its population to occupied territory. \"That's what the settlements are,\" Mr Roth said.\n\n\"The ICJ will undoubtedly reaffirm that, but the real question is why Western governments are doing so little - really, nothing - to enforce the law.\"\n\nAn advisory opinion is not binding, and it is up to state parties to decide whether they follow any determination of an opinion.\n\nIsrael has ignored such opinions in the past, but the ICJ ruling could add political pressure on the country that has already seen its global reputation tarnished by the Gaza conflict.\n\nMarc Weller, professor of international law and international constitutional studies at the University of Cambridge, said advisory opinions are highly authoritative in terms of clarifying the law on contested points.\n\n\"In this instance, a further opinion will likely strengthen the diplomatic position of states supporting the legal claims of the Palestinian side, and of potential Palestinian statehood,\" he told .\n\n\"Israel may not comply and her close allies may complain, but the court is the highest, best-placed international agency to pronounce itself in the matter.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "taz_ali@inews.co.uk", "name": "Taz Ali",

Israel's prolonged occupation and colonisation of the Palestinian territory in violation of international law.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the International Court of Justice had made a \"decision of lies\" on Friday by ruling Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories illegal.\n\n\"The Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land -- not in our eternal capital Jerusalem, nor in our ancestral heritage of Judea and Samaria\" (the occupied West Bank), Netanyahu said in a statement.\n\n\"No decision of lies in The Hague will distort this historical truth, and similarly, the legality of Israeli settlements in all parts of our homeland cannot be disputed.\"", "source": {"uri": "jordantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jordan Times"},

The International Court of Justice, the highest judicial body in the United Nations, has affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, and that the continued occupation of their lands does not change their legal status approved by international laws and conventions.\n\nOn Friday, the court announced its advisory opinion on the legal consequences of the Zionist occupation of the Palestinian territories since 1967, and reached a decision that \"Israel is an occupying force in Gaza and the West Bank, including east of occupied Jerusalem/ al-Quds\"\n\nChairman of the Court Judge Nawaf Salam read the advisory opinion in a public session held at the Court's headquarters in the \"Peace Palace\" in The Hague, Netherlands, stressing that the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 represent lands with unity, continuity, and sovereignty that must be respected.\n\nOn December 31, 2022, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution requesting the International Court of Justice to issue a non-binding \"advisory opinion\" on \"the legal consequences arising from Israel's policies and practices in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem,\" relating to the long-term occupation. for the Palestinian territories since 1967.\n\nSalam stressed that the continued presence of the occupation authorities in the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 \"is illegal, and that they are obligated to end their presence there as soon as possible, and that the continued occupation of the Palestinian territories for a long period of time does not change their legal status.\"\n\nHe pointed out that the occupation authorities accelerated the establishment of new settlements in the West Bank, which amounted to more than 24 thousand settlement units, stressing that they must stop all new settlement activities.\n\nSalam stated that the occupation authorities' confiscation of Palestinian lands and granting them to settlers \"is not temporary and violates the Geneva Convention.\"\n\nHe expressed that the court was not convinced that expanding the application of Zionist law in the West Bank and occupied Jerusalem was \"justified,\" pointing out that the occupation authorities imposed their authority as an occupying force in a way that contradicts what was stated in Articles 53 and 64 of the Geneva Convention.\n\nHe said the occupation authorities cannot \"displace the population of the occupied territories or settle some of their citizens there.\"\n\nHe added transferring settlers to the West Bank or occupied East Jerusalem contradicts Article 49 of the Geneva Convention, and detaining Palestinian property by settlers violates the obligations of the international occupying authorities.\n\nHe stated that the court will study the judicial repercussions of the illegal presence of the occupation authorities in the occupied territories, and that \"the advisory opinion is based on the premise that the Palestinian territories are territories under occupation.\"\n\nSalam stated that the current advisory opinion does not include the war that broke out in Gaza in October 2023.\n\nHe explained that the occupation authorities maintained their authority over the Gaza Strip, especially monitoring its air, sea and land borders, and that \"Israel's duties in the occupied territories are subject to the 1959 treaty regarding the treatment of civilians in times of war.\"\n\nSalam confirmed that the occupation authorities had abandoned their obligations in the Treaty against Racial Discrimination concluded in 1965, calling on the occupation authorities to adhere to the Sidra Treaty when exercising their powers outside their territories.\n\nThe rulings of the International Court of Justice are final for the states parties concerned in the case and are not subject to appeal, according to Article 94 (1) of the United Nations Charter, which stipulates that \"every member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decision of the International Court of Justice in any case to which it is a party.\" Article 94 (2) also states that in the event of non-compliance, \"the Security Council may, if it deems it necessary, make recommendations or decide on the measures to be taken to implement the ruling.\"\n\nThis is the second time that the United Nations General Assembly has asked the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion related to the occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nH.H", "source": {"uri": "saba.ye", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0633\u0628\u0623\u0646\u062a -

It also addressed measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character, and status of the City of Al-Quds Al-Sharif, and the broader legal implications of these actions.\n\nIn February, the ICJ began deliberations on the case after hearing arguments and public briefings from the State of Palestine, 49 UN member states, and three international organizations over the course of a week.\n\nThe court's forthcoming opinion comes amid growing international legal pressure on Israel, as it continues its military actions in Gaza and the West Bank, described by many as acts of genocide against the Palestinian people.\n\nThis advisory opinion is separate from another lawsuit filed by South Africa against Israel at the ICJ, accusing it of genocide in its ongoing aggression against Gaza since last October. While the ICJ issued temporary measures in January, stating that Israel must prevent genocide and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, a final decision on that case may take several years.\n\nThe international community awaits the ICJ's advisory opinion, which is expected to have significant implications for the legal status of the Israeli occupation and its broader consequences.\n\nH.H", "source": {"uri": "saba.ye", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0633\u0628\u0623\u0646\u062a -

The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\nFriday's strike came a day after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, a move that threatened negotiations to end the 9-month-old war in Gaza.\n\nHamas' Oct. 7 attack sparked the war when militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducting about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide -- charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza.

The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nThe UK restores funding to the UN agency for the Palestinians\n\nLONDON -- The new British government has overturned its predecessor's suspension of funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the Palestinians.\n\nForeign Secretary David Lammy told lawmakers that humanitarian aid in Gaza is \"a moral necessity\" and that UNRWA is \"absolutely central\" to U.K. efforts to support civilians on the ground.\n\nIn January, the previous government paused funding for UNRWA due to allegations that staff from the aid organization had been involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nLammy, who travelled to Israel last weekend and urged a ceasefire, said UNRWA is already feeding more than half of Gaza's population and that the organization will be vital for the future reconstruction of the territory.\n\nLammy said he was \"appalled\" by the allegations against UNRWA staff but having spoken to senior officials at the U.N. is \"reassured\" that the organization is meeting \"the highest standards of neutrality and strengthening its procedures.\"\n\nThe U.K., he added, will provide 21 million pounds ($27 million) in new funds.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Gaza refugee camps kill 12 overnight, Palestinian officials say\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Two Israeli strikes on central Gaza killed 12 people overnight Thursday, according to Associated Press journalists and Palestinian medical officials.\n\nSeven of the dead, including two women and three children, were killed in an airstrike on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza late Thursday evening, while the second airstrike hit Bureij refugee camp, also in central Gaza, killing five people early Friday morning, ambulance crews said.\n\nThe bodies were taken to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where they were counted by AP journalists.\n\nPalestinian militant groups call on the PLO to rescind recognition of Israel\n\nBEIRUT -- The militant Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad have called on the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization to withdraw its recognition of Israel in retaliation for a resolution approved by Israel's parliament rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nThe two groups made the announcement late Thursday following a meeting in the Gulf nation of Qatar between Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Islamic Jihad chief Ziad Nakhaleh and his deputy Mohammed al-Hindi, according to a Hamas statement.\n\nThe two groups said the Palestinian people have the right to set up their own independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nHezbollah says it fired rockets on northern Israeli village\n\nBeirut -- Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills. Hezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it aimed to ease pressure on Gaza. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed over 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members but also around 90 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels claim drone strike that hit Tel Aviv\n\nTel Aviv -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the U.S. Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted to kill civilians in Israel,\" the official said of the strike, the first to threaten Tel Aviv in months.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free

responding to a request for an advisory opinion by the General Assembly on the legal consequences arising from the policies and practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.\n\nThe advisory from the ICJ is a legal opinion provided by the Court on questions of international law.\n\nUnlike judgments in contentious cases between States, advisory opinions are non-binding and are sought by United Nations bodies such as the General Assembly or the Security Council.\n\nWhile not legally binding, advisory opinions can shape international policies, increase moral pressure, and unilateral measures adopted by individual States such as sanctions.\n\nIn its advisory opinion, the ICJ concluded that Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful and that it is under an obligation to bring to an end its unlawful presence \"as rapidly as possible\".\n\nIsrael is also \"under an obligation to cease immediately all new settlement activities and to evacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory,\" the opinion continued, as well as \"reparation for the damage caused to all natural or legal persons concerned\".\n\nIt further stated that \"all States are under an obligation not to recognize as legal the situation arising from the unlawful presence\" of Israel.\n\nStates are also under the obligation to \"not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by the continued presence of the State of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory\".\n\nFor international organizations, including the UN, the Court noted the \"obligation not to recognize as legal the situation arising from the unlawful presence\" of Israel.\n\nThe ICJ further noted that UN, and especially the General Assembly and the Security Council, \"should consider the precise modalities and further action required to bring to an end as rapidly as possible the unlawful presence of the State of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\"\n\nAccording to media reports, Israel's Foreign Ministry rejected the ICJ's opinion as \"fundamentally wrong\" and \"blatantly one-sided\".\n\nIt also repeated its stance that a political settlement in the region can only be reached through \"direct negotiations\".\n\nThe General Assembly adopted a resolution in December 2022, which among other points requested the ICJ to provide its opinion under Article 96 of the UN Charter and Article 65 of the Court's Statute.\n\nThe opinion lays out the legal consequences of Israel's \"ongoing violation\" of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of territories occupied since 1967, and discriminatory measures, including those affecting Jerusalem's demographic composition and status.\n\nIt also sought to understand how these policies and practices of Israel affect the legal status of the occupation and its legal consequences.", "source": {"uri": "news.un.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "UN News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The ruling calls for Israel to cease its occupation, immediately end its presence in Palestinian territories, halt all settlement activities, evacuate settlers, and compensate for material and moral losses inflicted on individuals in the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nThe Presidency urged the international community to compel Israel, the occupying power, to fully and immediately end its occupation and colonial project without conditions or exceptions.\n\nThe Presidency viewed the ICJ decision as a reaffirmation of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination, their land, and their statehood. It added that the ruling underscores the rejection of Israeli occupation, the recent Israeli Knesset decisions, and U.S. policies supporting Israeli occupation and rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nThe Presidency emphasized that amidst the ongoing Israeli aggression and genocide against our people in Gaza and the West Bank, including Jerusalem, the ICJ ruling renews hope among our people for a future free from colonization, on the path to achieving their absolute and non-negotiable right to self-determination and liberation.\n\nThe Presidency reiterated the necessity to end the policy of impunity, which allowed Israel to deny our Palestinian people's right to self-determination for over 76 years, perpetrate policies of apartheid, persecution, and commit genocide now being exposed to the world in Gaza and throughout the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nThe Presidency praised the positions of countries that stood by Palestinian rights, stressing the commitment of UN member states to the ICJ decision, which calls for non-recognition of the illegitimate existence of settlements in Palestinian territories by international organizations.\n\nIt called upon the UN General Assembly and the Security Council to explore additional measures to put an end to Israel's illegitimate presence in the occupied Palestinian territories.", "source": {"uri":

the biblical names for the occupied territories.\n\n(Arul Louis can be contacted at arul.l@ians.in and followed at @arulouis)", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Six-Day War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaf_Salam", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nawaf Salam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyad_al-Maliki", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riyad al-Maliki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_and_Samaria_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judea and Samaria Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?url=World+Court+declares+Israel%E2%80%99s+occupation+of+Palestine+%27unlawful%27", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745204", "eventUri": "eng-9745204", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 16, "textEnd": 23}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

The court's rather opaque provisional rulings have been widely, but falsely, used to conclude that Israel is committing genocide. Of course, it is not, and the court has not made any final rulings.\n\nAlso in The Hague, the Palestinians are pushing the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute Israeli leaders for Rome Statute crimes on Palestinian territory -- even though Israel is not a party to the Rome Statute and Palestine is not a state.\n\nAll of this \"lawfare\" in The Hague is result of a decade-long campaign driven by the Palestine Liberation Organization. Established in 1964 by the Arab states, the PLO is their vehicle to destroy the Jewish state and replace it with an Arab state from the river to the sea. The PLO remains fully committed to the use of violence to achieve the destruction of Israel. Notwithstanding former PLO President Yasser Arafat's promises made to President Clinton in 1993, the PLO has never amended its charter nor changed its mission.\n\nInstead, Arafat walked away from President Clinton's offer at Camp David of over 97 percent of the West Bank in 2000 and launched the second intifada that resulted in 1,600 Israelis murdered and 9,000 injured. Ever since, the PLO has promoted (and financially sponsored) terror against Israel.\n\nIn 2011, Arafat's successor Mahmoud Abbas announced the PLO's new strategy: to abandon negotiations with Israel and ask the international courts in The Hague to grant their demands for statehood. The first step was to mobilize states in the General Assembly to elevate Palestine to \"UN non-member observer state status\" in 2012.\n\nMost Western states abstained from voting, enabling the UN to create a virtual Palestinian state on paper that bears little resemblance to reality, but has enabled the Palestinians to operate within courts and international institutions as if it is a state.\n\nThe reality on the ground is that the Palestinians have failed to create effective institutions of government capable of ensuring the rule of law for its people and have made no effort to comply with basic international norms.\n\nHamas reigns in Gaza, while the Palestinian Authority is corrupt and ineffective at governing while openly paying terrorists. Israel's presence in the West Bank is essential to eradicate terror cells and prevent the West Bank from descending into chaos. As a result Palestine is not yet a state under the generally-accepted principles of international law.\n\nYet the request for an advisory opinion invited the court to ignore all of this, and assume that Israel's presence in the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza is illegal, that all disputed Palestinian territory belongs to the Palestinians, and that they have a unilateral right to statehood. In their submissions, the Palestinians (supported by the Islamic and Arab states) demand that Israel remove all its military personnel and civilians from the \"occupied territories\" - immediately, unconditionally and completely.\n\nThese claims not only defy reality, they are based on false legal assumptions. Israel's reunification of Jerusalem since 1967 and its administration of the West Bank are not an occupation of a nation state, nor are they illegal. East Jerusalem and the West Bank do not belong to \"the Palestinians,\" nor do they have an absolute right to statehood under international law. International law requires the parties to negotiate this complex matrix of competing rights and obligations, including Palestinian rights to autonomy and Israel's right to security.\n\nRequiring Israel to withdraw unilaterally from the West Bank and East Jerusalem - without any hard guarantees for Israel's security - would be disastrous for both Israel and the Palestinian people. Just as happened in Gaza, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) would soon take over the West Bank, and the Iranian revolutionary regime would have free rein to further extend its oppressive influence in the area.\n\nBut the Palestinians' claims at the International Court of Justice go much further. They seek a court ruling that the Jews have no national rights whatsoever, and that the establishment of a Jewish national home, pursuant to the Balfour Declaration (1917) and the Mandate for Palestine (1922) were illegal.\n\nThis would require the court to completely rewrite both history and law. It also shows that the Palestine leadership is not seeking a two-state solution, but the elimination of the Jewish state and its replacement with a Palestinian Arab state from the river to the sea from which Jews will be excluded.\n\nThe PLO is manipulating the advisory opinion process to continue its hostile lawfare campaign against Israel's existence. It is to be hoped the International Court of Justice will not give in to this pressure. The court's own reputation as trustee of fairness, due process and the rule of law is at stake.\n\nAndrew Tucker is the director general of thinc (The Hague Initiative for International Cooperation), a think tank based in the Hague that is challenging the misuse of international law to delegitimize the state of Israel and advocates the fair interpretation and application of international law.",

However, its member states can appeal to the United Nations Security Council to implement court decisions. Under such a scenario, Israel will expect the US to use it veto power.\n\nThe US administration is expected to respond positively to such a request. However, major differences are emerging between Israel and the US over the conditions for ending the Gaza war and bringing about the release of the Israeli hostages. A US veto at the UN Security Council may come at a cost of more Israeli concessions to bring about an end to the conflict in Gaza.\n\nOther western states considered friendly towards Israel are likely to stand by the court's decision, and some may even consider sanctions on Israel if it disobeys court orders.\n\nThe US and western states have recently introduced sanctions against individual settlers and radical right-wing groups, and Friday's decision is likely to lead to more punitive measures.\n\nThe World Court ruling increased Israel's sense of isolation. It joins the recent decision by prosecutor Karim Khan of the International Criminal Court in The Hague to request arrest warrants for Mr Netanyahu and defence minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nBut Israel remains defiant. The day before the ICJ ruling, the Knesset parliament affirmed its opposition to the establishment of a Palestinian state. The declarative proposal was supported by 68 right-wing and centrist members of the 120-member chamber.\n\nIsraeli finance minister Bezalel Smotrich, head of the far-right Religious Zionism party, posted on X: \"The answer to The Hague: Sovereignty now\" (referring to Israeli annexation of the West Bank). National security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, head of the far-right Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Strength), was even more outspoken. \"The decision in The Hague proves for the umpteenth time that this is a distinctly anti-Semitic and political organisation,\" he said. \"We will not accept moral preaching from them, the time has come for governance and sovereignty.\"\n\nIsrael's two far-right parties, along with many parliamentarians from Netanyahu's ruling Likud party, support annexation of the West Bank and Smotrich has been pursuing a policy of de facto annexation since he was given ministerial responsibility for West Bank civilian affairs in the current government.\n\nMany on the right also see the current war in Gaza as an opportunity to renew Jewish settlement in the area. All 21 Jewish settlements were evacuated and destroyed as part of the 2005 disengagement adopted by then prime minister Ariel Sharon.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFriday's strike came a day after Israel's far-right national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, visited Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site, a move that threatened negotiations to end the 9-month-old war in Gaza.\n\nHamas' Oct. 7 attack sparked the war when militants stormed into southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducting about 250. Since then, Israeli ground offensives and bombardments have killed more than 38,600 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count.\n\nTwo international courts have accused Israel of war crimes and genocide -- charges Israel denies. Most of Gaza's 2.3 million people are crammed into squalid tent camps in central and southern Gaza. Israeli restrictions, fighting and the breakdown of law and order have limited humanitarian aid efforts, causing widespread hunger and sparking fears of famine.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nTop UN court says Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territories is illegal and must end\n\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands -- The top United Nations court said Israel's settlement policy in the West Bank and east Jerusalem violates international law, as it delivered a non-binding advisory opinion on the legality of Israel's 57-year occupation of lands sought for a Palestinian state.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFriday's ruling by the International Court of Justice could have more effect on international opinion than it will on Israeli policies.\n\nIn a separate case, the ICJ is considering a South African claim that Israel's war in Gaza amounts to genocide, a claim that Israel vehemently denies.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek all three areas for an independent state.\n\nIsrael considers the West Bank to be disputed territory, whose future should be decided in negotiations, while it has moved population there in settlements to solidify its hold. It has annexed east Jerusalem in a move that is not internationally recognized, while it withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but maintained a blockade of the territory after Hamas took power in 2007. The international community generally considers all three areas to be occupied territory.\n\nThe UK restores funding to the UN agency for the Palestinians\n\nLONDON -- The new British government has overturned its predecessor's suspension of funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for the Palestinians.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nForeign Secretary David Lammy told lawmakers that humanitarian aid in Gaza is \"a moral necessity\" and that UNRWA is \"absolutely central\" to U.K. efforts to support civilians on the ground.\n\nIn January, the previous government paused funding for UNRWA due to allegations that staff from the aid organization had been involved in the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nLammy, who travelled to Israel last weekend and urged a ceasefire, said UNRWA is already feeding more than half of Gaza's population and that the organization will be vital for the future reconstruction of the territory.\n\nLammy said he was \"appalled\" by the allegations against UNRWA staff but having spoken to senior officials at the U.N. is \"reassured\" that the organization is meeting \"the highest standards of neutrality and strengthening its procedures.\"\n\nThe U.K., he added, will provide 21 million pounds ($27 million) in new funds.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes on Gaza refugee camps kill 12 overnight, Palestinian officials say\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Two Israeli strikes on central Gaza killed 12 people overnight Thursday, according to Associated Press journalists and Palestinian medical officials.\n\nSeven of the dead, including two women and three children, were killed in an airstrike on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza late Thursday evening, while the second airstrike hit Bureij refugee camp, also in central Gaza, killing five people early Friday morning, ambulance crews said.\n\nThe bodies were taken to al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, in the nearby city of Deir al-Balah, where they were counted by AP journalists.\n\nPalestinian militant groups call on the PLO to rescind recognition of Israel\n\nBEIRUT -- The militant Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad have called on the leadership of the Palestine Liberation Organization to withdraw its recognition of Israel in retaliation for a resolution approved by Israel's parliament rejecting the establishment of a Palestinian state.\n\nThe two groups made the announcement late Thursday following a meeting in the Gulf nation of Qatar between Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Islamic Jihad chief Ziad Nakhaleh and his deputy Mohammed al-Hindi, according to a Hamas statement.\n\nThe two groups said the Palestinian people have the right to set up their own independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.\n\nHezbollah says it fired rockets on northern Israeli village\n\nBeirut -- Lebanon's militant Hezbollah group said it fired a volley of rockets on a northern Israeli village Friday morning in retaliation for Israeli airstrikes the night before on south Lebanon that killed several Hezbollah members and wounded civilians.\n\nIn another attack, the group also said that it used for the first time a new rocket with heavy warhead to strike an Israeli army post in the disputed Kfar Chouba hills. Hezbollah said in a statement that the Wabel rocket, produced by the group in Lebanon, destroyed parts of the Rweisat al-Alam post and caused a fire inside it.\n\nHezbollah said its fighters fired a salvo of rockets on the northern Israeli village of Abirim for the first time since fighting along the Lebanon-Israel border began in early October.\n\nHezbollah began firing rockets shortly after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it aimed to ease pressure on Gaza. Since then, Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon have killed over 450 people, mostly Hezbollah members but also around 90 civilians and non-combatants. On the Israeli side, 21 soldiers and 13 civilians have been killed.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nYemen's Houthi rebels claim drone strike that hit Tel Aviv\n\nTel Aviv -- Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a drone strike early Friday that hit part of central Tel Aviv near the U.S. Embassy, killing one person and injuring 10.\n\nThe aerial strike rumbled through the streets causing shards of shrapnel to rain down and spreading shards of glass over a large radius. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles toward Israel throughout the Israel-Hamas war, in solidarity with the Palestinian people and against Israel. But until Friday, all were intercepted by either Israel or Western allies with forces stationed in the region.\n\nYahya Sare'e, the Houthis' spokesperson, said in a statement published on the social media platform X that the strike was made in retaliation for the war and had hit one of many of the group's targets.\n\nThe Houthis claimed their newest drones can bypass Israel's aerial defense systems. However, an Israeli military official on Friday that the explosive-laden drone had been identified on Thursday and attributed the hit to \"human error.\"\n\n\"It was a terror attack that was targeted

The timing of this week's opinion might seem incongruous given how much has taken place since it was first requested in January 2023. Yet it is in keeping with a wartime trend in which more new cases are being brought before international courts, and pending cases are being rekindled and amplified. Distinguishing between these cases is instructive.\n\nThe ICJ's Jurisdiction\n\nThis PolicyWatch deliberately focuses on ICJ cases, not those brought before the International Criminal Court. Although both bodies are based in The Hague, the ICC has jurisdiction over persons while the ICJ settles disputes between states.\n\nOn paper, ICJ rulings are legally binding. Yet if the disputant states choose not to comply with them, they can only be enforced through a decision by the UN Security Council (UNSC). The UN Charter also authorizes the UNSC and UNGA to ask the ICJ for nonbinding advisory opinions on matters of international law.\n\nComparing Previous Cases and Opinions\n\nThe first time the Israeli-Palestinian conflict came before the ICJ directly was in the context of the UNGA's 2003 request for an advisory opinion on the \"legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel...in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.\" Even the phrasing of the request illustrated the complex array of legal and political questions that the court had to untangle to reach a conclusion, including the status of West Bank territory, the rights of its Palestinian inhabitants, and Israel's need to protect its citizens following the second intifada. When the ICJ issued its response in 2004, it argued that the barrier was being constructed illegally. Yet the opinion was nonbinding and therefore had little impact on the ground, so construction continued.\n\nIn 2018, the ICJ saw its first contentious case on such matters when the Palestinian Authority -- acting as the \"State of Palestine,\" a non-member observer state at the UN -- challenged the Trump administration's decision to relocate the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem. Again, the court was essentially being asked to rule on a core legal question underlying the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (sovereignty over Jerusalem) in the context of a U.S. political decision to move the embassy at that particular juncture. After setting deadlines for written pleadings in 2019, however, the ICJ did not release any public information, which usually indicates that the claimant and defendant have agreed to suspend proceedings.\n\nAs mentioned above, this week's advisory opinion stems from a 2023 UNGA request regarding Israeli activities in \"Occupied Palestinian Territory,\" a phrase that would appear to exclude Gaza given Israel's 2005 withdrawal from the Strip. Yet Gaza was mentioned extensively throughout the UN resolution in question (77/247), indicating that the states supporting the ICJ request were seeking something broader: namely, confirmation of the alleged illegal character of all Israeli activity beyond the Green Line (i.e., the armistice line demarcated before the 1967 war), which would give them a basis for pressuring international actors to take action against the country.\n\nFollowing the request, Israel, the PA, and the five permanent UNSC members submitted an unusually high number of written statements (57) to the court even before the October 7 Hamas attack, reflecting a prewar atmosphere fraught with multiple rounds of violence and a new Israeli government that included far-right ministers in prominent posts. Most of these statements took one of three approaches: (1) emphasizing the alleged illegality of Israel's actions, (2) acknowledging this illegality but calling for a political process to end such actions, or (3) arguing that legal action outside a mutually agreed framework would be inappropriate and demanding direct negotiations between the parties.\n\nRegardless of what the court concludes this week, its ability to restrain Israeli activity will likely be limited given the nonbinding nature of its advisory opinions and the purely legal framing of the UNGA's questions. In fact, the opinion might even spur the Israeli government to double down on its controversial recent policies in the West Bank by extending its civil and military activity further beyond the Green Line or even instituting de jure annexations in that territory.\n\nDespite its presumably limited impact on the ground, however, this week's opinion will have notable implications for how the ICJ handles related cases going forward. This includes the tough task of balancing its 2004 opinion (which established the illegality of certain Israeli activity in the eyes of the court) with the realities of today's political context (in which the legitimacy of Israeli security interests has become glaring post-October 7 and direct negotiations remain the best path toward resolution).\n\nThe South African and Nicaraguan Cases\n\nThe most high-profile ICJ case initiated during the Gaza war is South Africa's December 2023 filing against Israel for allegedly violating the 1948 Genocide Convention -- a case that some observers have linked to the country's close diplomatic and financial links with Iran. Besides seeking an ultimate judgment on Israeli actions in Gaza, the filing also requested that provisional measures be imposed in the meantime due to urgent humanitarian concerns. In January, the court imposed a few such measures on Israel related to enabling the provision of humanitarian aid, preventing and punishing domestic incitement to genocide, and similar issues. Israel also agreed to report directly to the court about its adherence to these orders; these reports have not been made public.\n\nLater, South Africa submitted three more requests to impose additional provisional measures and modify existing ones, citing Israel's military campaign in Rafah and other new developments. The court dismissed these requests, however, noting that Israel had complied with the original reporting request. As for the wider question of whether Israel's actions in Gaza constitute genocide in the court's legal view, final judgment is unlikely to be delivered anytime soon.\n\nShortly after the South African case emerged, Nicaragua initiated similar proceedings against Germany, accusing it of failing to comply with the 1948 Convention's obligation to \"do everything possible to prevent the commission of genocide\" during the Gaza war. The filing emphasized Germany's \"political, financial, and military support to Israel\" and its decision to suspend funding to the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). Nicaragua also requested provisional measures, but the court ruled in April that these were unnecessary given the measures already established in the South African case. Yet a final judgment on the merits can still be expected at some point, despite Germany's request to dismiss the case.\n\nLaw or Lawfare?\n\nTaken together, these ICJ cases and the host of other proceedings before the ICC and various national courts represent a major increase in international legal involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian arena. These cases also seem more heavily politicized than in the past -- hardly surprising given the lack of meaningful Israeli-Palestinian political negotiations for a decade, worsening conditions on the ground for Palestinians, and Israel's expanding settlement policy (facilitated in previous years by the Trump administration's proposals regarding future disposition of the West Bank). The parties bringing these cases tend to frame them with abstract legal concepts, expecting that universal opposition to practices like genocide will help garner international support. Clearly, this approach does not account for the many complexities on the ground, but the claimants seem well aware of this fact -- more often than not, they appear to see ICJ proceedings as a lever for swaying global political opinion rather than a means of affecting Israel's actions in any immediate sense.\n\nEven so, it would be unwise to dismiss these legal developments in The Hague as irrelevant or fatally politicized. Instead, officials should follow the model established by the United States and other actors: continuing to engage with international legal proceedings while simultaneously exposing their limits. If governments acknowledge the reasoning behind a given ICJ complaint or judgment and then explain their reasons for opposing it, they can boost perceptions of their policies both abroad and domestically. In contrast, simply discarding the concept of global justice is risky -- not only because it could lead to an (even more) unruly world, but also because most states will likely find themselves in future situations where they need to refer cases of their own to international judges.\n\nIn this respect, Nicaragua's case against Germany is remarkable. Berlin has previously accepted the ICJ's compulsory jurisdiction as part of its post-World War II adherence to international law, yet it now finds itself being singled out and sued for discretionary foreign policy choices that other parties to the Genocide Convention have made toward Israel. Those who initiated the case may be more interested in eroding the ICJ's legitimacy than winning a judgment against Berlin. If so, the correct reaction is to avoid the trap by participating in the case and explaining why the accusation is without merit.\n\nOf course, efforts to address the problems facing Israelis and Palestinians on the ground are still paramount. Despite making headlines and convincing Israel to comply with certain provisional measures during the Gaza war, the ICJ's proceedings are unlikely to have much effect on this primary mission. Advisory opinions like the one issued this week are nonbinding, and the United States would presumably veto any attempt to enforce judgments against Israel through the UNSC. Yet the debate surrounding how international courts engage with the Israeli-Palestinian question could easily exacerbate polarization worldwide if governments mishandle or ignore it.\n\nDr. Alexander Loengarov is a visiting fellow with the international law department at KU Leuven (Belgium) and a former official at the European Economic and Social Committee.

of Justice (ICJ) rejecting the Israeli occupation's settlement policies and its exploitation of natural resources in the occupied territories and considering it a violation of international law, stressing that it is a victory for justice.\n\nThe Presidency stressed, in a statement, the need for the Israeli entity to stop its occupation and end its presence in the Palestinian territories, stop practicing any settlement activity, evacuate the settlements, and compensate for the material and moral losses of people in the occupied territories, calling on the international community to oblige it to end its occupation and colonial project completely, immediately, and without restriction or condition.\n\nIt considered the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which affirmed the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and their right to their land and state, a rejection of the occupation and the recent \"Knesset\" decision, pointing out that this decision comes at a time when the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank are being exposed to comprehensive aggression and genocide, which renews The Palestinians have hope for a future free of colonialism on the path to achieving their absolute and non-negotiable right to self-determination and liberation.\n\nIt also reiterated the need to end the policy of impunity that allowed the Israeli occupation to deny the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination for more than 76 years, entrench the policies of apartheid and persecution, and commit the crime of genocide that is now unfolding before the world in Gaza and throughout the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) had confirmed, earlier Friday, that the settlement policies of the Israeli occupation and its exploitation of natural resources in the occupied territories violate international law, adding that it could express an opinion regarding its occupation of the Palestinian territories.", "source": {"uri": "thepeninsulaqatar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peninsula"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type":

That opinion simply declared the barrier illegal, and an impediment to the Palestinian people's right to self-determination. Israel ignored it and its Western allies have refrained from enforcing it.\n\nIn today's Advisory Opinion, the court re-enunciated the illegality of Israel's settlement enterprise under the Fourth Geneva Convention, and confirmed the applicability of Geneva IV, the two Covenants on Civil, Political, Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) outside Israel's internationally recognized territory (Israel denies they apply).\n\nSidestepping the legal consequences of Israel's assault on Gaza (deemed plausibly genocidal in its entirely different provisional measures orders against Israel), the court confirmed that Gaza's status as an integral part of the occupied territories -- and Israel's status as occupying power -- preceded the events of October 7.\n\nToday's ruling is the court's response to a request for an Advisory Opinion on the 'Legal Consequences arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem', and on how those policies and practices affect the \"legal status\" of Israel's occupation, referred to it late last year by the UN General Assembly, in a resolution Israel and its Western allies moved heaven and Earth to stave off.\n\nIn his letter to the ICJ informing it of the Advisory Opinion request, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres asked the ICJ to address \"the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, from its prolonged occupation, settlement and annexation of the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 ... and from its adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures.\"\n\nReference to \"discriminatory legislation and measures\" in the General Assembly's Advisory Opinion request opened the door for the court to opine on the question of Israeli apartheid.\n\nAnd it did, crucially citing Article 3 of the 1965 Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and Apartheid (CERD), in which apartheid is specifically prohibited - the first such prohibition, predating the 1976 Apartheid Convention.\n\n\"The Court observes that Israel's legislation and measures impose and serve to maintain a near-complete separation in the West Bank and East Jerusalem between the settler and Palestinian communities,\" today's Advisory Opinion says. \"For this reason, the Court considers that Israel's legislation and measures constitute a breach of Article 3 of CERD.\"\n\n\"I think the finding of a breach of Article 3 is hugely significant,\" Irish legal scholar David Keane told Mondoweiss following the ruling.\n\nStill, Keane points out, a breach of Article 3 could refer to racial segregation or apartheid, or both. Several judges brought up the Article 3 breach in individual declarations, without specifying apartheid.\n\nSouth African Judge Dire Tladi did.\n\n\"I interpret this finding to be an acceptance that the policies and practices of Israel constitute a breach of the prohibition of apartheid,\" Judge Tladi wrote.\n\n\"I can understand that there is a reluctance to describe the policies of Israel in the OPT as apartheid. I suspect the main reason for this hesitation is that, to date, only the policies of the pre-1994 South African government in South Africa and elsewhere in Southern Africa have been described as apartheid ... [It] is hard not to see that Israeli policies, legislation and practices involve widespread discrimination against Palestinians in nearly all aspects of life much like the case in apartheid South Africa.\"\n\nThe court's ruling on CERD Article 3, albeit nuanced, comes at an opportune moment. For the past six years, the CERD committee has been addressing an 'Inter-State Complaint' lodged by Palestine against Israel, claiming Israel to be in breach of Article 3. The complaint has been idling in 'conciliation' mode for over a year. Israel has refused to participate. Today's court reference to an Article 3 breach promises to accelerate CERD.\n\n\"The Advisory Opinion does provide CERD with a platform to make an individuated decision on the issue of apartheid,\" David Keane told Mondoweiss.\"\n\nGiven the complexity of the questions put to it by the UN General Assembly, the ICJ has responded quickly.\n\nIn early January, UN Secretary General Guterres handed over 15,000 pages of UN reports and resolutions to the court, documenting the full spectrum of Israeli practices over 57 years of Israeli military occupation.\n\nFive days of public hearings were held in mid-February.\n\nIsrael's breaches of international law are extensive and egregious, the UN top court was told, in oral pleadings and written statements filed by 57 UN member states and three organizations - the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the African Union -- the largest number ever to argue a case before the ICJ.\n\nThe core question put to the court: Has Israel's presence in the OPT crossed the line between lawful occupation, as defined and regulated under the 1907 Hague and 1949 Geneva Conventions, and the \"inadmissible acquisition of territory by war\" - i.e. annexation?\n\nYes, an increasing number of legal authorities have stated in recent years.\n\nIn a Fall 2017 report to the UN Human Rights Council, then Special Rapporteur Michael Lynk put forward a four-part test for the legality of an occupation. Israel failed, Lynk declared: a) by annexing portions of the territory it occupied in June 1967 (East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights); b) by failing to return the territory to sovereign Palestinian rule in a reasonable amount of time; c) by failing to act in the best interests of the Palestinian people (referred to under the Fourth Geneva Convention as a 'protected people'; and by failing to act in good faith, \"in full compliance with its duties and obligations under international law,\" and as a UN member state.\n\nAnd, Lynk and others argued before the ICJ this past February, the ICJ has established a precedent on this matter.\n\nIn its 1971 opinion on the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa), the court ruled that South Africa had \"abused the terms of its trusteeship,\" that its occupation was therefore \"illegal,\" and that the Apartheid regime was obliged to \"withdraw its administration from Namibia immediately and thus put an end to its occupation of the Territory.\"\n\nHaving failed to stave off an Advisory Opinion resolution at the UN, Israel's allies had urged the court to decline to render one, even if the request was admissible and within the court's jurisdiction; doing so would muck up the 'peace process', a bilateral dispute best resolved by the parties themselves; if it did render an opinion, to frame its opinion in the most narrow way possible, distancing itself from complex root causes, going back a century, based on over 15,000 pages of documents provided to it by the General Assembly that the court hasn't the capacity to assess.\n\nThe Court dismissed these arguments in today's ruling.\n\nWhile continuing to seek a just and peaceful resolution to the so-called 'conflict, the ICJ ruled today, the international community must hold Israel accountable for its wrongful acts.\n\nThe \"precise modalities to bring to an end Israel's unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is a matter to be dealt with by the General Assembly, which requested this opinion, as well as the Security Council,\" today's Advisory Opinion states. \"[It] is for the General Assembly and the Security Council to consider what further action is required to put an end to the illegal presence of Israel, taking into account the present Advisory Opinion.\"\n\nHowever, today's Advisory Opinion emphasizes, \"all States are under an obligation not to recognize as legal the situation arising from the unlawful presence of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. They are also under an obligation not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel's illegal presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It is for all States, while respecting the Charter of the United Nations and international law, to ensure that any impediment resulting from the illegal presence of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to the exercise of the Palestinian people of its right to self-determination is brought to an end.\"\n\n\"I think it's a really historic ruling,\" says Julia Pinzauti, a legal scholar at Leiden University, who teaches a course about the ICJ. \"And,\" Pinzauti told Mondoweiss, \"given how blatantly illegal Israeli practices are, I think the ICJ couldn't have reached any other conclusion.\"\n\n\"[It's] the culmination of years and years of work, especially by Palestinian human rights organizations,\" Pinzauti says. \"Ultimately, whether these rulings will make a difference or not in terms of ending an illegal occupation and saving lives and ending apartheid and discriminatory practices and measures that impede the Palestinian people's right to self-determination, it really depends on third states and international organizations.\"\n\n\"This will now be a centerpiece of virtually every General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolution from now on,\" former UN Special Rapporteur Michael Lynk told Mondoweiss, in anticipation of the ruling, a few days prior.\n\n\"The word 'illegal' will be in front of 'occupation' from now on,\" says Lynk. Israel's war on Gaza has deepened Israel's isolation, says Lynk. \"A ruling of this sort coming from the International Court of Justice will, I think, only accelerate that kind of isolation.\"\n\nDavid Kattenburg\n\nDavid Kattenburg is a university science instructor and radio/web journalist based in Breda, North Brabant, the Netherlands.", "source": {"uri": "mondoweiss.net",

The court specifically aimed to provide its view on Israel's policies and practices as well as the legal status of the settlements, the BBC reported.\n\nThe court in May demanded Israel \"immediately halt its military offensive\" against Hamas in Rafah, the Palestinian terrorist group's final stronghold in the Gaza Strip.\n\nWASHINGTON POST DELETES 'UNACCEPTABLE' POST SCOLDING AMERICAN HOSTAGE PARENTS FOR NOT BEING CRITICAL OF ISRAEL\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly rejected the court's conclusion, arguing in a statement posted on X that \"Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land, including in our eternal capital Jerusalem nor in Judea and Samaria, our historic homeland.\n\n\"No absurd opinion in The Hague can deny this historical truth or the legal right of Israelis to live in their own communities in our ancestral home.\"\n\nThe Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a longer, more detailed statement through its spokesperson Oren Marmorstein, who posted on social media platform X that \"Israel rejects the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that was published today regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\"\n\nDEADLY EXPLOSION IN TEL AVIV LEAVES ONE DEAD, MORE WOUNDED\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Court's opinion is fundamentally wrong,\" Marmorstein wrote. \"It mixes politics and law.

Incredibly, the court openly states it didn't need to find any specific facts in violation of international law before reaching its conclusions, including before making the slanderous claim that Israel is guilty of the crime against humanity of apartheid.

They're drinking coffee while coffee shops in Tel Aviv closed due to terror. While they were drinking their espressos on Friday morning, ahead of a useless hearing, missiles were sent from Lebanon towards Israeli towns, and Hamas kept on hiding 120 Israeli hostages in their underground tunnels.\n\nIt's in this serene environment that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has declared Israeli settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem illegal under international law. ICJ judges, are you genuinely supporting a terrorist organization with this ruling?\n\nLet's start with the glaring omissions. The ICJ conveniently forgets the historical and legal mess that is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The West Bank and east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War -- a defensive conflict, mind you -- have never been sovereign Palestinian territories. But why bother with such details when you can make sweeping declarations from the comfort of The Hague? Do you prefer your judgments to be based on convenience rather than facts?\n\nThe ICJ also seems to have a selective memory regarding security concerns. Israeli settlements act as crucial buffers against the kind of aggressions that tend to happen when your neighbors aren't exactly sending you fruit baskets. Judea and Samaria have been a breeding ground for terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. Suggesting that Israel dismantle these settlements without any security guarantees is like telling someone to take off their bulletproof vest in the middle of a shootout. Do you believe Israel should compromise its security for a romantic fantasy? Advertisement\n\nAnd then there's the historical connection. The Jewish ties to east Jerusalem, home to the holiest sites in Judaism, stretch back thousands of years. But the ICJ waves this off as if it's an annoying pop-up ad. Reducing millennia of Jewish presence to a mere political squabble is an insult to history and common sense. Are you seriously that dismissive of a people's ancient heritage?\n\nWhy is the ICJ making its opinion known now?\n\nThe timing of this opinion is as impeccable as ever. It predates the current Israel-Hamas conflict but was delivered amidst heightened tensions. It's almost as if the ICJ wanted to pour gasoline on a fire. Funny how that works. Are you deliberately trying to escalate the situation?\n\nThe UN General Assembly's request to the ICJ is just another chapter in its long history of anti-Israel bias. Israel gets condemned by UN bodies more often than a bad restaurant on Yelp. This consistent targeting undermines the credibility of the UN and, by extension, the ICJ. But who needs credibility when you have politics? Do you enjoy turning severe legal matters into a circus?\n\nThe ICJ's ruling is just the latest example of the Western world's favorite pastime: abandoning Israel when it's most convenient. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Western nations took their sweet time sending support while Israel faced coordinated attacks. It was only after significant casualties that aid finally showed up. Thanks a lot. Is it acceptable to delay aid until the damage is done? Then, in 2015, the West couldn't sign the Iran Nuclear Deal fast enough, ignoring Israel's legitimate security concerns. Prioritizing appeasement over real threats to Israel's existence -- what could go wrong? Are you comfortable with empowering regimes that openly call for Israel's destruction?\n\nThe 2016 UN Security Council Resolution 2334 is another classic example. The Obama administration's abstention on a resolution declaring Israeli settlements a violation of international law was another instance where political convenience triumphed over standing by your allies. Do you believe that abandoning allies is a sound strategy? And who could forget the Durban Conference in 2001? What was supposed to be a conference on racism turned into an anti-Israel bash-fest, with Western countries doing little to stop the madness. It set the stage for the one-sided judgment we see today from the ICJ. Do you condone such biased spectacles under the guise of international diplomacy? Advertisement\n\nThese instances show a disturbing trend: when political winds change, the West is quick to throw Israel under the bus, prioritizing short-term gains over a balanced approach to Middle eastern peace and security. Do you not see the dangerous precedent this sets for global diplomacy?\n\nThe ICJ's advisory opinion on Israeli settlements is less about law and more about politics. It dismisses the historical, security, and legal complexities of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, reinforcing international biases against Israel. True peace requires direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, free from external pressures and biased judicial opinions. Until then, can we expect more of the same old, same old from the ICJ and its ilk?", "source": {"uri": "m.jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post | JPost.com"}, "authors": [],

They declared that settlements are illegal and must be dismantled, and all settlers must be removed from Palestinian territory.\"\n\n\"This means that Israel is obligated to end its colonial project immediately and unconditionally, and it is the duty of the international community to take all necessary measures to end the occupation,\" he continued.\n\nAl-Maliki further emphasized that the ICJ found the Israeli occupation to be illegal, violating the UN Charter, human rights, and international humanitarian law, including particularly the prohibition of apartheid.\n\nHe stressed that the ICJ's decision at this moment supports the resilience of the Palestinian people and instills hope for a future free from colonization. This comes at a time when our people in Gaza are facing severe genocide, defending their absolute and non-negotiable right to liberation from colonization.\n\nAl-Maliki concluded by condemning the continued Israeli occupation as rooted in policies of racial segregation, political and cultural persecution, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.\n\nThese policies, said the President's adviser, have enabled Israel to deny the Palestinian people their right to self-determination for over 76 years, prolonging their suffering through impunity, which has allowed Israel to commit genocide now exposed before the world in Gaza and throughout occupied Palestinian territories.", "source": {"uri": "wafa.ps", "dataType": "news", "title": "WAFA Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyad_al-Maliki", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riyad al-Maliki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Abbas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Abbas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charter of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartheid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International humanitarian law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crimes against humanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Occupational_Hygiene", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Occupational Hygiene", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745204", "eventUri": "eng-9745204", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 19, "textEnd": 26}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

The Court ordered the removal of all illegal Israeli settlers from the occupied territories of Palestine and the payment of reparations by Israel to the Palestinians.\n\nThe Scottish Greens have now called for the UK Government to take action including sanctions against all Israeli political, military and business figures involved in the illegal occupation of Palestine and the ongoing genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.\n\nRoss Greer MSP said:\n\n\"This ruling is a damning indictment of Israel's actions over the last six decades - and of countries like the UK who have armed, enabled and protected Israel as it carried out this brutal campaign of occupation and apartheid.

The court has placed responsibility with all states and the United Nations to end these violations of international law.

It is our duty to stand with them and to stand up for the rule of law,\" she added.\n\nMeanwhile, Christian Aid Ireland's Head of Policy & Advocacy Conor O'Neill said the ICJ ruling \"must mark a turning point for Ireland and other EU states\".\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added that the ruling \"makes clear that the international community cannot just sit by - states have a clear obligation to ensure they do not provide any recognition, aid or assistance to this illegal situation, and the occupation must end\".\n\nO'Neill called on Ireland to \"take heed of this ICJ opinion and lead by example\" and that Ireland must, at EU level, \"push for the suspension of the EU-Israel trade agreement\".\n\nThat EU agreement \"aims to provide an appropriate legal and institutional framework for political dialogue and economic cooperation between the EU and Israel\".\n\nO'Neill added that the government should pass the Occupied Territories Bill - the Bill seeks to prevent Ireland from trading in goods and services imported from Israeli-occupied territories.\n\nElsewhere, Sinn F\u00e9in leader Mary Lou McDonald said the ruling \"intensifies the legal and moral responsibility of the international community to help bring the occupation to an end\".\n\nShe added that \"arming Israel, as it commits war crimes, flies in the face of that objective\".\n\nMcDonald also called for the Irish Government to enact the Occupied Territories Bill, as well as the Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill.\n\nThe Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill seeks to impose \"prohibitions and restrictions\" on the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) in dealings with any entities that appear on a UN Database of companies operating in illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land.\n\nThe Ireland-Palestine Solidarity Campaign also welcomed the decision and its chairperson Zoe Lawlor said the Irish Government must \"act now to end this continued criminal oppression of the Palestinian people\".\n\nShe said this includes enacting the Occupied Territories Bill and the Illegal Israeli Settlement Divestment Bill, as well as ending the use of Shannon Airport and Irish airspace by the US Military and breaking all diplomatic relations with Israel.\n\nReaders like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

This case is separate from the genocide case brought by South Africa.\n\nHere is the ICJ press release.\n\nhttps://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/186/186-20240712-pre-01-00-en.pdf", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_the_West_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli occupation of the West Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Line_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Line (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745204", "eventUri": "eng-9745204", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 93, "relevance": 1}

The group called for \"immediate\" international action to end the occupation, asserting that the opinion compels the international community to act swiftly.\n\nHowever, Israel rejected the ICJ's ruling. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in a press release on Friday that \"the legality of Israeli settlements in all the territories of our homeland cannot be contested.\" Netanyahu emphasised Israel's historical connection to the land, describing the Jewish people as \"not conquerors in their own land,\" and referred to annexed East Jerusalem as part of Israel's \"eternal capital.\" Foreign Minister Israel Katz criticised the opinion as \"one-sided and wrong,\" and the Israeli foreign ministry reiterated that the advisory opinion is non-binding and that Israel is not obliged to adopt it. The ministry affirmed Israel's commitment to international law.\n\nIn contrast, Egypt and the Arab League welcomed the ICJ's call to end Israel's \"unlawful\" presence in the occupied Palestinian territories. Egypt's foreign ministry urged all international parties to uphold and implement the ICJ's advisory opinion, emphasising the need to support Palestinian self-determination. Egypt also called on the UN General Assembly and Security Council to take measures to end Israel's presence in Palestinian territories, stressing the international community's responsibility to alleviate Palestinian suffering and halt Israeli violations in Gaza.\n\nSecretary-General of the League of Arab States, Ahmed Aboul-Gheit, echoed Egypt's sentiments, welcoming the ICJ's opinion. In a statement, Aboul-Gheit said the court's opinion provides crucial legal legitimacy to the Palestinian narrative and counteracts Israel's attempts to distort the nature and origins of the conflict. He highlighted the advisory opinion's legal and moral significance as evidence to challenge Israeli arguments.\n\nThe ICJ issued its advisory opinion following a request from the UN General Assembly, which adopted a resolution in December 2022 seeking the court's view on the legal implications of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem. Israel has controlled the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip since the 1967 Middle East war, despite ongoing international opposition to its occupation of these areas.", "source": {"uri": "dailynewsegypt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News Egypt"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israeli settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-determination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-determination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arab League"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annexation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations General Assembly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary-General_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secretary-General of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://d1b3667xvzs6rz.cloudfront.net/2024/07/ICJ-israel.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745204", "eventUri": "eng-9745204", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 459184187, "relevance": 2}

{"id": 237081730, "title": "Another Mosquito Larvicide Drop Planned This Month in Tijuana River Valley", "text": "San Diego County officials will conduct an aerial larvicide drop on about 50 rivers, streams, ponds and other waterways in the Tijuana River Valley as part of efforts to limit mosquito breeding in the area, it was announced Monday. The larvicide drops will be conducted via helicopter on June 26 and 27, marking the second round of such aerial drops in the area this month. County officials said the larvicide drops are a precautionary measure after standing water \u2014 which can support mosquito breeding \u2014 was discovered in the region. According to the county, the larvicide will not harm people or pets, but will kill mosquito larvae before they can grow into adults and spread diseases such as West Nile virus. No local West Nile virus cases in humans have been reported this year, but some mosquitoes and birds did test positive for the virus. Along with aerial drops, vector control crews have been conducting surveillance of mosquitoes and larvicide treatments by ground. County officials advised residents to help prevent mosquito breeding by dumping or removing any items that can hold water and to obtain mosquito fish, which are given out for free by county officials. Mosquito fish distribution centers are listed at www.sandiegocounty.gov. \u201cWe\u2019re at the peak of mosquito season right now, so we all need to be proactive and take measures to prevent exposure to mosquitoes,\u201d said John-Ross Glueck, interim director of the county\u2019s Environmental Health Division. \u201cIn addition to the county\u2019s diligent vector control efforts, people can make a difference at home or work.\u201d To report mosquito activity or request a mosquito inspection from the county, contact the Vector Control Program at 858-694-2888 or vector@sdcounty.ca.gov.

Do they have kids? And then you\u2019d leave a letter and then you\u2019d go and look at the house.\u201d While working on Rob Reiner\u2019s Ghosts of Mississippi (1996), Balton detected the perfect SoCal home to stand in for the Old South. \u201cIn Sierra Madre, I passed this house and I just stepped on the brakes, backed up, and I was like, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s it,\u2019 \u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was this old farmhouse that was still there, and I shot it. And when I came back, everyone was so amazed. We shot the whole thing there, exterior and interior.\u201d The home fooled even natives of the state. \u201cEven people from Mississippi were calling to ask, \u2018Where in Mississippi is that house?\u2019 \u201d she says with a laugh. Nowadays, privacy hedges and fences have made searching for locations in the L.A. area a lot harder. Luckily, the internet has stepped in to fill the void, in both positive and negative ways. \u201cProducers use it and think they can do our job. They\u2019ll send me links to 27 houses and all of them are wrong,\u201d says Balton. \u201cBut because it\u2019s coming from the producer, I have to follow up on all of them. So, it\u2019s a big time suck.\u201d But it can also be a godsend. \u201cWhen I was working on Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, it was a very specific geography with how the driveway related to the pool and how that shot was going to run,\u201d Balton says. \u201cI used Google Earth for almost all my scouting to find a driveway with a pool.\u201d As for her favorite interiors, open floor plans, which can be shot to look like separate rooms, are a perennial favorite. \u201cI like a bigger house that we can make feel small, because if it\u2019s a house that\u2019s too small, you can never make it feel big,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got an awful lot of equipment that has to fit inside.\u201d The next step is to convince homeowners to rent out their house \u2014 a tricky proposition given perennial worries about loud crews, broken furniture and scraped walls. Even Balton admits she was wary when she was approached by a location manager about filming in her own house. \u201cI thought, \u2018She\u2019s never going to shoot here, so sure, take a look,\u2019 \u201d Balton says. \u201cThey ended up wanting to shoot there, and my first reaction \u2014 to myself \u2014 was, \u2018Fuck no. I don\u2019t want people in my house.\u2019 Then I said, \u2018Come on, you talk people into this every day, you have to.\u2019 And it was a great experience.\u201d Actress and acting coach Holly Gagnier had no such qualms when it became clear that her storybook 1926 Tudor in Toluca Lake was ideal for filming. And she wasn\u2019t concerned about potential for damage. \u201cI\u2019ve worked so much that I know what sticklers they were for us not touching certain things, not using the bathrooms. I\u2019ve really seen it firsthand, unless it\u2019s just some crappy crew,\u201d she says. \u201cThe location was often treated better than the actors, probably because they were paying so much more for it.\u201d Today, those payments average a minimum of $5,000 to $6,000 per day on shoot days. As an added bonus, prep days are paid and if production rents your home for under fourteen days, the income is tax free. \u201cWe try to give you roughly around what your mortgage payment would be a day,\u201d Balton says. \u201cAnd if it\u2019s something that\u2019s an extraordinary, unique house in some way that they really like, then you can get more money for it.\u201d Indeed, Douglas Elliman real estate agent Juliette Hohnen used her negotiation skills when a film crew wanted to rent out the large garden of her Bel-Air home while they shot on her street. She turned down the first offer. \u201cBeing the real estate agent that I am, I said, \u2018We will do it for double that.\u2019 [And] why wouldn\u2019t I do it? It\u2019s free money. It was a major windfall. I bought new windows, which I\u2019ve been meaning to do for 20 years!\u201d That sort of potential windfall has led many homeowners to sign up with location agents like Home Shoot Home, CAST Locations, Universal Locations and On Location Inc., or online listing services like Gigster, Scouty and Set Scouter. When actor Brian Lally signed up his classic Cape Cod with Toni Maier & Team of On Location, Inc., he often found himself waiting to see if his home had been picked. \u201cIt\u2019s funny because we\u2019re actors,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it was our house that would be up for the job.\u201d For longer shoots, productions will often put homeowners up in hotels. For shorter shoots, there is the lure of stargazing, excitement \u2014 and unlimited snacks. \u201cMy daughter Grace and I knew when to go in and out when they\u2019d say cut, and we\u2019d go out the back door,\u201d Gagnier says. \u201cIt was really fun because they give you craft services. They let you in on all the meals. Grace loved it. There\u2019s a table there with candy all day long. She\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my god, I can eat whatever I want! Ice cream, cookies.'\u201d Seeing the strange things production does to dress your home can also be bewildering. For one commercial, Gagnier\u2019s house needed to look dreary and sad. \u201cI had a huge tree in my front yard. It was the beginning of spring, so it was just getting its leaves. They snipped all the leaves off of it,\u201d she says. \u201cThey paid the gardener three grand to snip the leaves off the entire tree.\u201d For Hollywood professionals renting your home can also lead to unexpected surprises. \u201cI got a cold knock from the Jay Leno show. I ended up being in the sketch,\u201d says Gagnier. \u201cIt was about fixing my washer and dryer. And then when they met me, they\u2019re like, \u2018Are you an actress?\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018Do you want to be in the \u2026 sketch? We fix something in your house.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Sure.\u2019\u201d Of course, disruptions pertaining to a shoot can and often do annoy neighbors, but they can be placated. \u201cLocation managers rent people\u2019s driveways to prevent things like that,\u201d says Balton. \u201cWe try to spread the wealth around. We\u2019ll send fruit baskets or gift cards to people, especially if we\u2019re going to be there for multiple days. The most important thing I find is that you communicate early and often.\u201d Hohnen notes that whenever a neighbor had a problem with production, they quickly took care of it. \u201cI just shared the location manager\u2019s number with everybody and anytime they had a concern, they would call him. He would answer it immediately and deal with it immediately,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, they couldn\u2019t really complain.\u201d Despite all the pluses, light fixtures and sprinklers run the risk of being broken (they will be replaced) and it can be shocking to see your home repainted a color you hate \u2014 though the production will always paint it back. Occasionally, a shady clause will end up costing a homeowner money. For example, Lally was shocked when production once brought in an above-ground pool and filled the water with his hose \u2014 resulting in a massive water bill. Gagnier says she has learned to treat her home like an Airbnb when a production is there, no matter how much she trusts them. \u201cI still had all of my really nice stuff locked away in a closet. Look, we just live in a world where you can\u2019t be in every room at all times,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you have a Ming vase or something, get it out of there.\u201d But the annoyance is minimal, and often production is gone as quickly as it came. Lally, whose classic Cape Cod home has been used in music videos, Disney shows, and commercials for Southern Bell, Bud Light, Toyota and Geico, recalls the magic of watching crews clear in and out like a carnival on a one-day gig. \u201cThey would get there at 6 a.m. and I\u2019d look out the second-floor window and they would start to bring equipment. And then within an hour or so, there was a whole company of people down there,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s just 40 people running around doing their job in your yard, and it\u2019s packed with trucks and equipment and everything. And then you look out the window at 10 p.m. and they\u2019re gone. They don\u2019t leave a thing behind.\u201d No wonder some people are even building homes specifically to be shoot-friendly. According to Hohnen, one client, a photographer, turned their Tarzana house into a Grecian wonderland and reaped the benefits when they sold it 10 years later. \u201cWe sold it for a very good price, a great profit, because it was basically a shoot house, and it was on a big enough lot that it didn\u2019t annoy other people.\u201d A version of this story first appeared in the June 5 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

Fry, only one word can describe the decision he's had to make: agonizing.\n\nThe Brooklyn native who got his start in academia at the University of Pennsylvania has led Drexel University in West Philadelphia for 14 years, more than twice the average tenure of a college president. And now, in a remarkable move, he has decided to cross town to North Philadelphia to become Temple's next president. Temple's board of trustees is expected to vote on his candidacy at 10 a.m. Wednesday.\n\nFry spent last weekend calling 150 Drexel board members and donors so he could personally explain his reasons for leaving: He was attracted to Temple's historic mission of making education widely available at an accessible price, its deep commitment to first-generation and underrepresented students, and the embrace of its position as Philadelphia's public university.\n\n\" READ MORE: As Temple's next president, John Fry says safety will be 'an early priority'\n\n\"This is not a moment of elation for me,\" Fry, 64, said during an exclusive interview this week. \"This is ... difficult... On the one hand, I'm looking forward to leading this great, amazing university, and on the other hand, I already lead a great, amazing university. So it's poignant. The thing that gives me a lot of comfort though is staying in Philadelphia.\"\n\nFry has already put a lot of thought into the new job: Campus safety, which has been a challenge for Temple in recent years, will be an \"early priority,\" he said. He also envisions a focus on commercial development, similar to the work he's done near Drexel and earlier at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, where he served as president from 2002 to 2010. He sees the potential in Temple's vast research enterprise to spur a \"North Philadelphia innovation corridor,\" running up Broad Street from Temple's main campus to its health system campus about a mile-and-a-half away.\n\nHe also cited the importance of Temple's athletic program, which he sees as \"the gateway\" to the university for many people; its hospital and health system, which serves many of the city's low-income residents; and relationships with faculty and its unions and the university's North Philadelphia neighbors.\n\n\" READ MORE: College president as urban planner\n\n\"I feel like if Temple can position itself as a constructive, unifying force among neighbors as a neighbor, that would be a terrific thing,\" he said. \"Work needs to be done there, starting with really deep listening and understanding about what neighborhood interests, issues and needs are.\"\n\nFry said he's prepared to do that. But his work at Temple won't start, he said, until Drexel finds a new president. Drexel is expected to launch a search this week.\n\n\"My commitment to the [Drexel] board is to stay while they run a search,\" Fry said. \"I'm not going to shortchange my transition from Drexel. I need to make sure we find a great new person.\"\n\nHe declined to estimate a timeline, but said he likely won't start at Temple until after the new academic year is underway.\n\nWhile many new presidents hesitate to say much at all about their early priorities, wanting time to learn about their new environment, Fry has had the benefit of proximity to Temple, with decades spent in the city.\n\nAnd although Temple is a state-related school and Drexel is private, they are both high-level research universities serving large enrollments -- Drexel at about 21,700, while Temple is 30,530.\n\nFor Temple, Fry is the clear choice, said Mitchell L. Morgan, the university's board of trustees' chair.\n\n\"He is a proven leader,\" Morgan said. \"He is a team builder. People love working with him. He's smart. He can think on his feet. He's got it all.\"\n\nThe university started its search by listening extensively to what its campus community wanted, and Morgan said repeatedly they cited experience, \"a known commodity.\" When he asked them for a name that fit the description, at least a half-dozen times the response was \"someone like a John Fry,\" Morgan said.\n\nShohreh Amini, a biology professor, president of the faculty senate and member of the search committee, said Fry was the unanimous choice of the committee. She liked that Fry was interested in every aspect of the job and knows Philadelphia well.\n\n\"He can get up and running the first day,\" she said.\n\n\" READ MORE: From best band to current read, John Fry answers some personal questions\n\nFry, Morgan said, has been on his radar for a while; he reached out to Fry before the last presidential search about four years ago and Fry wasn't interested, citing his loyalty to Drexel. When The Inquirer wrote about Fry's candidacy last week, Morgan said he received about 150 messages, all positive, including a call from Gov. Josh Shapiro and an email from a prominent alumnus who wrote: \"Greatest pick since Chamberlain!!!,\" referring, of course, to Wilt.\n\nBut Morgan said he also understood Fry's loyalty to Drexel -- \"this is not the Mets vs. the Phillies\" -- and he's supportive of Fry continuing to help Drexel transition, even after he starts at Temple.\n\nFry has been offered a five-year contract, but has said he would like to stay 10, which he sees as necessary for meaningful progress. He would replace Richard M. Englert, who has been president since JoAnne A. Epps died in September while serving as acting president.\n\nTemple does not plan to release Fry's salary until it is legally required in tax forms, Morgan said. At Drexel, Fry earned $2.6 million in total compensation in 2021, including $765,000 in base pay and the rest in bonuses, benefits, and deferred compensation, which he received after he completed a five-year contract. In 2022, his total compensation was about $2.2 million, with a base salary of more than $886,000.\n\nJason Wingard, the former Temple president who resigned after less than two years on the job, earned nearly $1.4 million in 2021-22, according to Temple's most recent tax form.\n\nFry, Morgan said, is on board with Temple's pursuit of a merger with the recently shuttered University of the Arts. Morgan said he updated Fry on the talks Monday to make sure he was in support of proceeding.\n\nDrexel about two years ago had explored a possible merger with UArts, Fry said recently, but UArts only wanted a partial partnership, and Drexel didn't think that was significant enough.\n\nFor the first time, Fry will have to deal with faculty unions, which were non-existent at Drexel, Penn and F&M. In spring semester 2023, Temple experienced a six-week strike by its graduate student worker union. The Temple Association of University Professors, the faculty union, is amid negotiations with the administration.\n\n\"That will be a learning curve issue for me,\" Fry said. \"I look forward to getting to know the union leadership and understanding their perspective on things.\"\n\nFry did have dealings with other unions at Penn, and Drexel also has some unions.\n\nHe said he hopes that Temple faculty and the administration can come to an agreement soon.\n\n\"That would be the best thing for the university that doesn't need any additional distractions or anxiety,\" he said.\n\nFry has developed a reputation as an urban planner, as much as a college president. At Penn, he helped bring a movie theater and grocer to the neighborhood, create the public Penn Alexander School, and launch the University City District, fostering relationships among colleges, retailers, and residents.\n\nAnd at Drexel, he partnered with Brandywine Realty Trust to launch a multibillion-dollar project to turn parking lots and industrial buildings between Drexel's campus and 30th Street Station into a neighborhood of businesses, retailers, parks, and residential towers, called Schuylkill Yards. He launched a center for neighborhood partnerships and a school of entrepreneurship.\n\nHe acknowledged that any development around Temple would have to be carefully connected to the neighborhoods and not displace residents. Affordable housing would have to be part of the plan, he said.\n\nFry also cited Temple University Health System's important role in addressing health equity issues, but also the challenge the system has faced, given that 86% of its patients are covered by government health programs, both Medicaid and Medicare.\n\nGiving Fry a leg up, he already has a long relationship with Mike Young, CEO of Temple's health system, whom he called \"incredibly gifted.\" They worked together when Young led Lancaster General Hospital and Fry was at F&M.\n\nAs for Drexel, Fry said he plans to continue to oversee initiatives already under way, including the merger with Salus University, which was approved by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education this week and a gradual move from a quarter system to semesters.\n\n\"That's the best way for me to end my time at Drexel, with my foot still on the accelerator as it's been and not easing off on anything,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susan_snyder@inquirer.com", "name": "Susan Snyder", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "North Philadelphia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexel_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drexel University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temple University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Philadelphia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_Street_(Philadelphia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broad Street (Philadelphia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_&_Marshall_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin & Marshall College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lancaster, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Research university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_Arts_(Philadelphia)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of the Arts (Philadelphia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_System_of_Higher_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth System of Higher Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilt_Chamberlain", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wilt Chamberlain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philadelphia_Inquirer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoAnne_A._Epps", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JoAnne A.

Temple's board of directors unanimously voted to confirm his appointment Wednesday morning.\n\nFry said he was \"deeply humbled\" by the opportunity.\n\n\"Temple stands as a cornerstone of our region's vitality -- a vibrant and accessible anchor institution that provides transformative opportunities and positively impacts countless lives through its mission,\" Fry said in a statement.\n\nWithin the last year, Fry oversaw Drexel's merger with Salus University and the university's disbandment of a pro-Palestinian encampment on campus. His biggest achievements include partnering with Brandywine Realty Trust to transform a section of University City into Schuylkill Yards, a hub for technology and life sciences companies. He upgraded Drexel's campus, hammered out the university's affiliation with the Academy of Natural Sciences and oversaw Drexel and Tower Health's joint purchase of St. Christopher's Hospital for Children.\n\nTemple touted Fry's fundraising efforts as a hallmark of his Drexel tenure, citing the $800 million that a fundraising campaign generated from 42,000 alumni and 4,000 other donors between 2017 and 2022.\n\nAt Temple, Fry will be tasked with ensuring student safety - an issue that partly led to the resignation of former President Jason Wingard last year.\n\nIn February 2023, Temple police officer Christopher Fitzgerald was shot and killed while attempting to thwart a carjacking, intensifying concerns about violent crime near campus. A 21-year-old student had been fatlly shot several blocks from campus in November 2021, and there also had been several home invasions and carjackings involving students. Earlier this year, a Temple employee was stabbed near campus, and, in June, police charged a 21-year-old Temple student with murder for killing his girlfriend.\n\nFry told the Inquirer that safety would be an \"early priority\" in his tenure as Temple's president.\n\nWingard had became Temple's first Black president in 2021, but he stepped down less than two years later. He was set to face a no-confidence vote amid concerns about violent crime, labor disputes, financial challenges and falling enrollment.\n\nEpps took over on an interim basis until her death, and was posthumously named Temple's 14th president.\n\nBefore leading Drexel, Fry was executive vice president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2002 and the president of Franklin & Marshall College from 2002 to 2010.", "source": {"uri": "phillyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PhillyVoice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fry_(record_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Fry (record producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexel_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drexel University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temple University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salus_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Salus University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schuylkill_Yards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Schuylkill Yards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandywine_Realty_Trust", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandywine Realty Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Christopher's_Hospital_for_Children", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Christopher's Hospital for Children"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Wingard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Wingard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_&_Marshall_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franklin & Marshall College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violent crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Hinduism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Hinduism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/070324_John_Fry_Temple_Preside.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704022", "eventUri": "eng-9704022", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Fry was the top candidate to be Temple University's next president, board chair Mitchell L. Morgan heard from 150 people.\n\nWhen Fry was officially made president through a unanimous vote Wednesday morning, the reaction kept coming.\n\n\" READ MORE: As Drexel's John Fry gets voted in as Temple's next president, here's what he plans to do\n\nHere's what some local leaders are saying about his appointment:\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro: \"I've admired John Fry's exceptional leadership at Drexel University over the past 14 years -- and I have appreciated his advice and guidance during that time. He's a wise leader, a strong communicator, and a good man -- and his blend of academic and civic leadership puts him in a unique position to lead Temple University. I'm pleased to see his next step will keep him in Philadelphia as he leads Temple University into its next chapter -- a chapter I firmly believe holds great opportunity for the Temple community, the city of Philadelphia, and our Commonwealth.\"\n\nTemple Association of University Professors, the faculty union: \"Welcome to Temple University!\" the executive leadership of the 2,300-member union said in a letter to Fry. \"After years of instability, we are excited that the presidential search process is over and that you will be joining the Temple community.\"\n\nThe union told Fry about its membership, its current contract negotiations and the challenges its members face, citing concerns about \"a lack of job security, widespread gendered and racialized salary inequity, issues within the research office, and significant attrition.\" TAUP invited Fry to a meeting as soon as possible.\n\n\"We hope you will champion our principles of equity, dignity, and job security while taking active steps to build a constructive, collaborative relationship with the real Temple community: the organized labor, faculty, staff, and students that make us a world-class university,\" the union wrote.\n\nAmy Goldberg, dean of Temple's medical school and a member of the selection committee: \"Boy, I think we really hit it out of the park.\"\n\nFry, she said, is an experienced leader who believes in Temple's mission and its commitment to teaching, research and service to the community. He has shown he can make tough decisions, has emotional intelligence and a vision with a strategy to get the university there, she said.\n\n\"Of the many things that are so impressive about John is the relationships he has with so many different groups of people, whether that's the students and the faculty or the researchers or the community or industry. He really knows how to communicate and engage all of those different constituents.\"\n\nRichard Greenawalt, chair of Drexel University's board of trustees: \"We have been fortunate to have John serve as our president since 2010. Over his tenure, he implemented a dynamic vision for how an urban university can attract and inspire excellent students, conduct pathbreaking research and serve our communities.\"\n\nIn a message to the campus community, Greenawalt said the university would form a search committee to look for a new president in the coming weeks.\n\n\"Uncertainty and concern accompany any transition,\" he said. \"Rest assured, we have prepared a plan that prioritizes stability and continuity during this period.\"\n\nPa. state Sen. Vincent Hughes, whose district includes Drexel: \"John Fry is one of the nation's brightest spots in higher education. He is one of the country's best, most talented and most accomplished presidents of any university. I think coming out of the heartbreak of the loss of the previous president, this is a great selection... We've partnered throughout his entire tenure there.\"\n\nHughes said Fry is very \"knowledgeable about the needs of the community.\"\n\nPhiladelphia City Council President Kenyatta Johnson: Johnson called Fry \"an excellent choice.\"\n\n\"As a graduate student attending Penn in the early 2000s, I had the privilege of witnessing his exceptional leadership firsthand marked by transformational changes that benefited the university as well as the surrounding communities. John has the ability to forge strong partnerships and create positive change that will positively [impact] Temple's students, faculty, and the North Philadelphia community. I look forward to seeing his remarkable advancements that will propel Temple University to new heights.\"\n\nTemple University Graduate Students' Association, the union for graduate student workers:\n\n\"While we remain hopeful that President Fry will be an attentive and competent leader, the process by which he was appointed is a disappointing indication that the Board of Trustees, under the leadership of Chair Mitchell Morgan, remains committed to the exact business-as-usual approach that has led to our current leadership crisis and the continued degradation of Temple's educational integrity.\"\n\nUnions were not included in the search and selection, they said in a statement, and they were also critical of Fry's background, stating he has not been a dean or provost or conducted research, or worked for a public university or dealt with faculty unions. (Fry has a bachelor's from Lafayette College and an MBA from New York University's Stern School of Business and has noted that he has dealt with other types of unions, both at Drexel and at the University of Pennsylvania where he was an executive vice president for seven years. He also served as president of Franklin & Marshall College for eight years.)\n\n\"We wish President Fry well in his efforts,\" the graduate student union wrote. \"This is, of course, assuming that we share the same idea of what Temple's mission ultimately is. We can only hope that he approaches this position with a different perspective and set of values than former President [Jason] Wingard.\"\n\nShohreh Amini, professor of biology and president of Temple's faculty senate, who served on the search committee: She said she liked that Fry was interested in every aspect of the job and knows Philadelphia well.\n\n\"He can get up and running the first day,\" she said.\n\nShe said she was not bothered by Fry's not having a doctoral degree, noting his MBA.\n\n\"His experience way overcomes the lack of a degree,\" she said.\n\nQuaiser Abdullah, assistant professor of instruction in the College of Media and Communication, who served on the search committee: \"Our faculty have not always felt heard when it comes to university developments. During this search, faculty voices were heard and respected... I am confident that Temple has chosen someone who will help us build on this university's standing as a global center of academic excellence.\"\n\nTemple Student Government: \"After an extensive search, Temple Student Government is thrilled to welcome Fry into this crucial leadership role. During his 14 years as Drexel's President, Fry demonstrated a fervent commitment to fostering a flourishing educational environment and was always available to listen to the concerns of both students and longtime residents near campus.\n\n\"At Drexel, Fry's numerous accomplishments included helping to revitalize local neighborhoods in West Philadelphia, expanding the school's international presence, and successful fundraising. His record makes clear that when Fry commits to a leadership role, he is all in.\"", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

I love Drexel. I just started my 15th year on Monday and there's a time where you feel like you've given everything you have to give. The average tenure I think for a University president now is five and a half years. I think I've been able to do much better than that and do so with so much commitment and energy. I really do love the place. I've never had a bad day at Drexel. But, personally, I'm 64 years old. I would like to be able to have one more institution that I impact and if I'm going to do that, the time is probably now. It's for very personal reasons.\n\nI can tell you this was really not an easy decision. I spent the last three days, I probably talked to over 250 people from Drexel, just thanking them for their incredible work and their support and their friendship and it was really hard to do. The way I think about this is Drexel has been so compelling to me and now I look at another compelling institution like Temple. I feel like I have one more opportunity to do something meaningful, running a university that is also in my hometown, and that has a lot to do with it. We all love Philly. I raised my kids here. We're so happy here. The opportunity to be involved with yet another Philadelphia institution -- and beyond Drexel I used to work at Penn -- just feels like a great next step for me.\n\nSM: What are your goals for Temple during your presidency?\n\nJF: I'd say there's short-term, the things that I would want to do right away, and there are long term things. The first short-term goal is to really get to know the Temple University and Temple Health community and the neighbors in North Philadelphia. Just to really sort of understand at the university, in the health system and in the neighborhoods, what are people's priorities? What do they care about? What do they think Temple as a whole can do for them individually, but for the community collectively? I think always the best way to start one of these jobs is just to listen and get to know people and to absorb what the environment is all about.\n\nThe second thing would be to focus immediate attention on campus and neighborhood safety and Temple has commissioned a report from former Police Commissioner Ramsey, it's called 21CP. That's his company and they went through an extensive analysis of all the things that Temple could do to improve campus and neighborhood safety. They've implemented many of those things -- enhancing the police force and lighting, making sure there's good feedback and advisory groups in place from students.\n\nI'm familiar with this because we did this in the summer of 2020. We also hired Charles Ramsey at Drexel. He also provided a 21CP report. We've implemented those recommendations. We hired Chief Singleton to help lead us forward and I think we've had really good results. I think Temple was incredibly smart to do what they did and what I want to do is really sort of get to know not only the strategy, but the people, the officers, the security guards, the people who support campus safety administratively, especially the Vice President for Public Safety and really see what I can do to support their work.\n\nThe third would be to begin to work with the enrollment team to look at their plans for both stabilizing and enhancing enrollment and maybe to bring some of my experience in that regard to the table, not only the undergraduate freshmen recruitment, but also graduate recruitment, online, and their international strategy. Also domestically, how do you spread the word about Temple? Those would be some of the immediate things that I would do.\n\nLonger term, two things in particular. One is once I understand the institution better, making plans for investing in academic excellence, in student success, in employee development. How can we enhance this university in terms of what its people do and how do we give them the optimal amount of support to do so? Those kinds of investments. Also an emphasis on philanthropy. Temple in 10 years will be 150 years old. That's a perfect way of creating a context for saying, as we approach 150 years since the founding, what are the types of investments that Temple deserves from its alumni, its friends, its foundations, corporations and others who support it?\n\nSM: How do you think Drexel and its future are going to be affected by you leaving your position?\n\nJF: I think that if I pride myself on one thing it's that I've spent so much time building an amazing team so I'd really like to think and I think this is a fair statement that when I do go over to Temple -- and we haven't determined that date yet -- it will be sad for me and my colleagues who are also my friends, but mostly it'll be smooth. We have such capacity and depth in our administration. We also have an amazing board who I've worked so closely with and who my team works so closely with and between the depth and talent in the administration and the depth and the commitment of the board I feel like yes, they will miss me initially, but it is such an amazing institution. It will be so attractive to people who want to be its next president. I feel like all is going to go well. I'm already preparing my team for that transition.\n\nSM: Are there any new candidates in mind for who will fill your position that you can speak about?\n\nJF: No, it's so early. I'm honestly still digesting all this news and I think what's going to happen is our chair Rich Greenwalt is going to identify a search committee. I know he's working on that right now. He's also going to select a search firm and I know they're working on that right now. I suspect this effort will start up very soon so we can get a jump on the recruitment season. It's always good to get a jump because you tend to get the better candidates that way. I think this search is going to start quickly. I think it's going to move very expeditiously and there's gonna be a ton of people who are going to be interested in competing to be Drexel's next president. Obviously no one knows better than me what the benefits of that job are and so I'll of course be on hand if they need me to help in any way. I don't think there's going to be any shortage of great candidates. I am sure that the next president of Drexel is going to be an absolute star.\n\nSM: What do you feel is your biggest lasting impact on Drexel?\n\nJF: I think I'm proud maybe of two things. The first is that early on in my tenure at Drexel, almost from the start, I wanted to prioritize student success. I felt like we were recruiting classes, but I'm not sure how well we were supporting those classes from everything from financial aid, to advising, to counseling, to better spaces for them to live and all the other things that make for a well-rounded student experience. Also, really trying to make it easier for students to do the things that they wanted to do and to make it not burdensome administratively. I don't think we've succeeded on all those fronts completely, but I do think that the Drexel we have today versus before is much more focused on the success of students, and taking barriers out of their way and being much more generous with financial aid, and really trying to do everything we can to make the campus experience and also the co-op experience much better. I'm really proud. I'm proud of that, how we've leaned into that and I hope we've made some real progress.\n\nThe other thing I'm really proud of is the way we've really engaged in meaningful ways with our neighbors around so many issues that they really felt were lacking at Drexel in terms of the civic work that is now in place through the Dornscife Center, through the Lindy Center, through the new Powel Science Leadership Academy Middle School. All the things we've done to try to make our neighbors really feel part of our university and in doing so to create an environment for our students especially and our faculty, to also work with neighbors on really complicated challenges, particularly urban challenges. If you take a look at the level of engagement between Drexel students and faculty with our neighbors in Powelton Village and Mantua and West Powelton, it's been very very significant. It's something I'm really personally proud of because Anthony J. Drexel didn't set up Drexel to be a sort of institution like an ivory tower. He set it up in the middle of the city and wanted it to have extensive connections to surrounding neighborhoods and to the city of Philadelphia. I feel like in many ways we may have realized some of those aspirations during my time at Drexel and that work will carry on. It's strong. It's significant. It's meaningful, and I think it helps a lot of people.\n\nSM: Do you have any last parting words for the student body of Drexel?\n\nJF: You guys are so talented and so amazing and so humane in terms of the things that you do. I will really miss you dearly. It's always been the best part of my experience at Drexel just watching what our students do with the things that we've given them, but especially with the things that they've just started themselves and just sort of figured it out. They're just so resilient.\n\nThe other thing I would want to convey is, thank you for being so constructive. In all my office hours and all the things I've dealt with students over years, very rarely did I get a complaint without a recommendation. Drexel students are unfailingly constructive. They have criticisms. They think we can do things better and they're right. But, they always have a proposal along with the criticism and I can't tell you how much that means to me because I always feel like after a conversation like that, I walk away having a pretty good idea of what I need to, as opposed to just being criticized. That's important. That shows their level of maturity and I think as a result our university has gotten better because we've had so many students working constructively to help us do so.", "source": {"uri": "thetriangle.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Triangle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophia_mattia@thetriangle.org", "name": "Sophia Mattia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fry_(record_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Fry (record producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexel_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drexel University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Science", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Master of Science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Temple University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Philadelphia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undergraduate_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Undergraduate education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drexel_Dragons_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drexel Dragons men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Leadership_Academy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Science Leadership Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powelton_Village,_Philadelphia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Powelton Village, Philadelphia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Joseph_Drexel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Joseph Drexel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantua", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mantua"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mantua"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.thetriangle.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240701_Fry_J_-_004_edit_150-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704022", "eventUri": "eng-9704022", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-03", "textStart": 58, "textEnd": 64}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The Sports Illustrated star packed on the PDA with Prince Constantine Alexios of Greece and Denmark, 25, on Friday, as they strolled through New York together. It comes just a few months after DailyMail.com confirmed that Nader, 27, and her husband of nearly four years Billy Haire were divorcing. Prince Constantine is a native New Yorker who is the grandson of the late King Constantine II, and the eldest son and second child of Crown Prince Pavlos, 57, and Crown Princess Marie-Chantal, 55. His mother is the daughter of an American-born British businessman Robert Miller and Ecuadoran beauty Mar\u00eda Clara Pesantes Becerra. Although Greece's monarchy was abolished in 1973, the descendants of King Constantine II have maintained their titles and represent the nation. Prince Constantine's grandfather was the second cousin of King Charles III, and was Prince William's godfather. Interestingly, the Prince of Wales is Constantine's godfather. Constantine attended secondary school in England and graduated from Georgetown University in May 2022. According to The Australian Women's Weekly, Tino, as he is known to his friends, is reportedly pursuing a career as a sculptor. The Sports Illustrated swimsuit model beat the heat wearing a curve clinging white mini-dress with a ruffled hem. She showcased her lithe limbs in the sleeveless frock, stepping out in a pair of white sandals. The 27-year-old beauty's long dark hair was parted in the middle and styled straight. She wore natural looking makeup with a soft pink lip and accessorized with a couple of bangles on her wrist and gold earrings. The handsome young royal looked relaxed in a white striped button down shirt, distressed jeans and brown shoes. His blonde hair was brushed away from his face and he wore a square gold medallion around his neck while sweetly carrying his lady love's white leather purse. The couple are believed to be in the Big Apple head of the wedding of model Olivia Culpo to Christian McCaffrey, which is rumored to take place in the bride's native Rhode Island. It's unclear how long the relationship between the model and the prince has been going on. Daily Mail confirmed that Nader and husband Billy Haire were divorcing after four years of marriage. The decision to go their separate ways was amicable, according to a source. In the past he has been connected to model Poppy Delevingne, 38. The pair ended their romance in December, with an insider telling Daily Mail the age gap was the reason. 'They are just at different stages of their life. There is no animosity,' the source said.", "summary": "Brooks Nader\u00a0appears to have a new Royal love in her life!", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13581655/Brooks-Nader-Prince-Constantine-Alexios-Greece-appear-dating-pack-PDA-NYC-just-months-split-Billy-Haire.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/28/23/86715369-0-image-m-95_1719613484054.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:32:24", "author": "Alesia Stanford,Editor", "authors": ["Alesia Stanford", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.553}

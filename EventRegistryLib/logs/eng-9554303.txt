Long enlisted in January 1969 and deployed later that year.\n\nThe family member said Long returned to Minnesota in February 1972 and was discharged from the Army a month later. Long was last seen or heard from in October 1972 when he told his family that he was leaving Minnesota for the West Coast.\n\nWith this new information, the FBI Laboratory's Latent Print Unit was able to compare partial fingerprints collected from the remains in 1975 to known fingerprint records belonging to Long.

A Munsingwear brand jacket was also found alongside the remains, prompting detectives to nickname the deceased \"Munsingwear Doe.\"\n\nSince the discovery, detectives and cold case volunteers have tried to identify \"Munsingwear Doe\" with little success, and it ultimately took nearly five decades before a breakthrough was possible.\n\nIn August 2023 the CCSO and the Intermountain Forensics of Salt Lake City used the Forensic Genetic Genealogy process -- a process that emerged in 2018 -- in which the DNA of a deceased person is matched to others on genealogy databases. Through this process, they were able to \"identify a family line\" and by February, identified Long as a \"potential match.\"\n\nFrom there, detectives contacted a family member from the line, who shared Long's history. They noted that he was a \"US Army veteran\" who enlisted in January 1969 and deployed out to Vietnam that year.\n\nFurther interviews with family members revealed that Long returned home to Minnesota in February 1972 and was discharged from the military a month later. He then told family members that he \"was leaving Minnesota and heading to the West Coast,\" and had never been heard from again.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\nThe CCSO said the FBI Laboratory's Latent Print Unit took the partial fingerprints from the skeletal remains and were able to positively match it with fingerprint records taken from the former veteran. To further ensure that the remains belonged to Long, detectives took a DNA sample from the family and through \"DNA comparison,\" were able to confirm the skeleton's identity once again.\n\nWhile detectives were able to determine the identity of the skeletal remains, they also noted that they were unable to determine Long's cause of death.\n\nThe CCSO noted that in light of the positive identification, Long's family has \"requested privacy.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scientific method"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flagstaff, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Flagstaff, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconino_County,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coconino County, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coconino County, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_genealogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic genealogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cold case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genealogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forensic science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Database"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Coast of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skeleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Science_in_Society/Forensic_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Science in Society/Forensic Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/LyBmN66uV9bHQacwJC8XfYlt56c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x393:736x395)/skeletal-remains-found-az-050924-4c9dfd8671d644399a6c0eba84700032.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554303", "eventUri": "eng-9554303", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 222, "textEnd": 227}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 555, "textEnd": 563}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

A news release says the only identified remains became known as Munsingwear Doe because a Munsingwear brand jacket was found with the body.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office says a genetic genealogy DNA profile developed by Intermountain Forensics was compared with existing profiles available in genealogy databases and was matched with a relative of Gerald Long. The tentative identification was eventually verified by the FBI Latent Print Unit and the DNA profile was directly compared to a DNA sample from a member of Long's family earlier this month.\n\nA surviving family member told Arizona detectives that Long enlisted in the Army in 1969 and was deployed to Vietnam later that year.

A Munsingwear brand jacket was also found alongside the remains, prompting detectives to nickname the deceased \"Munsingwear Doe.\"\n\nRelated: Human Remains Discovered in 1978 Identified as Teen Who Disappeared on Her Birthday: 'We Found My Sister'\n\nSince the discovery, detectives and cold case volunteers have tried to identify \"Munsingwear Doe\" with little success, and it ultimately took nearly five decades before a breakthrough was possible.\n\nIn August 2023 the CCSO and the Intermountain Forensics of Salt Lake City used the Forensic Genetic Genealogy process -- a process that emerged in 2018 -- in which the DNA of a deceased person is matched to others on genealogy databases. Through this process, they were able to \"identify a family line\" and by February, identified Long as a \"potential match.\"\n\nRelated: Skeletal Remains Found in Remote Utah Mountain Range Identified as Man Missing Since 2019\n\nFrom there, detectives contacted a family member from the line, who shared Long's history. They noted that he was a \"US Army veteran\" who enlisted in January 1969 and deployed out to Vietnam that year.\n\nFurther interviews with family members revealed that Long returned home to Minnesota in February 1972 and was discharged from the military a month later. He then told family members that he \"was leaving Minnesota and heading to the West Coast,\" and had never been heard from again.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\nThe CCSO said the FBI Laboratory's Latent Print Unit took the partial fingerprints from the skeletal remains and were able to positively match it with fingerprint records taken from the former veteran. To further ensure that the remains belonged to Long, detectives took a DNA sample from the family and through \"DNA comparison,\" were able to confirm the skeleton's identity once again.\n\nWhile detectives were able to determine the identity of the skeletal remains, they also noted that they were unable to determine Long's cause of death.\n\nThe CCSO noted that in light of the positive identification, Long's family has \"requested privacy.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

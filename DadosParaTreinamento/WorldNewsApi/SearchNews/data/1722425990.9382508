{"id": 243258456, "title": "Father of Prince William and Kate's pal Rose Cholmondeley compares his stay at 'paradise' country...", "text": "What could be more enchanting than staying at Slebech Park, Pembrokeshire, whose Grade II coach house hotel was described by a visitor last month as 'a piece of paradise'? Well, really rather a lot, says Tim Hanbury, a chum of the Duke of Beaufort since their days at Eton. 'I wouldn't 100 per cent recommend Slepeck [sic] Park country house hotel for a romantic stay,' Hanbury announces on social media, treating friends to a series of snaps of Slebech which are in dismal contrast to the drone footage on the hotel's website. His wife, Emma, to whom Hanbury gives the playful alias 'Wemdog', likened her stay, he adds, to 'being in a gaol'. The hotel, which has received both praise and brickbats, declines to comment. But it can perhaps console itself that the Hanburys are not like other guests. Their elder daughter, Marina, is the third wife of Ned Lambton, Earl of Durham, owner of Lambton Castle and Biddick Hall in County Durham and the dazzling Villa Cetinale in Tuscany. Their younger daughter, former model Rose Hanbury, a friend of the Prince and Princess of Wales, is married to the Marquess of Cholmondeley, who makes do with the splendid Houghton Hall in Norfolk and Cholmondeley Castle in Cheshire.", "summary": "Hanbury announces on social media, treating friends to a series of snaps of Slebech which are in dismal contrast to the drone footage on the hotel's website.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13581895/Prince-William-Kate-Rose-Cholmondeley.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/28/23/86717599-0-image-m-11_1719615033596.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:17:24", "author": "Editor,Richard Eden", "authors": ["Editor", "Richard Eden"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.793}

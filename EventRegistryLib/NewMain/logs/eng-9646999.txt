Last month, he and his wife welcomed their first child into the world. Then eleven days later, Scheffler was arrested at the PGA Championship after an incident with a police officer (the charges were later dropped). Now he must face another daunting task: winning his third career major championship at the U.S. Open on Course No. 2 at the Pinehurst Resort in North Carolina.\n\nAnd for you, a task less daunting. You need to learn how to watch the U.S. Open Golf Championship and find out if Scheffler will do what all of his fans are expecting him to: win.\n\nScheffler has never won a U.S. Open before, but he enters this year's contest as the hands-down favorite. It's easy to see why. He's won more titles prior to the Open than any other player in decades. Oddsmakers give him a 4-1 chance of taking the prize, with Rory McIlroy the next highest favorite at 9-1 odds. In other words, the major is Scheffler's to lose. But anything can happen when you're out on the fairway. Indeed, you might even get arrested on your way to the fairway.\n\nWhether or not Scheffler captures the third major of his career will be the dominant story going into the Open, which starts on Thursday, June 13 and ends Sunday, June 16. If Scheffler can pull it off, he'll become only the second player (after Tiger Woods) to win the U.S. Open while ranked world number one.\n\nFrom the first drive to the final putt, here's how to catch all the U.S. Open action and witness (perhaps) Scottie Scheffler continue his journey into golf immortality.\n\nHint: if you don't have cable, you'll need access to USA, NBC, and the Golf Channel.\n\nThe USA Network will be providing lots of U.S. Open coverage throughout the four-day event. On Thursday, June 13, full Round 1 coverage will air from 6:30 a.m. ET until 5 p.m. ET. On Saturday, June 15, you can catch Round 3 action on USA from 10 a.m. ET until noon. Finally, on Sunday, you can watch Round 4 coverage from 9 a.m. ET until 12 p.m. ET.\n\nNBC will host primetime coverage of the U.S. Open from Friday, June 14 until Sunday, June 16. On Friday, tune in to NBC from 1 p.m. ET to 7 p.m. ET for Round 2 play. On Saturday, Round 3 will be on NBC nearly all day, from noon until 8 p.m. ET. On Sunday, the final round of U.S. Open action will be on NBC from noon until 7 p.m. ET.\n\nFinally, The Golf Channel will host its Golf Central: Live from the U.S. Open program every day of the tournament. On Thursday, June 13, coverage will run from 8 p.m. ET until 10 p.m. ET. On Friday, June 14, the program will air from 7 p.m. ET until 9 p.m. ET. On Saturday, the program will air at two different times: in the morning, from 8 a.m. ET until 10 a.m. ET, and again in the evening from 8 p.m. ET to 10 p.m. ET. And lastly, on Sunday you can catch Golf Central: Live from the U.S. Open on the Golf Channel from 8 a.m. ET until 10 a.m. ET, and then again from 7 p.m. ET to 9 p.m. ET.\n\nRound 1 and Round 2 coverage of the U.S. Open will be live on Peacock on Thursday, June 13 and Friday, June 14. On Thursday, Peacock will take over the broadcast from the USA Network at 5 p.m. ET and conclude at 8 p.m. ET. On Friday, Peacock will host early coverage of Round 2 from 6:30 a.m. ET until 1 p.m. ET. At that point, the broadcast will shift to NBC. But once primetime coverage wraps on NBC at 7 p.m. ET, Peacock will resume Round 2 action until 8 p.m. ET.\n\nIf you're looking to watch the 2024 U.S. Open, Fubo is a great choice. Enjoy all the coverage of the tournament with a seven-day free trial. After that, continue with Fubo for as little as $79.99 per month. With access to nearly 200 channels, including the USA Network, NBC, and the Golf Channel, you won't miss any of the action.

For an impressive range of content, opt for the Ultimate + Sports Pack at $109.99 per month for the first month, featuring 160+ channels and a $44.99 savings.\n\nFor comprehensive coverage of the U.S. Open, consider Hulu + Live TV at $77/month.

These VPNs hide your location, allowing you to access US streaming platforms such as NBC and the USA Network.

The USGA has loaded up its premier event with nearly all the best golfers in the world as 2024 U.S. Open contenders prepare this week to take on Pinehurst No. 2 for the first time in a decade.\n\nScottie Scheffler enters yet another major as the favorite, this time coming off a newsworthy effort at the PGA Championship marred by an arrest for which all charges have been dropped. Scheffler, who has already won the Masters and Players Championship this season, may well have taken the PGA if not for those unfortunate events. Instead, he enters Pinehurst, North Carolina, looking to get back into the winner's circle.\n\nRory McIlroy is again seeking a return to major glory. Xander Schauffele, having conquered the PGA to claim his first major (and first PGA Tour victory in nearly two years), will look to make it consecutive Americans winning the national title. That's after reigning champion Wyndham Clark conquered Los Angeles Country Club a year ago. Clark had made some moves this season but missed the cut at both the Masters and PGA; still, he has four top-three finishes on the year, including a victory at the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am. Jon Rahm was another potential contender, but he withdrew from the U.S. Open on Tuesday while dealing with a nagging foot injury.\n\nElsewhere, Tiger Woods enters the U.S. Open on a sponsor's exemption having not been healthy enough to play the tournament since 2020. He has not finished inside the top 25 at a major since the 2019 U.S. Open, failing to play through the weekend across four of the last five majors in which he has played. And then there's Phil Mickelson, who has missed three of the last four U.S. Open cuts and not finished inside the top 30 at this event since 2014. Lefty still hopes to complete the career grand slam with those six second-place finishes at the U.S. Open continuing to haunt him.\n\nWhile attending the U.S. Open can be a ton of fun, simply being able to watch golf on the game's grandest stage is an incredible treat each year. We here at CBS Sports are thrilled to bring you wall-to-wall coverage of the U.S. Open all week long.\n\nEnough talking about it.

Learn more\n\nThe US Open returns for its 124th year on Thursday morning, with the competition scheduled to run through the weekend. Coverage is a bit complicated, but we've combed through all of the details so that you don't have to. Keep reading to learn how to watch the US Open from home.\n\nRather than take place on the same course each year, the US Open rotates through a handful of golf courses around the country. This year's tournament will take place at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina. Scottie Scheffler, the 2024 Masters Tournament champion and the current world no. 1 player in the PGA, is a favorite to win at the US Open this year. Scheffler will tee off for Round 1 on Thursday at 1:14 p.m. ET, alongside no. 2 Xander Schauffele and no. 3 Rory McIlroy. Tiger Woods, Max Home, and 2023 US Open Champion Wyndham Clark are also scheduled to tee off on Thursday.\n\nWhether you're rooting for Scheffler to win his first US Open or hoping to see Clark pull off another victory, you're in luck. Below, we've outlined the services that will allow you to live stream the tournament and detailed the options you need each day.\n\nUS Open coverage is spread across NBC, USA, and Peacock in the US. Round 1 coverage begins on Thursday, when USA will carry the tournament from 6:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET. Peacock will then carry coverage from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. ET. Friday's Round 2 coverage starts on Peacock from 6:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. ET, before it switches to NBC from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m. ET. On Thursday and Friday, you can keep up with all of the action just on Peacock if you're looking to simplify your streaming plans. Peacock subscriptions start at just $5.99 a month.\n\nYou'll need to branch out beyond Peacock for weekend coverage since the streaming service's US Open All Access is slightly more limited on Saturday and Sunday. The live TV packages we outline below will have you covered for the weekend, in addition to a Peacock subscription. To access NBC and USA, you'll need to subscribe to a live TV streaming package like Sling TV or Fubo. When it comes to both of these options, you should double-check that NBC is available in your area by inputting your zip code before signing up.\n\nTo get USA and NBC on Sling TV, you'll need to opt for the service's Sling Blue plan, which costs $40 a month. New users can get half-off their first month, so it's only a $20 investment up-front. Fubo is another solid option that carries both NBC and USA. The service costs $79.99 a month, but new users are eligible for a one-week free trial.\n\nUS Open coverage airs on Sky Sports in the UK. You can stream all the action through Now TV, where subscription prices and contracts vary. Now offers a single-day pass for \u00a314.99, which is a solid option if you only want to tune in for a specific round.\n\nYou don't need to worry about missing out on the action if you'll be traveling away from home during the tournament. You can easily keep up with your streaming subscriptions via VPN. Short for virtual private networks, VPNs allow you to temporarily change your device's location so that you can keep up with your usual websites and apps from anywhere. Since the services we've highlighted require country-specific forms of payment, this suggestion is best for people who are just hoping to keep up with their existing subscriptions while traveling abroad.\n\nExpressVPN is our go-to recommendation, since it's easy to use and has a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can read all about it in our ExpressVPN review.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lillian_brown@businessinsider.com", "name": "Lillian Brown", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sling TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_statistical_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Combined statistical area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now_(Sky)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Now (Sky)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual private network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66688a4ce07904901817c3df?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646999", "eventUri": "eng-9646999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

The tournament will be played at Pinehurst No. 2 in Pinehurst, North Carolina.\n\nThe U.S. Open Golf Championship will air on USA Network, NBC and Peacock.\n\nWhile many cable packages include NBC and USA Network, it's easy to watch the 2024 U.S. Open Golf Championship on TV if those channels aren't included in your cable TV subscription, or if you don't have cable at all. Your best options for watching are below. (Streaming options will require an internet provider.) To watch all the coverage, you'll need a subscription to Peacock and a subscription to one of the platforms featured below.\n\nIn addition to major golf events like the U.S. Open Golf Championship, Peacock offers its subscribers live streaming access to NFL games that air on NBC. The streaming service has plenty more live sports to offer, including Big Ten basketball, Premier League soccer and WWE wrestling (including formerly PPV-only events such as Wrestlemania). There's 80,000 hours worth of recorded content to watch as well, including hit movies and TV series such as \"The Office\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\"\n\nPeacock costs $6 per month. An annual subscription to Peacock is currently $60.\n\nTop features of Peacock:\n\nYou can also catch the U.S. Open Golf Championship on Fubo. Fubo is a sports-centric streaming service that offers access network-aired sports like this weekend' golf tournament and almost every NFL game next season.

The streamer also offers access to the NFL Network, local NBC, Fox and ABC affiliates (where available), USA Network and ESPN with its Orange + Blue Tier plan. Also worth noting: Sling TV comes with 50 hours of cloud-based DVR recording space included, perfect for recording all the season's top NFL matchups.\n\nThat plan normally costs $60 per month, but the streamer is currently offering $30 off when you prepay for three months of service.\n\nTop features of Sling TV Orange + Blue tier:\n\nYou can watch the 2024 U.S. Open Golf Championship and many other top-tier sports, including the NFL Network, with Hulu + Live TV.

Here's the kicker: There's no monthly charge.\n\nAnyone living in partially blocked-off area (those near mountains or first-floor apartments), a digital TV antenna may not pick up a good signal -- or any signal at all. But for many homes, a digital TV antenna provides a seriously inexpensive way to watch golf live without paying a cable company. Indoor TV antennas can also provide some much-needed TV backup if a storm knocks out your cable.\n\nThis ultra-thin, multi-directional digital antenna with a 65-mile range can receive hundreds of HD TV channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Fox, Univision and can filter out cellular and FM signals. It delivers a high-quality picture in 1080p HDTV, top-tier sound and features a 12-foot digital coax cable.\n\nBelow, find each network's coverage of the 2024 U.S. Open Golf Championship.", "source":

After the free trial, the Choice package costs $79.99 a month.\n\nStream the US Open on fubo\n\nfubo is very similar to DirecTV Stream, bringing live TV channels without a cable box or satellite.

The superstars have all become part of one media company's strategy to boost its streaming service, as the landscape continuously shifts toward more live broadcasts off cable and network TV.\n\nNBCUniversal, via Peacock, has leaned in to that online paywall strategy like so many others. In the last 12 months, the streamer has used premium-game inventory -- like the NFL playoffs and Clark's biggest moment with Iowa -- to try to drive new subscribers. Now, golf can be added to that list.\n\nDuring the first two rounds of the U.S. Open, Peacock has 11.5 hours of exclusive coverage, or 42.5% of the total 27 hours that NBC Sports plans to be on air showing the championship's early happenings. That's up slightly from just under nine Peacock-only hours on Thursday and Friday last year.\n\nThe kicker this year is who is playing during Peacock's coverage. The three top-ranked players in the world -- Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, and Rory McIlroy -- are grouped together in the U.S. Open's marquee threesome. Their first round (1:14 p.m. ET tee time) concluded on Peacock, and nearly all of their second round (7:29 a.m.) will play out on the streamer.\n\nNBC Sports released its coverage plans last week, before tee times were announced Tuesday, but it's certainly possible that network power brokers made it known who they would prefer to play when. While Scheffler's group is Peacock-heavy, it should be noted that the entirety of Tiger Woods's first two rounds were available on USA or NBC.\n\nStreaming is bountiful throughout men's golf major championships these days, not just at the U.S. Open. The first two rounds of the PGA Championship in May had 10 exclusive hours on ESPN+. The Masters didn't come on ESPN until 3 p.m. ET, although streaming options earlier in the day were free through the tournament's website and app, in addition to paid offerings from ESPN+.\n\nNBC Sports has not released its full coverage plan for the final men's major of the year, the Open Championship, but last year Peacock did have some exclusive windows.\n\nIn January, Peacock's exclusive NFL stream of the Chiefs-Dolphins playoff game led to both subscriber and subsequent revenue growth. When Clark broke the NCAA women's basketball scoring record in February, it was also Peacock that had the broadcast.\n\nIn September, Peacock will carry the NFL's first game from Brazil on the Friday night of Week 1, as well as another exclusive Notre Dame football broadcast, as it has done in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_rumsey@frontofficesports.com", "name": "David Rumsey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peacock_(streaming_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peacock (streaming service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBCUniversal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre_Dame_Fighting_Irish_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Broadcasting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/USATSI_22819263_168392832_lowres-e1718300097688.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9646999", "eventUri": "eng-9646999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

The closest major city is Fayetteville, N.C., but the resort is also within an hour and a half's drive from Raleigh and Greensboro while it's just over two hours to Charlotte.\n\nThis week, the best in the world will play the resort's No. 2 golf course, which was the second course laid out on the site.\n\nThe village itself is a hotbed for golf. In addition to the resort's 10 18-hole golf courses and Cradle par-3 course, the region also boasts Tobacco Road, Mid Pines, Southern Pines, Pine Needles and Country Club of North Carolina which, are all within GOLF's top 20 courses in North Carolina.\n\nThe No. 2 course isn't even the only GOLF Top 100 U.S. course at the resort. In addition to the 1907 Donald Ross layout the USGA will use for this week's U.S. Open, the No. 4 course also features in GOLF's Top 100 U.S. rankings after an extensive 2018 redesign by Gil Hanse.\n\nUSA and NBC will air the 2024 U.S. Open on TV. USA will carry the first round on Thursday, as well as early coverage on the weekend. NBC will carry the second, third and final rounds on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.\n\nPeacock will be the primary streaming home for the 2024 U.S. Open.

Only the Greens understand that the solutions to the climate crisis are also the solutions to the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\"The climate crisis is the most serious we face as a global community. Our commitment to you is that protecting our climate and nature lies at the heart of all of our policies.\"\n\nMr Ramsay added: \"We would stop all new fossil fuel projects in the UK and cancel those that have been recently licensed like Rosebank.\n\n\"We would be more ambitious than any other party when it comes to renewable energy, investing to ensure that our energy can come from wind and solar power. A secure energy supply and action on the climate crisis go hand in hand.\n\n\"Our investments in public transport, supporting the switch to electric vehicles and homes heated without fossil fuels means we would put this country on the path to being net zero years ahead of other parties.\"\n\nElsewhere, the party proposed a frequent-flyer levy, a rise in the minimum wage to \u00a315 and renewed its pledge to abolish tuition fees.\n\nWe want to be welcoming, promote social cohesion and support migrants to put down roots\n\nThe manifesto also vows to disband the \"dysfunctional\" Home Office and replace it with a new \"Department of Migration\" - separate from the criminal justice system - as part of commitments for fair treatment towards migrants and valuing the \"contributions\" they make to British society.\n\n\"We want to be welcoming, promote social cohesion and support migrants to put down roots,\" the document said.\n\nOn the party's plans to abolish immigration detention centres, Mr Ramsay said: \"We're talking about giving people accommodation in society, rather than being in a detention centre.\"\n\nOn defence, the party would maintain spending at 2% of GDP, but Mr Ramsay argued that nuclear weapons are an \"outdated system\".\n\n\"We need to make sure that the money we're putting into defence is used effectively on personnel, on the great work that our Army does for humanitarian work around the world and which we can continue to step up,\" he said.\n\nA Green Economic Transition plan is also included in the manifesto, which would aim to upgrade homes across the UK to increase their energy efficiency.\n\nOpening the manifesto launch, Brighton Pavilion candidate Sian Berry said that as a renter herself, ending the housing crisis is a \"top priority\" for the party.\n\nThe party has promised to provide 150,000 new social homes every year and a \"fair deal for renters\" by giving powers to local authorities to introduce rent control measures.\n\nIt is unlikely that the specific tax-raising measures they propose to help achieve all this would raise the sorts of sums they claim - and certainly not without real economic cost\n\nAsked whether the party would consider building on the green belt to achieve its housing target, Ms Denyer said the 150,000 social homes a year by the end of the parliament would come from a \"mixture of building and buying from the private sector\".\n\nThe IFS said the party's proposal to restrict income tax relief on pension contributions would hit nurses and teachers, although its deputy director Helen Miller described some of the plans, such as closing loopholes within inheritance tax, as \"sensible\".\n\nMs Miller said: \"While some of the measures are targeted at the wealthy, the effects of the package would be much broader.\n\n\"Most obviously, it would be impossible to raise over \u00a390 billion from taxing carbon emissions without the effect being felt by everyone.\"\n\nShe added: \"It is unlikely that the specific tax-raising measures they propose to help achieve all this would raise the sorts of sums they claim - and certainly not without real economic cost.\"\n\nMr Ramsay said the party is \"realistic\" that it does \"not expect to form the next government\".\n\nHe said: \"When the Conservatives are booted out of Number 10 on July 4 and Labour take over, we plan to be there in Parliament in greater numbers to speak up for you on the issues that you care about.\"\n\nMr Ramsay added: \"Because with more Green MPs in Parliament, we will push Labour to stop backtracking on their promises.\"\n\nMs Berry confirmed that four party candidates had been de-selected because of antisemitism allegations.", "source": {"uri": "kentonline.co.uk",

The economy is not working for them.\n\n\"They have been priced out of the housing market and are struggling to fund their education.\"\n\nEnergy\n\nThe Green Party said it will \"accelerate clean energy investment and delivery\" by cancelling recent oil and gas licences such as those for the Rosebank oil and gas field, removing all oil and gas subsidies and stopping all new fossil fuel extraction projects in the UK.\n\nThe party also said it wants to see \"the phase-out of all nuclear energy\" and will push for wind power to provide 70 per cent of UK energy by 2030.\n\nMs Denyer said the Greens would invest \u00a330bn in insulating homes over the next five years. \"Warm, secure, affordable homes are something that millions of people in this country don't have,\" she added.\n\nEnvironment\n\nOn nature and the environment, the party has outlined extensive plans to protect and restore the UK's environment by \"giving rights to nature itself\".\n\nThe party will work to end the sewage scandal, extend people's access to nature with a new English Right to Roam Act, and end the emergency authorisation of bee-killing pesticides.\n\nOn protecting animals and habitats, elected MPs will call for an end to all blood sports, badger culling, factory farming, routine use of antibiotics in farm animals and close confinement in cages.\n\nThe party also aims to halt all fossil fuel projects and cancel existing licences.\n\nMr Ramsay said the Greens aim to achieve net zero \"years ahead\" of the current timetable.\n\n\"Protecting our climate and nature lies at the heart of our policies,\" he said.\n\nHealth and social care\n\nOn health, the Greens said they want to ensure a \"fully public, properly funded health and social care system\", promising to spend \u00a350bn per year by 2030.\n\nThe manifesto said elected MPs will push for a year-on-year reduction in waiting lists, guaranteed access to an NHS dentist, guaranteed rapid access to a GP, and an immediate boost to the pay of NHS staff.\n\nOther areas the party will focus on include increasing funding for mental health care and support a change in the law to legalise assisted dying for those with terminal diseases.\n\nOn social care, the party has pledged to introduce free personal care, increase carer pay rates and introduce a career structure for the sector.\n\nWelfare\n\nIn the manifesto's section on social support, the party pledges to \"tackle the cost-of-living crisis for the poorest in our society\".\n\nMeasures include increasing universal credit and legacy benefits by \u00a340 a week, abolishing the two-child benefit cap, introducing a universal basic income and giving disability benefits an immediate 5 per cent uplift.\n\nTax, spending and economy\n\nThe Green Party has pledged to raise taxes for the wealthiest in society and mend \"broken Britain\" in its election manifesto.\n\nA tax on multimillionaires and billionaires will be used to raise additional revenue of between \u00a330bn-70bn to help fund improvements to health, housing, transport and the green economy, the party said.\n\nIn its manifesto, the Greens also said \"privatisation has failed\" and promised to bring water companies, railways and the five big retail energy companies into state ownership.\n\nOther measures include a pledge to invest \u00a340bn a year to shift to a green economy, a \u00a312.4bn investment pledge in green skills and training, and a carbon tax to drive down emissions - all during the next parliament.\n\nMr Ramsay said they hope to create a fairer tax system. \"There is a conspiracy of silence between the main Westminster parties at this election,\" he said.\n\n\"Labour and the Conservatives would rather hide their plans for cuts to public services than confront the need for a fairer tax system that asks those with the broadest shoulders to pay more - including the very wealthiest in society, who have grown even wealthier over the last 14 years.\n\n\"We will push them to be braver, to be more ambitious, and to actually do what's necessary to fix our broken country and get us back on track.\"\n\nFarming\n\nFor more on agriculture, the Greens have pledged to \"work with farmers and other stakeholders to transform our food and farming system\".\n\nTheir manifesto includes measures such as almost tripling financial support for farmers to transition to nature-friendly farming, improving biodiversity and soil health, and linking farm payments to reduced use of pesticides.\n\nWorkers' rights\n\nIn the manifesto, the party said it plans to \"defend and extend workers' rights\" as it outlined measures such as repealing \"anti-union\" legislation and introducing a maximum 10:1 pay ratio.\n\nThe party will also push to increase the minimum wage to \u00a315 an hour no matter the age - up from its current rate of \u00a311.44 an hour for those aged 21 or over - and will move to introduce a four-day working week.\n\nTransport\n\nThe Greens' plans to cut carbon emissions include championing \"better, cheaper public transport\" by increasing annual public subsidies for rail and bus travel to \u00a310bn and investing an additional \u00a319bn to improve public transport by the end of the next Parliament.\n\nOther measures include a focus on active travel, with the party pledging to invest \u00a32.5bn a year in new cycleways and footpaths, and reducing traffic in residential areas to boost community use.\n\nOn aviation, elected MPs will push for a frequent-flyer levy, a ban on domestic flights for journeys that would take less than three hours by train and a halt to the expansion of new airport capacity.\n\nArts and culture\n\nGreen MPs will push for a \u00a35bn investment to support community sports, arts and culture, the manifesto said.\n\nThe party also backs efforts to keep local sports facilities, museums, theatres, libraries and art galleries open and thriving as well as ending VAT on cultural activities.\n\nMedia reform\n\nThe manifesto said the current media landscape is \"skewed by the dominance of billionaire and big-tech ownership\" with the aim of maximising profits.\n\nThe party said it will push for a change in the law so that no single individual or company can own more than 20 per cent of any media market and introduce all reforms proposed in the second part of the 2012 Leveson Report.\n\nForeign policy\n\nThe Green Party said it will seek to rejoin the European Union \"as soon as the political conditions are right\" as it unveiled its foreign policy objectives.\n\nIn the manifesto, the party said UK foreign policy \"should be based on shared commitments to democracy, peace, global solidarity and the protection of human rights\" as it pledged continued support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion.\n\nOn Israel and Palestine, the party said it will push for an immediate bilateral ceasefire as well as a \"durable political solution\".\n\nOn nuclear weapons, the party said it would see the UK begin the process of dismantling its nuclear weapons, cancel the Trident programme and remove all foreign nuclear weapons from UK soil.\n\nAnd on supporting Global South countries to tackle the climate crisis, the Greens back an increase to international aid to 1 per cent of gross national income (GNI) and an increase to climate finance to 1.5 per cent by 2033.\n\nRights and freedoms\n\nThe manifesto said the party will \"defend the Human Rights Act, the UK's membership of the European Convention on Human Rights and continued direct access to convention rights in the domestic courts\".\n\nOn political reform, the party will replace the first past the post system for parliamentary elections with a fair and proportional voting system, replace the House of Lords with an elected second chamber and provide votes for 16-year-olds.\n\nThe party said it will also campaign to end violence against women and girls, scrap legislation that erodes the right to protest and free expression, and campaign for the right of self-identification for trans and non-binary people.\n\nOther headline pledges including working to renew England's crumbling court system with a \u00a32.5bn investment and giving Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the choice to make their \"own decisions about their relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom\".\n\nImmigration\n\nIn its manifesto, the Green Party said it welcomes \"the contributions that migrants and refugees make to British society\" and would support safe routes to sanctuary for those fleeing persecution.\n\nThe party also said it will replace a \"dysfunctional Home Office\" with a new Department of Migration, end immigration detention, and allow asylum seekers to work while their applications are decided.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Only the Greens understand that the solutions to the climate crisis are also the solutions to the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\"The climate crisis is the most serious we face as a global community. Our commitment to you is that protecting our climate and nature lies at the heart of all of our policies.\"\n\nMr Ramsay added: \"We would stop all new fossil fuel projects in the UK and cancel those that have been recently licensed like Rosebank.\n\n\"We would be more ambitious than any other party when it comes to renewable energy, investing to ensure that our energy can come from wind and solar power. A secure energy supply and action on the climate crisis go hand in hand.\n\n\"Our investments in public transport, supporting the switch to electric vehicles and homes heated without fossil fuels means we would put this country on the path to being net zero years ahead of other parties.\"\n\nElsewhere, the party proposed a frequent-flyer levy, a rise in the minimum wage to \u00a315 and renewed its pledge to abolish tuition fees.\n\nWe want to be welcoming, promote social cohesion and support migrants to put down roots Green Party manifesto\n\nThe manifesto also vows to disband the \"dysfunctional\" Home Office and replace it with a new \"Department of Migration\" - separate from the criminal justice system - as part of commitments for fair treatment towards migrants and valuing the \"contributions\" they make to British society.\n\n\"We want to be welcoming, promote social cohesion and support migrants to put down roots,\" the document said.\n\nOn the party's plans to abolish immigration detention centres, Mr Ramsay said: \"We're talking about giving people accommodation in society, rather than being in a detention centre.\"\n\nOn defence, the party would maintain spending at 2% of GDP, but Mr Ramsay argued that nuclear weapons are an \"outdated system\".\n\n\"We need to make sure that the money we're putting into defence is used effectively on personnel, on the great work that our Army does for humanitarian work around the world and which we can continue to step up,\" he said.\n\nA Green Economic Transition plan is also included in the manifesto, which would aim to upgrade homes across the UK to increase their energy efficiency.\n\nOpening the manifesto launch, Brighton Pavilion candidate Sian Berry said that as a renter herself, ending the housing crisis is a \"top priority\" for the party.\n\nThe party has promised to provide 150,000 new social homes every year and a \"fair deal for renters\" by giving powers to local authorities to introduce rent control measures.\n\nIt is unlikely that the specific tax-raising measures they propose to help achieve all this would raise the sorts of sums they claim - and certainly not without real economic cost Helen Miller, Institute for Fiscal Studies\n\nAsked whether the party would consider building on the green belt to achieve its housing target, Ms Denyer said the 150,000 social homes a year by the end of the parliament would come from a \"mixture of building and buying from the private sector\".\n\nThe IFS said the party's proposal to restrict income tax relief on pension contributions would hit nurses and teachers, although its deputy director Helen Miller described some of the plans, such as closing loopholes within inheritance tax, as \"sensible\".\n\nMs Miller said: \"While some of the measures are targeted at the wealthy, the effects of the package would be much broader.\n\n\"Most obviously, it would be impossible to raise over \u00a390 billion from taxing carbon emissions without the effect being felt by everyone.\"\n\nShe added: \"It is unlikely that the specific tax-raising measures they propose to help achieve all this would raise the sorts of sums they claim - and certainly not without real economic cost.\"\n\nMr Ramsay said the party is \"realistic\" that it does \"not expect to form the next government\".\n\nHe said: \"When the Conservatives are booted out of Number 10 on July 4 and Labour take over, we plan to be there in Parliament in greater numbers to speak up for you on the issues that you care about.\"\n\nMr Ramsay added: \"Because with more Green MPs in Parliament, we will push Labour to stop backtracking on their promises.\"\n\nMs Berry confirmed that four party candidates had been de-selected because of antisemitism allegations.", "source":

From the Tories and Labour, we've been hearing a race to the bottom on tax.\n\n\"They think two pence off here and a penny off there will impress voters and they think that people won't cotton on that this means even more devastating cuts to public services like the NHS that we rely on every day.\"\n\nCaroline Lucas was previously the Green Party's only MP, she represented the Brighton Pavilion constituency since 2010.\n\nMr Ramsay said the party is \"realistic\" that it does \"not expect to form the next government\".\n\nHe said: \"When the Conservatives are booted out of Number 10 on July 4 and Labour take over, we plan to be there in parliament in greater numbers to speak up for you on the issues that you care about - like a revitalised NHS, bold action on the climate and a fair economy.\n\n\"Because with more Green MPs in parliament, we will push Labour to stop backtracking on their promises.\n\n\"We will be there to drive them to be braver, to be more ambitious, not to take timid baby steps towards change but to actually do what's necessary to fix our country and get us back on track.\"\n\nFinishing off their speech, he said: \"So this is our offer to voters - a manifesto that lays out exactly what real hope and real change looks like. An ambitious but realistic plan for the future that we can be proud of.\"\n\nConcerns had previously been raised surrounding a now-dropped policy to reduce medical interventions in childbirth.\n\nIn response to this, North Herefordshire candidate Ellie Chowns said: \"I'm really sorry that there's been any kind of anxiety caused about that, I think that's not representative of what we are standing for.\"\n\nShe added \"The Green Party has thousands of pages of policy which has been made over decades, we're the only party where policy making is done democratically by members.\n\n\"But that's not the policy that we're standing on at this election.\"\n\nBrighton Pavilion candidate Sian Berry confirmed that four candidates had been de-selected because of antisemitism allegations.\n\nShe told the PA news agency: \"Four candidates have had allegations and things they've said looked at, and have now stood aside or been asked to stand aside and replaced by other candidates in this election.\n\n\"Every case is looked at by an independent group within the Green Party. Candidates and leaders have no role in that, quite rightly.\n\n\"There are other candidates who have been reported and there may be proportionate things that are done with them as well, such as asking them to be educated. We take every single allegation like this properly seriously and we have good proper processes for dealing with it.\"\n\nConcerns had previously been raised surrounding a now-dropped policy to reduce medical interventions in childbirth.\n\nIn response to this, North Herefordshire candidate Ellie Chowns said: \"I'm really sorry that there's been any kind of anxiety caused about that, I think that's

Only the Greens understand that the solutions to the climate crisis are also the solutions to the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\"The climate crisis is the most serious we face as a global community. Our commitment to you is that protecting our climate and nature lies at the heart of all of our policies.\"\n\nMr Ramsay added: \"We would stop all new fossil fuel projects in the UK and cancel those that have been recently licensed like Rosebank.\n\n\"We would be more ambitious than any other party when it comes to renewable energy, investing to ensure that our energy can come from wind and solar power. A secure energy supply and action on the climate crisis go hand in hand.\n\n\"Our investments in public transport, supporting the switch to electric vehicles and homes heated without fossil fuels means we would put this country on the path to being net zero years ahead of other parties.\"\n\nElsewhere, the party proposed a frequent-flyer levy, a rise in the minimum wage to \u00a315 and renewed its pledge to abolish tuition fees.\n\nThe manifesto also vows to disband the \"dysfunctional\" Home Office and replace it with a new \"Department of Migration\" - separate from the criminal justice system - as part of commitments for fair treatment towards migrants and valuing the \"contributions\" they make to British society.\n\n\"We want to be welcoming, promote social cohesion and support migrants to put down roots,\" the document said.\n\nOn the party's plans to abolish immigration detention centres, Mr Ramsay said: \"We're talking about giving people accommodation in society, rather than being in a detention centre.\"\n\nOn defence, the party would maintain spending at 2% of GDP, but Mr Ramsay argued that nuclear weapons are an \"outdated system\".\n\n\"We need to make sure that the money we're putting into defence is used effectively on personnel, on the great work that our Army does for humanitarian work around the world and which we can continue to step up,\" he said.\n\nA Green Economic Transition plan is also included in the manifesto, which would aim to upgrade homes across the UK to increase their energy efficiency.\n\nOpening the manifesto launch, Brighton Pavilion candidate Sian Berry said that as a renter herself, ending the housing crisis is a \"top priority\" for the party.\n\nThe party has promised to provide 150,000 new social homes every year and a \"fair deal for renters\" by giving powers to local authorities to introduce rent control measures.\n\nAsked whether the party would consider building on the green belt to achieve its housing target, Ms Denyer said the 150,000 social homes a year by the end of the parliament would come from a \"mixture of building and buying from the private sector\".\n\nThe IFS said the party's proposal to restrict income tax relief on pension contributions would hit nurses and teachers, although its deputy director Helen Miller described some of the plans, such as closing loopholes within inheritance tax, as \"sensible\".\n\nMs Miller said: \"While some of the measures are targeted at the wealthy, the effects of the package would be much broader.\n\n\"Most obviously, it would be impossible to raise over \u00a390 billion from taxing carbon emissions without the effect being felt by everyone.\"\n\nShe added: \"It is unlikely that the specific tax-raising measures they propose to help achieve all this would raise the sorts of sums they claim - and certainly not without real economic cost.\"\n\nMr Ramsay said the party is \"realistic\" that it does \"not expect to form the next government\".\n\nHe

The Greens have also promised introduce a new wealth tax that could raise up to \u00a370bn.\n\nParty co-leaders Adrian Ramsay and Carla Denyer pledged to 'mend broken Britain' by overhauling the tax system. They said that the climate crisis has been 'pretty much absent from this election campaign so far' and pitched a new carbon tax to drive down emissions.\n\nAccording to the party, the new wealth tax on multimillionaires and billionaires could be used to fund improvements to health, housing, transport and the green economy. The Green Party has also promised to invest \u00a340bn a year to shift a green economy.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY: The Greater Manchester General Election 2024 Survey\n\nIt comes as the big political parties publish their general manifestos this week. The Lib Dems launched their manifesto on Monday (June 10), with the Tories unveilling their policies on Tuesday (June 11) while Labour's launch will take place on Thursday (June 13).\n\nNigel Farage's Reform UK will release its 'contract with the people' in full on June 17. George Galloway's Workers Party of Britain has already published its manifesto.\n\nHere are some of the main headlines from the Green Party manifesto.\n\nNHS and social care\n\nOn health, the Greens said they want to ensure a \"fully public, properly funded health and social care system\", promising to spend \u00a350 billion per year by 2030. The manifesto said elected MPs will push for a year-on-year reduction in waiting lists, guaranteed access to an NHS dentist, guaranteed rapid access to a GP, and an immediate boost to the pay of NHS staff.\n\nOther areas the party will focus on include increasing funding for mental health care and support a change in the law to legalise assisted dying for those with terminal diseases. On social care, the party has pledged to introduce free personal care, increase carer pay rates and introduce a career structure for the sector.\n\nCost of living and tax\n\nThe Green Party has pledged to raise taxes for the wealthiest in society and mend \"broken Britain\" in their election manifesto. The tax on multimillionaires and billionaires will be used to raise additional revenue of between \u00a330bn and \u00a370 billion to help fund improvements to health, housing, transport and the green economy, the party said.\n\nIn its manifesto, the Greens also said \"privatisation has failed\" and promised to bring water companies, railways and the five big retail energy companies into state ownership. Other measures include a pledge to invest \u00a340 billion a year to shift to a green economy, a \u00a312.4 billion investment pledge in green skills and training, and a carbon tax to drive down emissions - all during the next parliament.\n\nThe party has also proposed a Green Economic Transition plan to upgrade homes across the UK to increase their energy efficiency, which they say will make them warmer and cheaper to run. They said they will \"accelerate clean energy investment and delivery\" by cancelling recent oil and gas licences, removing all oil and gas subsidies and stopping all new fossil fuel extraction projects in the UK.\n\nImmigration\n\nIn its manifesto, the Green Party said it welcomes \"the contributions that migrants and refugees make to British society\" and would support safe routes to sanctuary for those fleeing persecution. The party also said it will replace a \"dysfunctional Home Office\" with a new Department of Migration, end immigration detention, and allow asylum seekers to work while their applications are decided.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Press

Somebody earning \u00a365,000 a year would pay \u00a3883 extra per year - the Greens say this would affect around 10% of workers.\n\nA wealth tax would be levied on individual taxpayers with assets above \u00a310 million at 1% and assets above \u00a31bn at 2% annually. The Green Party estimates less than 1% of households would pay this tax.\n\nCo-leader Carla Denyer, the Greens' candidate for Bristol Central, will say: \"Things can only get worse under Labour unless we dramatically change our tax system to raise money from those with the broadest shoulders.\n\n\"Young people, in particular, know just how broken Britain's frontline services are. The economy is not working for them. They have been priced out of the housing market and are struggling to fund their education.\n\n\"Now is the moment to be ambitious - not unrealistic - but ambitious. To be clear about the kind of country we want to live in, about how broken our public services are and the action that's needed to fix them.\"\n\nThe Green Party manifesto says it would also equate the rate of pension tax relief with the basic rate of income tax, such that everybody would only get 20% tax relief, and reform inheritance tax to close loopholes used by the \"super-rich\".\n\nThey would also introduce a carbon tax on businesses, starting at \u00a3120 per tonne emitted, rising to \u00a3500 per tonne over 10 years.\n\nThe money raised, together with borrowing, would be used for \"game-changing\" transformation in health, housing, transport and the green economy\n\nGreen Party co-leader and candidate for Waveney Valley, Adrian Ramsay, will say: \"There is a conspiracy of silence between the main Westminster parties at this election.\n\n\"Labour and the Conservatives would rather hide their plans for cuts to public services than confront the need for a fairer tax system that asks those with the broadest shoulders to pay more - including the very wealthiest in society, who have grown even wealthier over the last 14 years.\n\n\"If people are to have access to an NHS dentist or a GP appointment, if we are to create warm secure homes for all and fund the green transition to tackle the climate crisis and create the jobs of tomorrow, we must be honest today.\"\n\nThe party, whose only MP Caroline Lucas is standing down, added that it would not increase corporation tax., but would advocate for windfall taxes where there is evidence that market distortions are creating risk-free additional profits.\n\nAdditional employment-related policies will be added to this article when the Green Party manifesto is published in full later today.",

Capital gains tax would be aligned with income tax, and higher earners would pay more national insurance.\n\nIn a post-speech Q&A, Ramsay was asked if the party was comfortable asking people to pay more national insurance on incomes above \u00a350,000. He said someone on \u00a355,000 would pay an extra \u00a35 a week, calling this \"a modest amount that's affordable\".\n\nDenyer said the Greens were \"the only party being honest that that's the level of investment needed to get the kind of public services we need in this country\".\n\nThe Greens in England and Wales - the Scottish and Northern Ireland parties are largely independent - are running a heavily focused election campaign based around four key seats. Poll projections suggest they are on course to win two, which would double their number of MPs.\n\nRelated: 'People feel betrayed by Labour': Bristol's Green surge continues\n\nThe two most likely bets are Brighton Pavilion, held by Caroline Lucas since 2010 and now being contested by Si\u00e2n Berry, and Bristol Central, where Denyer could unseat Labour's Thangam Debbonaire.\n\nRamsay is contesting the new constituency of Waveney Valley, straddling Norfolk and Suffolk, where his main competitor is the Tories. The fourth target is North Herefordshire, where Ellie Chowns is aiming for the Tory-held seat.\n\nMuch of the message at the manifesto launch was aimed at voters who realised Labour were likely to win the election and would want a Green presence to push Keir Starmer's party on areas including poverty and the environment.\n\n\"Now we're not expecting to form the next government, we're realistic about that,\" Ramsay said. \"We will be there to drive them [Labour] to be braver, to be more ambitious, not to take baby steps towards change, but to actually do what's necessary to fix our country and get us back on track.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Ramsay",

He said a small number of millionaires may leave the UK as a result but insisted the super rich would stay.\n\nCurrently employees pay no National Insurance until they earn more than \u00a312,570, 8% on earnings of between \u00a312,570 and \u00a350,270, and 2% on earnings of above \u00a350,270 for the 2023/24 tax year.\n\nUnder the Greens' plans, the 8% rate would be paid on all wages above the upper earnings threshold.\n\nArun Advani, a wealth expert from the University of Warwick said raising this much through a wealth tax was credible, depending on the design.\n\nHowever, Institute for Fiscal Studies deputy director Helen Miller said the Greens were unlikely to raise as much revenue as expected.\n\n\"Overall borrowing would end up around \u00a380 billion a year higher,\" she said, adding a recurrent wealth tax would be tough to implement and \"would hit a lot of workers on not terribly high salaries - many nurses and teachers for example.\"\n\nAmong its proposals, the party set out plans to tackle the housing crisis and make homes warmer and cheaper to run by increasing energy efficiency.\n\nSian Berry, who is the party's candidate for the Brighton Pavilion constituency, said her passion was to get a fair deal for tenants \"so that renters don't have to live at someone else's mercy\".\n\nThe \"rental rollercoaster\" is \"destroying lives\" and bringing in rent controls, stabilising tenancies and ending no-fault evictions was \"not a pipe dream\", she said.\n\n\"Greens are proud of our policy to help end the crisis in rented housing by introducing rent controls.\n\n\"Decided locally and based on what the housing market looks like in the local community, this would allow all of us to make sure rents are affordable and stay connected with local earnings.\"\n\nThe party also pledged to provide 150,000 new \"genuinely affordable\" social homes every year.\n\nOn transport, the Greens say aviation is the fastest-growing source of CO2 emissions, and claim \"it's the wealthiest driving this trend\".\n\nThey plan to ban all on domestic flights for journeys that would take less than three hours by train.\n\nThey also want to stop airport expansions and introduce a frequent-flyer levy.\n\nThe Greens plan to field candidates in every constituency in England and Wales for the 4 July election. The Scottish Greens are a separate party.\n\nMr Ramsay also confirmed four out of 574 candidates have been replaced after the party launched an investigation into reports of antisemitic or extreme comments.\n\nHe said: \"Out of that huge number, there were four who were originally selected who are now not going forward and have had new candidates put in their place.\"\n\nWhen pressed over other candidates who had been investigated, he said: \"I can't recite every candidate\" adding that the process is \"separate from the leadership as a matter of good governance\".", "source": {"uri":

Capital gains tax would be aligned with income tax, and higher earners would pay more national insurance.\n\nRamsay said: \"Labour and the Conservatives would rather hide their plans for cuts to public services than confront the need for a fairer tax system that asks those with the broadest shoulders to pay more - including the very wealthiest in society, who have grown even wealthier over the last 14 years.\"\n\nMuch of the party's campaign is aimed at tempting traditional Labour voters, with the pledge that Green MPs would push a Keir Starmer government to be more bold.\n\nDenyer said: \"Things can only get worse under Labour unless we dramatically change our tax system to raise money from those with the broadest shoulders.\n\n\"Young people, in particular, know just how broken Britain's frontline services are. The economy is not working for them. They have been priced out of the housing market and are struggling to fund their education. Now is the moment to be ambitious.

The great British energy plan that replaces it is just around \u00a38bn across a whole Parliament compared to \u00a328bn per year - so it doesn't touch the sides.\"\n\nShe said transport and home heating are the hardest sectors to decarbonise and that is why the Green Party was focusing on \"a nationwide home installation programme\" and \"helping people to transition to fossil fuel free heating as quickly as possible\".\n\nDenyer accused Labour of being weak in these policy areas.\n\nShe argued this \"shows voters that Labour are not taking the climate crisis seriously - they are treating it as a bolt-on extra that they abandon when the going gets tough\".\n\nAsked if she would support Labour's plans to build new towns, she said that a focus on energy efficiency must be part of the plan for housebuilding.\n\n\"We do need to create more homes,\" she added. \"Our focus on that will be on creating affordable social homes - council housing association - and that will be through a mixture of new builds and supporting councils to buy the supply of private markets so that a greater proportion of the housing market is affordable.\"\n\nIn the Green's manifesto the party has said it would want to scrap the UK's nuclear weapons but remain a member of Nato, and would continue supporting Ukraine in its conflict against Russia.\n\nDenyer said the party \"would keep defence spending roughly steady\".\n\n\"We recognise the incredible importance of international solidarity and cooperation, especially at this time of increased threat,\" she said.\n\n\"And yes, we support our continued membership of Nato. That doesn't mean we agree with every approach they have taken.\n\n\"And certainly as Greens in government would be pushing for reforms to Nato in the way they operate. One of those reforms would be pushing for a policy of no first use of nuclear weapons.\"\n\nShe said while the Greens did not want to change the amount the UK is spending on defence, she would want to \"allocate parts of it differently, including looking after our servicemen and women\".\n\nThe Greens launched their manifesto in Brighton and Hove, where the party is defending the Brighton Pavilion seat of Caroline Lucas who is standing down after serving as the UK's only ever Green MP.\n\nFormer Green London mayoral candidate Sian Berry is standing in Brighton Pavilion to replace her.\n\nDenyer, who is hoping to be elected in Bristol Central, said the Greens were having a \"coming of age moment\" as they sought to coax over left-wing voters frustrated with the lack of public spending in Labour's plans.\n\nLaunching its general election manifesto, the party said it wanted to raise taxes for the wealthy to pump more money into health, housing, transport and transitioning to a green economy.\n\nCo-leader Adrian Ramsay says the Party is \"not expecting to run the next government\".\n\nBut, he says, if the Conservatives are booted out and Labour is elected to lead \"we plan to be there in parliament in greater numbers to speak about the issues you care about\".\n\n\"We will push Labour to stop backtracking on their promises, we will be there to drive them to be braver, to be more ambitious,\" he said.\n\nAdditional taxes on multimillionaires and billionaires will raise revenue of between \u00a330-70 billion to help fund improvements to health, housing, transport and the green economy, the party said.\n\nIn its manifesto, the Greens also said \"privatisation has failed\" and promised to bring water companies, railways and the five big retail energy companies into state ownership.\n\nOther measures include a pledge to invest \u00a340 billion a year to shift to a green economy, a \u00a312.4 billion investment pledge in green skills and training, and a carbon tax to drive down emissions - all during the next parliament.\n\nThe party also promised to provide 150,000 new social homes every year and a \"fair deal for renters\" by giving powers to local authorities to introduce rent control measures.\n\nDenyer and Ramsay batted off questions about whether the Greens have been blocking developments in areas of the country where they are in local government.\n\nDenyer said that claims the party had been voting against development was merely Labour campaigning and suggested it had been misleading.\n\nShe added that all their policies have been fully costed and, whilst they are \"ambitious\", the Greens are the only party being honest about the level of public investment needed.\n\nThe party accused the Conservatives and Labour of engaging in a \"conspiracy of silence\" over the cuts to public spending services - saying they would rather do this than overhaul the taxation system.\n\nThe co-leaders were also pressed on whether the party has a problem with antisemitism after four candidates were dropped due to accusations about their social media activity.\n\nRamsay said the Greens are standing 572 candidates across England and Wales - suggesting that the four who had been forced to step back were a very small proportion of that.\n\nDenyer also indicated that, despite calling for recent protest laws to be repealed, she did not believe that the convictions of climate protesters should be repealed.\n\nThe Green manifesto says the party wants to scrap both the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act and Public Order Act.\n\nAsked if this meant she would want to reverse penalties for those who have been convicted under the tougher protesting laws, Denyer said \"personally I don't think it is right for politicians to intervene (in matters of justice)... But we are clear these bills are disproportionate.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chloe_chaplain@inews.co.uk", "name": "Chloe

Only the Greens understand that the solutions to the climate crisis are also the solutions to the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\"The climate crisis is the most serious we face as a global community. Our commitment to you is that protecting our climate and nature lies at the heart of all of our policies.\"\n\n\"We would be more ambitious than any other party when it comes to renewable energy, investing to ensure that our energy can come from wind and solar power. A secure energy supply and action on the climate crisis go hand in hand.\n\n\"Our investments in public transport, support the switch to electric vehicles and homes heated without fossil fuels means we would put this country on path to being net zero years ahead of other parties.\n\n\"The science is clear, the desire from voters is clear. Now we need representatives in parliament who are ambitious enough to make it a reality.\"\n\nThe Green manifesto pledges a wealth tax of 1% annually on assets above \u00a310 million and of 2% on assets above \u00a31 billion.\n\nAlong with other tax measures - such as removing the upper earning limit that restricts the amount of national insurance paid by high earners - they party estimates it could raise an additional revenue of between \u00a350-70 billion.\n\nMs Denyer said her party would \"overhaul our tax system to make it fairer\".\n\nShe added: \"At the heart of this would be a tax on the very richest, the top 1% of people requiring them to pay a bit more into the pot. From the Tories and Labour, we've been hearing a race to the bottom on tax.\n\n\"They think two pence off here and a penny off there will impress voters and they think that people won't cotton on that this means even more devastating cuts to public services like the NHS that we rely on every day.\"\n\nThe Green's currently have just one MP, Caroline Lucas, who has represented the Brighton Pavilion constituency since 2010.\n\nMr Ramsay said the party is \"realistic\" that it does \"not expect to form the next government\".\n\nHe said: \"When the Conservatives are booted out of Number 10 on July 4 and Labour take over, we plan to be there in parliament in greater numbers to speak up for you on the issues that you care about - like a revitalised NHS, bold action on the climate and a fair economy.\n\n\"Because with more Green MPs in parliament, we will push Labour to stop backtracking on their promises.\n\n\"We will be there to drive them to be braver, to be more ambitious, not to take timid baby steps towards change but to actually do what's necessary to fix our country and get us back on track.\"\n\nFinishing off their speech, he said: \"So this is our offer to voters - a manifesto that lays out exactly what real hope and real change looks like. An ambitious but realistic plan for the future that we can be proud of.\"", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Capital gains tax would be aligned with income tax, and higher earners would pay more national insurance.\n\nIn a post-speech Q&A, Ramsay was asked if the party was comfortable asking people to pay more national insurance on incomes above \u00a350,000. He said someone on \u00a355,000 would pay an extra \u00a35 a week, calling this \"a modest amount that's affordable\".\n\nDenyer said the Greens were \"the only party being honest that that's the level of investment needed to get the kind of public services we need in this country\".\n\nThe Greens in England and Wales - the Scottish and Northern Ireland parties are largely independent - are running a heavily focused election campaign based around four key seats. Poll projections suggest they are on course to win two, which would double their number of MPs.\n\nThe two most likely bets are Brighton Pavilion, held by Caroline Lucas since 2010 and now being contested by Si\u00e2n Berry, and Bristol Central, where Denyer could unseat Labour's Thangam Debbonaire.\n\nRamsay is contesting the new constituency of Waveney Valley, straddling Norfolk and Suffolk, where his main competitor is the Tories. The fourth target is North Herefordshire, where Ellie Chowns is aiming for the Tory-held seat.\n\nMuch of the message at the manifesto launch was aimed at voters who realised Labour were likely to win the election and would want a Green presence to push Keir Starmer's party on areas including poverty and the environment.\n\n\"Now we're not expecting to form the next government, we're realistic about that,\" Ramsay said. \"We will be there to drive them [Labour] to be braver, to be more ambitious, not to take baby steps towards change, but to actually do what's necessary to fix our country

People earning under \u00a350,000 would not be affected.\"\n\nHe added it was a \"modest amount that will help create a fairer society\".\n\nRenters were promised greater protection with the Greens push to introduce rent controls, with the manifesto pledging a new stable rental tenancy and an end to no-fault evictions. Among the housing pledges is also a Green Economic Transition to deliver an 'unprecedented retrofit programme' to make homes warmer and cheaper to run.\n\nOne of its biggest policies is a pledge to invest over \u00a350bn per year by 2030 for health and social care, and an extra \u00a320bn capital investment for crumbling hospitals, primary care buildings and outdated equipment. The party has reiterated its commitment to a fully-funded NHS and among its pledges is a year-on-year reduction in waiting lists.\n\nA commitment to nationalise water, rail and the big five retail energy companies was made by Denyer during the manifesto speech, which received a loud applause from the audience. During her speech, she said that now was the moment to be \"ambitious, not unrealistic, but ambitions\".\n\nThe Greens have accused other parties of \"running away\" from solutions to the climate crisis, while emphasising that climate and nature are \"at the heart of our policies\".\n\nThe party said it will push the Government to transition to a zero-carbon society as soon as possible, and more than a decade ahead of the 2050 date. Among the clean energy investment pledges are to cancel recent fossil fuel licences, stop all new extraction projects in the UK and introduce a carbon tax.\n\nCo-leader Ramsay said the Greens don't expect to form the next government, but that getting Green MPs in Parliament will mean they can \"speak up for you on the issues you care about\".\n\nThe Greens have set their sights on getting four MPs into Parliament, most notably in Brighton and Bristol.", "source": {"uri": "leftfootforward.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Left Foot Forward"}, "authors": [{"uri":

urged today as it launched an election manifesto full of Corbynite policies.\n\nAiming its pitch squarely at progressive voters turned off by Starmer's Labour, the Greens pledged public ownership, higher taxes on the wealthiest and investment in public transport and housing.\n\nThe party's co-leader Carla Denyer, who is set fair to win Bristol Central from Labour on July 4, said the manifesto \"is based on investing to mend broken Britain and real hope and real change.\"\n\nSlamming Labour and the Tories for a \"race to the bottom on tax,\" she pledged \"a tax on the very richest, the top 1 per cent of people requiring them to pay a bit more into the pot.\"\n\nThe major parties' plans, she said, would mean \"even more devastating cuts to public services.\"\n\nThe Greens would invest \u00a350 billion in health and social care to get the NHS back on its feet, and spend \u00a329bn over five years to insulate homes.\n\nThey would also dramatically increase the social housing stock, building 150,000 new homes each year and ending the right-to-buy scheme which has so depleted social housing.\n\nIn a clear echo of Corbyn-era Labour, the Greens committed to taking the water companies, railways and the major energy monopolies into public ownership.\n\nCo-leader Adrian Ramsay said that both major parties were \"running away from their promises on the climate\" and added that \"only the Greens understand that the solutions to the climate crisis are the also the solutions to the cost-of-living crisis.\"\n\nHe promised that the Greens would cancel all fossil fuel projects in Britain and encourage a major switch to electric cars, alongside investing in public transport.\n\nMr Ramsay also called nuclear weapons \"an outdated system\" and said the money would be better spent on \"humanitarian work around the world\" undertaken by the army.\n\nOther major manifesto promises include scrapping tuition fees, a further Corbynite commitment, boosting school budgets and introducing a clean air Act to \"safeguard our children's health.\"\n\nThe Greens are currently polling at 6 per cent or more in voter preferences and are focusing their election hopes on four seats where the party is best-placed.\n\nThese include Brighton Pavilion, where Sian Berry is bidding to succeed Caroline Lucas, who is leaving the Commons after years as the party's sole representative there.", "source": {"uri": "morningstaronline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morning Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She stepped down as a councillor in 2024 to focus on her campaign to become MP.\n\nMr Ramsay was previously deputy leader of the Greens from 2008 to 2012 and has worked for environmental charities and as a senior lecturer in environmental politics and economics.\n\nHow did the Green Party do in the local elections?\n\nThe Green Party gained 74 councillors in the 2024 local elections, meaning it now holds 812 seats on more than 170 councils.\n\nHowever, it did not gain control of any new councils.\n\nIn 2023, the Greens took control of Mid Suffolk council - the first time the party has held a majority on a council in England.\n\nWhat about the last general election?\n\nThe Green Party took 2.7% of the vote in the 2019 general election with 865,697 votes.\n\nIt won a single seat in Brighton Pavilion, which it has held since 2010.\n\nWhat is the party hoping for in the general election?\n\nThe Greens are hoping to quadruple their number of MPs to four at this election.\n\nThe party is particularly hopeful about its candidates in four seats:\n\n* Brighton Pavilion - Sian Berry\n\n* Bristol Central - Carla Denyer\n\n* North Herefordshire - Ellie Chowns\n\n* Waveney Valley - Adrian Ramsay\n\nWhile the Greens are focusing on the constituencies where they bank on the highest chance of winning, they are aiming to stand candidates in every seat across England and Wales.\n\n\"That will mean everyone across the country will have the chance to vote Green,\" Ms Denyer said.\n\nThe full lists of candidates in the party's target seats are as follows:\n\nThe Green Party had about 54,000 members as of December 2021, according to the Electoral Commission.\n\nWhat is the history of the Green Party?\n\nThe Green Party marked its 50th anniversary in 2023 - although it started life in 1973 as People, it was renamed the Ecology Party two years later to reflect its environmental agenda.\n\nIn 1985 it officially became the Green Party, and four years later it gained two million votes in the European parliamentary elections.\n\nAlmost three decades after forming, the party's first member entered the House of Commons when Caroline Lucas won the Brighton Pavilion seat in 2010.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score":

nature itself\".\n\nHere are some of the headline policy proposals from the Greens.\n\n- The economy\n\nThe Green Party has pledged to raise taxes for the wealthiest in society and mend \"broken Britain\" in its election manifesto.\n\nA tax on multimillionaires and billionaires will be used to raise additional revenue of between \u00a330-70 billion to help fund improvements to health, housing, transport and the green economy, the party said.\n\nIn its manifesto, the Greens also said \"privatisation has failed\" and promised to bring water companies, railways and the five big retail energy companies into state ownership.\n\nOther measures include a pledge to invest \u00a340 billion a year to shift to a green economy, a \u00a312.4 billion investment pledge in green skills and training, and a carbon tax to drive down emissions - all during the next parliament.\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\n- Energy\n\nThe Green Party said it will \"accelerate clean energy investment and delivery\" by cancelling recent oil and gas licences such as those for the Rosebank oil and gas field, removing all oil and gas subsidies and stopping all new fossil fuel extraction projects in the UK.\n\nThe party also said it wants to see \"the phase-out of all nuclear energy\" and will push for wind to provide 70% of UK energy by 2030.\n\n- Nature\n\nOn nature, the party has outlined extensive plans to protect and restore the UK's environment by \"giving rights to nature itself\".\n\nThe party will work to end the sewage scandal, extend people's access to nature with a new English Right to Roam Act, and end the emergency authorisation of bee-killing pesticides.\n\nOn protecting animals and habitats, elected MPs will call for an end to all blood sports, badger culling, factory farming, routine use of antibiotics in farm animals and close confinement in cages.\n\nThe Greens pledge to work with farmers to 'transform our food and farming system\u00b4 (Danny Lawson/PA)\n\n- Farming\n\nFor more on agriculture, the Greens have pledged to \"work with farmers and other stakeholders to transform our food and farming system\".\n\nTheir manifesto includes measures such as almost tripling financial support for farmers to transition to nature-friendly farming, improving biodiversity and soil health, and linking farm payments to reduced use of pesticides.\n\n- Housing\n\nThe party has vowed to provide \"fairer, greener homes for all\", signalling that it wants to make the UK's housing crisis one of its key priorities for the next Parliament.\n\nUnder their plans, housebuilders would have to include solar panels and heat pumps on all new homes where appropriate and \u00a333 billion would be invested in insulating homes and other buildings over the next five years.\n\nThe party also promised to provide 150,000 new social homes every year and a \"fair deal for renters\" by giving powers to local authorities to introduce rent control measures.\n\n- Health and social care\n\nOn health, the Greens said they want to ensure a \"fully public, properly funded health and social care system\", promising to spend \u00a350 billion per year by 2030.\n\nThe manifesto said elected MPs will push for a year-on-year reduction in waiting lists, guaranteed access to an NHS dentist, guaranteed rapid access to a GP, and an immediate boost to the pay of NHS staff.\n\nThe Green Party manifesto said elected MPs will push for guaranteed rapid access to a GP (Anthony Devlin/PA)\n\nOther areas the party will focus on include increasing funding for mental health care and support a change in the law to legalise assisted dying for those with terminal diseases.\n\nOn social care, the party has pledged to introduce free personal care, increase carer pay rates and introduce a career structure for the sector.\n\n- Workers' rights\n\nIn the manifesto, the party said it plans to \"defend and extend workers' rights\" as it outlined measures such as repealing \"anti-union\" legislation and introducing a maximum 10:1 pay ratio.\n\nThe party will also push to increase the minimum wage to \u00a315 an hour no matter the age - up from its current rate of \u00a311.44 an hour for those aged 21 or over - and will move to introduce a four-day working week.\n\n- Welfare\n\nIn the manifesto's section on social support, the party pledges to \"tackle the cost-of-living crisis for the poorest in our society\".\n\nMeasures include increasing Universal Credit and legacy benefits by \u00a340 a week, abolishing the two-child benefit cap, introducing a universal basic income and giving disability benefits an immediate 5% uplift.\n\n- Transport\n\nThe Greens' plans to cut carbon emissions include championing \"better, cheaper public transport\" by increasing annual public subsidies for rail and bus travel to \u00a310bn and investing an additional \u00a319 billion to improve public transport by the end of the next Parliament.\n\nOther measures include a focus on active travel, with the party pledging to invest \u00a32.5bn a year in new cycleways and footpaths, and reducing traffic in residential areas to boost community use.\n\nOn aviation, elected MPs will push for a frequent-flyer levy, a ban on domestic flights for journeys that would take less than three hours by train and a halt to the expansion of new airport capacity.\n\nThe party is pledging to invest \u00a32.5bn a year in new cycleways and footpaths (Ben Birchall/PA)\n\n- Education\n\nThe Greens said the current education system \"operates like a production line rather than valuing their individual qualities\".\n\nThe manifesto said elected MPs will champion an increase in school funding of \u00a38 billion, ending tuition fees for higher education students, stopping high-stakes testing at schools and abolishing Ofsted.\n\n- Arts and culture\n\nGreen MPs will push for a \u00a35 billion investment to support community sports, arts and culture, the manifesto said.\n\nThe party also backs efforts to keep local sports facilities, museums, theatres, libraries and art galleries open and thriving as well as ending VAT on cultural activities.\n\n- Media reform\n\nThe manifesto said the current media landscape is \"skewed by the dominance of billionaire and big-tech ownership\" with the aim of maximising profits.\n\nThe party said it will push for a change in the law so that no single individual or company can own more than 20% of any media market and introduce all reforms proposed in the second part of the 2012 Leveson Report.\n\n- Foreign policy\n\nThe Green Party said it will seek to rejoin the European Union \"as soon as the political conditions are right\" as it unveiled its foreign policy objectives.\n\nIn the manifesto, the party said UK foreign policy \"should be based on shared commitments to democracy, peace, global solidarity and the protection of human rights\" as it pledged continued support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion.\n\nOn Israel and Palestine, the party said it will push for an immediate bilateral ceasefire as well as a \"durable political solution\".\n\nOn nuclear weapons, the party said it would see the UK begin the process of dismantling its nuclear weapons, cancel the Trident programme and remove all foreign nuclear weapons from UK soil.\n\nAnd on supporting Global South countries to tackle the climate crisis, the Greens back an increase to international aid to 1% of gross national income (GNI) and an increase to climate finance to 1.5% by 2033.\n\n- Rights and freedoms\n\nThe manifesto said the party will \"defend the Human Rights Act, the UK's membership of the European Convention on Human Rights and continued direct access to convention rights in the domestic courts\".\n\nOn political reform, the party will replace the first past the post system for parliamentary elections with a fair and proportional voting system, replace the House of Lords with an elected second chamber and provide votes for 16-year-olds.\n\nThe party said it will also campaign to end violence against women and girls, scrap legislation that erodes the right to protest and free expression, and campaign for the right of self-identification for trans and non-binary people.\n\nOther headline pledges including working to renew England's crumbling court system with a \u00a32.5bn investment and giving Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the choice to make their \"own decisions about their relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom\".\n\n- Immigration\n\nThe Green Party said it would replace the Home Office with a new Department of Migration (Rick Findler/PA)\n\nIn its manifesto, the Green Party said it welcomes \"the contributions that migrants and refugees make to British society\" and would support safe routes to sanctuary for those fleeing persecution.\n\nThe party also said it will replace a \"dysfunctional Home Office\" with a new Department of Migration, end immigration detention, and allow asylum seekers to work while their applications are decided.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Other pledges included plans to end the \"hostile environment\" faced by migrants and refugees, and to bring in a four-day working week.\n\nThe party also made several commitments that would affect personal finances, if it gets elected. As well as a wealth tax, it wants to implement a \"maximum 10:1 pay ratio\" for businesses and bring in a universal basic income.\n\nThe news comes after the Conservative Party unveiled its manifesto. On Tuesday (11 June), Rishi Sunak announced \u00a317bn in tax cuts, including a further cut to National Insurance and the introduction of the state pension triple lock plus.\n\nIt also follows the Liberal Democrat manifesto launch on Monday (10 June), during which Sir Ed Davey's party promised to make the UK a fairer place to live and work. Key pledges included closing capital gains tax loopholes and taxing share buybacks.\n\nLabour is set to publish its manifesto on Thursday (13 June). Sir Keir Starmer's party has already revealed a Freedom to Buy scheme and plans to add VAT to private school fees.\n\nThe Greens believe they can raise an extra \u00a350bn to \u00a370bn a year by reforming personal taxes. Pointing out that the number of billionaires in the UK has risen from 29 to 171 since 2010, they say they want to \"fairly tax excessive concentrations of wealth\" to fund public services and simplify the wider tax system.\n\nOne of its main policies is a new wealth tax. This levy would come in at a rate of 1% on all assets above \u00a310m and 2% on assets over \u00a31bn. The party has also targeted the wealthy by pledging to align the rates of income tax and capital gains tax (CGT). It also wants to align tax rates on investment income with income tax and National Insurance Contribution (NIC) rates for employees.\n\nA further change to NICs that would be brought in if the party gets elected would see the main 8% rate extended beyond the upper earnings limit (\u00a350,270). At present, anything above the threshold is taxed at 2%. This would mean that somebody earning \u00a355,000 a year would pay \u00a35.46 a week more in tax (\u00a3283.74 extra a year), while a worker on \u00a365,000 a year would pay an extra \u00a317 a week (\u00a3883 a year).\n\nThe Greens also want to equate the rate of pension tax relief with the basic rate of income tax. It says this means that everyone would only get a tax relief of 20%. The manifesto also includes a vague pledge to close inheritance tax loopholes that are exploited by the wealthy. Frequent flyers would face a punitive levy on their fares, while the party would seek to ban domestic flights where the journey can be undertaken in less than three hours by train.\n\nBut the manifesto does include one non-punitive tax measure. It says it would end VAT on cultural activities. This measure would lower the prices of, for example, museum admission and tickets to gigs in pubs.\n\nAway from personal finance, the party's tax pledges include the introduction of a carbon tax. Set at \u00a3120 per tonne of emissions before climbing to a maximum of \u00a3500 per tonne over a 10-year period, it expects the levy would raise an extra \u00a380bn. The policy, which is aimed at making decarbonisation a cheaper alternative for business compared to continuing with the status quo, would also initially align with other fossil fuel taxes, such as fuel duty and payments under the emissions trading scheme.\n\nThe manifesto promises to not hike the main rates of corporation tax, and says the Greens would continue a windfall tax on energy companies as well as bring in one on banks, which have benefited from high interest rates. These measures would raise \u00a39bn a year by the next election, they claim. The Greens would also advocate for further windfall taxes in other sectors if extra profits caused by \"market distortions\" come in as being \"risk free\".\n\nAs with the other parties, the Greens have earmarked more funding for HMRC to tackle tax avoidance and evasion. But, unlike the other parties, it has not set a figure for how much it plans to raise through this crackdown.\n\nThe Green manifesto suggests the party would move away from the triple lock to a double lock system. It says it would ensure that pensions are \"always uprated\" in line with inflation and would keep pace with wage rises. It comes amid warnings that the triple lock system is unsustainable in its current form.\n\nIn terms of a Green Party government's stewardship of the economy, its manifesto says it's \"prepared to borrow to invest. It suggests the other major parties are \"trapped in a self-imposed fiscal straitjacket\" and following a \"false economy\".\n\nJustifying its stance, the party says investing in the climate now would \"save vast costs in the future\". It adds that raising public services to a \"decent\" standard and ensuring infrastructure is \"fit-for-purpose\" are crucial for the future.\n\nBut, it also acknowledges that public spending can only go so far before it triggers \"dangerous levels of inflation\". So, the party's \"overriding fiscal rule\" would be to ensure inflation is not unduly increased by a Green government's expenditure.\n\nSince the Lib Dems made several ambitious green housing pledges in their manifesto, all eyes have been on what the Green Party would announce. Its manifesto goes slightly further.\n\nThe party wants all new homes to meet Passivhaus - or equivalent - standards, and says new builds must come with solar panels and heat pumps \"where appropriate\". Existing properties will go through a 10-year \"street-by-street\" retrofitting programme to boost insulation to EPC B standard or above (at a cost of \u00a329bn). They will also be able to benefit from incentives to install low-carbon heating systems (costing \u00a39bn). The party says it will create 150,000 new social homes a year through new construction and refurbishing older housing stock, whilst ending 'Right to Buy' so that social housing is kept \"in perpetuity\" for local communities.\n\nFor renters, the Green Party plans to allow local authorities to be able to control rents if they become unaffordable for local people. It wants to ban no-fault evictions, and to give tenants the right to demand energy efficiency improvements. These improvements would be funded by taxpayer loans, which would be repaid by landlords. The party has also committed to creating \"private residential tenancy boards\" that would provide an \"informal, cheap and speedy\" forum to resolve disputes between tenants and landlords.\n\nIn terms of property taxes, the party aspires to move away from \"regressive\" council tax and towards a Land Value Tax, which would ensure that owners of the \"most valuable and largest land holdings\" would pay the most. It would progress towards this goal by first re-evaluating council tax bands and then undertaking a survey of all landholdings.\n\nThe Green Party says it wants to make the financial services sector \"a force for good\" by directing finance towards progressive businesses. It says all UK banking licence holders will have to present an investment strategy that will set out a clear route to divestment from fossil fuel-related assets by 2030. Non-bank financial institutions, such as pension funds, will also have to remove fossil fuel assets from their portfolios by the end of the decade.\n\nIt also wants to alter the Bank of England's mandate so that its efforts are centred on funding a transition towards a sustainable economy and mapping out a greener banking system - alongside its existing responsibility to keep inflation in check.\n\nIndividual investors would also be encouraged to move away from fossil fuel equities under a Green government. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) would be tasked with developing goals to eliminate all fossil fuel-related stocks from the UK stock market. It would also bar any new fossil fuel listings or share allocations.\n\nElsewhere, the party says it would set up regional mutual banks in a bid to \"drive investment in decarbonisation and local economic sustainability\". Communities would also be given ownership of \"local sustainable energy infrastructure\", like wind farms.\n\nAs you'd imagine from the Green manifesto, there are a lot of commitments to move the UK towards a \"zero-carbon society\". For example, the party wants wind to provide around 70% of the nation's energy by 2030.\n\nThe party also wants to bring nuclear power to an end and invest in the country's energy storage capacity and more efficient electricity distribution. Its community ownership model (see above) would lower energy bills, it claims, by allowing local areas to sell excess energy.\n\nHowever, its energy bill cutting measures are almost-entirely focused on household energy efficiency measures (see property).", "source": {"uri": "moneyweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyWeek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "henry_sandercock@moneyweek.com", "name":

It's a look at what things could be like and soon.\"\n\nThe pair highlighted key polices such as investment in healthcare, tax reform, affordable housing and climate policy.\n\nOn taxes, Carla Denyer said: \"We can't go on in a way where most people are working harder yet getting poorer while inequality keeps growing.\n\n\"We would overhaul our tax system to make it fairer.\n\n\"On the doorstep, people are telling us they want something to be done about our broken Britain.\n\n\"We have the courage to say we will change the tax system to make it fairer.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Live updates as Green Party chooses Hove to launch manifesto\n\nOn healthcare investment, Ramsay promised to put \u00a350 billion into health and social care and to \"say a categorical no to privatisation\".\n\nAnother key focus was housing, where they pledged to provide \"genuinely affordable housing\" and to create 150,000 social houses each year.\n\nDenyer said: \"We would end the right-to-buy scheme that takes so many homes out of circulation.\n\n\"Our energy bills are sky high.\n\n\"We will invest \u00a330 million to reduce emissions and bring energy bills down for good.\"\n\nThe party's main focus is the climate crisis.\n\nRamsay said: \"If you look at the other parties, the climate crisis has been pretty much absent from their campaigns.\n\n\"Our commitment to you is that the protection of our climate lies at the heart of all our policies.\n\n\"We will strive every single day to take the action that is needed.\"\n\nPolicies on climate include stopping all new fossil fuel extraction projects, including recent licences, introducing a carbon tax on fossil fuel imports and ensuring wind produces 70 per cent of the UK's electricity by 2030.\n\nCarla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay on stage (Image: Lucy Hunt / The Argus)\n\nThe Greens were realistic about their General Election prospects, stating that they didn't expect to form the next government but \"when the Conservatives are booted out and Labour take over, we plan to be there in greater numbers to speak about the issues you care about\".\n\nRamsay said: \"With more Green MPs, we will push Labour to stop backtracking on their policies, to drive them to be braver and ambitious, to do what's necessary to fix our country and get us back on track.\"\n\nThe presentation was followed by questions from the press on issues including defence investment, the cost-of-living crisis and taxes.\n\nThe co-leaders were asked: \"There's a lot of spending in this manifesto. Are you really being honest that you can raise all of this?\"\n\nDenyer answered: \"Our manifesto is fully costed; I think the Green Party was more ready for this election than many others.\n\n\"We do have ambitious spending commitments and the party is the only one being honest about what is needed to change things for this county.\"\n\nFollowing the Prime Minister's revelation that he went without Sky TV to fund his private education, one person asked: \"Rishi Sunak said that he had to go without Sky TV when he was growing up, what did you have to go without?\"\n\nDenyer replied: \"I also went without Sky TV, my parents had second-hand cars. I'm not trying to elicit any tears here as I had a fairly comfortable childhood.\"\n\nRamsay said: \"I had a similar upbringing,\" before jokingly adding, \"I went without a pet for most of my childhood.\"\n\nAfter the conference, The Argus caught up with Brighton Pavilion candidate Sian Berry, who hopes to take over from Caroline Lucas as Green MP.\n\nSian Berry, left, hopes to take over from former MP Caroline Lucas, right, as Green MP for Brighton Pavilion (Image: Lucy Hunt / The Argus)\n\nSian told us about the key issues Brighton voters have raised on the doorsteps, such as the NHS, renting conditions and sewage.\n\nShe said: \"We hear about the NHS a lot and the difficulty they have accessing it.\n\n\"They do not want the values and reputation of the NHS to be undermined.\n\n\"We are passionate about maintaining the NHS as a public service.\"\n\nShe also spoke highly of former Brighton Pavilion MP, Caroline Lucas.\n\nShe said: \"She has been this very strong, independent voice for the city, and an incredible advocate in Pavilion.\n\n\"She has been a great constituency MP.\"\n\nThe Argus also spoke to Adrian Ramsay about the Greens' prospects in Brighton and Hove.\n\nGreen Party co-leaders Carla Denyer and Adrian Ramsay (Image: Lucy Hunt / The Argus)\n\nHe said: \"The Green Party vote in Brighton has increased at each election.\n\n\"Caroline Lucas has shown that she is a really strong constituency MP, representing residents as well as shifting the dial of the debate in Parliament to press for action.\n\n\"Sian will be an equally strong Green MP. She's got the credentials and experience of being an elected Green over a long period of time and will be a fantastic MP for Brighton Pavilion.\"\n\nAs Brighton previously had a Green council, we asked Adrian what he was proud of during the time in office and what the party could take forward nationally.\n\nHe said: \"The council built 500 new council homes under the Greens.\n\n\"Green councils around the country are pursuing opportunities to build new council homes to a high environmental standard.\n\n\"We want local councils to be given more funding to build more council homes and more opportunities to borrow for council house building.\"", "source": {"uri": "theargus.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Argus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Beth Rigby and the studio audience.\n\nPrior to the live broadcast, Mr Sunak is expected to be out campaigning in North East Lincolnshire following the launch of the Tories' manifesto on Tuesday, which proposed to halve immigration and tax cuts totalling \u00a317.2 billion.\n\n- Potholes, be gone\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Keir will be championing Labour's pledge to spend \u00a3380 million fixing one million potholes every year.\n\nThe leader will visit the North East alongside shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh, who has accused the Tories of failing drivers, adding that Labour is the only party \"truly on the side of drivers\".\n\nUnder the proposals, Labour has promised to fund local authorities to improve the condition of local roads and break down planning barriers to ensure vital upgrades to infrastructure is delivered on time and to budget.\n\nLabour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer during a visit to Whale Hill Primary School in Eston, Middlesbrough (Stefan Rousseau/PA)\n\nThe party has also committed to tackle soaring car insurance costs by calling in regulators to crack down on the causes of soaring costs.\n\nThe pledges will be funded by deferring the A27 bypass, instead spending the \u00a3320 million on repairs across the country.\n\n- So long, farewell Ofwat\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey will be championing the party's plans for a new clean water authority to replace Ofwat as he pays a visit to the West Midlands and the Home Counties.\n\nThe party has promised to \"end the sewage scandal\" by transforming water firms into public benefit companies, banning bonuses for water bosses until discharges and leaks stop, and replacing Ofwat with a new regulator.\n\nLiberal Democrats leader Sir Ed Davey during a visit to Thorpe Park in Chertsey, Surrey (Lucy North/PA)\n\n- Greens hit the wealthy with taxes\n\nThe Green Party will pledge to raise taxes for the wealthiest in society and mend \"broken Britain\" in its election manifesto.\n\nA tax on multimillionaires and billionaires will be used to fund improvements to health, housing, transport and the green economy, the party said.\n\nAhead of the manifesto launch in Brighton and Hove, the

manifesto at a glance", "body": "Here are some of the headline policy proposals from the Greens.\n\n- The economy\n\nThe Green Party has pledged to raise taxes for the wealthiest in society and mend \"broken Britain\" in its election manifesto.\n\nA tax on multimillionaires and billionaires will be used to raise additional revenue of between \u00a330-70 billion to help fund improvements to health, housing, transport and the green economy, the party said.\n\nIn its manifesto, the Greens also said \"privatisation has failed\" and promised to bring water companies, railways and the five big retail energy companies into state ownership.\n\nOther measures include a pledge to invest \u00a340 billion a year to shift to a green economy, a \u00a312.4 billion investment pledge in green skills and training, and a carbon tax to drive down emissions - all during the next parliament.\n\n- Energy\n\nThe Green Party said it will \"accelerate clean energy investment and delivery\" by cancelling recent oil and gas licences such as those for the Rosebank oil and gas field, removing all oil and gas subsidies and stopping all new fossil fuel extraction projects in the UK.\n\nThe party also said it wants to see \"the phase-out of all nuclear energy\" and will push for wind to provide 70% of UK energy by 2030.\n\n- Nature\n\nOn nature, the party has outlined extensive plans to protect and restore the UK's environment by \"giving rights to nature itself\".\n\nThe party will work to end the sewage scandal, extend people's access to nature with a new English Right to Roam Act, and end the emergency authorisation of bee-killing pesticides.\n\nOn protecting animals and habitats, elected MPs will call for an end to all blood sports, badger culling, factory farming, routine use of antibiotics in farm animals and close confinement in cages.\n\n- Farming\n\nFor more on agriculture, the Greens have pledged to \"work with farmers and other stakeholders to transform our food and farming system\".\n\nTheir manifesto includes measures such as almost tripling financial support for farmers to transition to nature-friendly farming, improving biodiversity and soil health, and linking farm payments to reduced use of pesticides.\n\n- Housing\n\nThe party has vowed to provide \"fairer, greener homes for all\", signalling that it wants to make the UK's housing crisis one of its key priorities for the next Parliament.\n\nUnder their plans, housebuilders would have to include solar panels and heat pumps on all new homes where appropriate and \u00a333 billion would be invested in insulating homes and other buildings over the next five years.\n\nThe party also promised to provide 150,000 new social homes every year and a \"fair deal for renters\" by giving powers to local authorities to introduce rent control measures.\n\n- Health and social care\n\nOn health, the Greens said they want to ensure a \"fully public, properly funded health and social care system\", promising to spend \u00a350 billion per year by 2030.\n\nThe manifesto said elected MPs will push for a year-on-year reduction in waiting lists, guaranteed access to an NHS dentist, guaranteed rapid access to a GP, and an immediate boost to the pay of NHS staff.\n\nOther areas the party will focus on include increasing funding for mental health care and support a change in the law to legalise assisted dying for those with terminal diseases.\n\nOn social care, the party has pledged to introduce free personal care, increase carer pay rates and introduce a career structure for the sector.\n\n- Workers' rights\n\nIn the manifesto, the party said it plans to \"defend and extend workers' rights\" as it outlined measures such as repealing \"anti-union\" legislation and introducing a maximum 10:1 pay ratio.\n\nThe party will also push to increase the minimum wage to \u00a315 an hour no matter the age - up from its current rate of \u00a311.44 an hour for those aged 21 or over - and will move to introduce a four-day working week.\n\n- Welfare\n\nIn the manifesto's section on social support, the party pledges to \"tackle the cost-of-living crisis for the poorest in our society\".\n\nMeasures include increasing Universal Credit and legacy benefits by \u00a340 a week, abolishing the two-child benefit cap, introducing a universal basic income and giving disability benefits an immediate 5% uplift.\n\n- Transport\n\nThe Greens' plans to cut carbon emissions include championing \"better, cheaper public transport\" by increasing annual public subsidies for rail and bus travel to \u00a310bn and investing an additional \u00a319 billion to improve public transport by the end of the next Parliament.\n\nOther measures include a focus on active travel, with the party pledging to invest \u00a32.5bn a year in new cycleways and footpaths, and reducing traffic in residential areas to boost community use.\n\nOn aviation, elected MPs will push for a frequent-flyer levy, a ban on domestic flights for journeys that would take less than three hours by train and a halt to the expansion of new airport capacity.\n\n- Education\n\nThe Greens said the current education system \"operates like a production line rather than valuing their individual qualities\".\n\nThe manifesto said elected MPs will champion an increase in school funding of \u00a38 billion, ending tuition fees for higher education students, stopping high-stakes testing at schools and abolishing Ofsted.\n\n- Arts and culture\n\nGreen MPs will push for a \u00a35 billion investment to support community sports, arts and culture, the manifesto said.\n\nThe party also backs efforts to keep local sports facilities, museums, theatres, libraries and art galleries open and thriving as well as ending VAT on cultural activities.\n\n- Media reform\n\nThe manifesto said the current media landscape is \"skewed by the dominance of billionaire and big-tech ownership\" with the aim of maximising profits.\n\nThe party said it will push for a change in the law so that no single individual or company can own more than 20% of any media market and introduce all reforms proposed in the second part of the 2012 Leveson Report.\n\n- Foreign policy\n\nThe Green Party said it will seek to rejoin the European Union \"as soon as the political conditions are right\" as it unveiled its foreign policy objectives.\n\nIn the manifesto, the party said UK foreign policy \"should be based on shared commitments to democracy, peace, global solidarity and the protection of human rights\" as it pledged continued support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion.\n\nOn Israel and Palestine, the party said it will push for an immediate bilateral ceasefire as well as a \"durable political solution\".\n\nOn nuclear weapons, the party said it would see the UK begin the process of dismantling its nuclear weapons, cancel the Trident programme and remove all foreign nuclear weapons from UK soil.\n\nAnd on supporting Global South countries to tackle the climate crisis, the Greens back an increase to international aid to 1% of gross national income (GNI) and an increase to climate finance to 1.5% by 2033.\n\n- Rights and freedoms\n\nThe manifesto said the party will \"defend the Human Rights Act, the UK's membership of the European Convention on Human Rights and continued direct access to convention rights in the domestic courts\".\n\nOn political reform, the party will replace the first past the post system for parliamentary elections with a fair and proportional voting system, replace the House of Lords with an elected second chamber and provide votes for 16-year-olds.\n\nThe party said it will also campaign to end violence against women and girls, scrap legislation that erodes the right to protest and free expression, and campaign for the right of self-identification for trans and non-binary people.\n\nOther headline pledges including working to renew England's crumbling court system with a \u00a32.5bn investment and giving Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the choice to make their \"own decisions about their relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom\".\n\n- Immigration\n\nIn its manifesto, the Green Party said it welcomes \"the contributions that migrants and refugees make to British society\" and would support safe routes to sanctuary for those fleeing persecution.\n\nThe party also said it will replace a \"dysfunctional Home Office\" with a new Department of Migration, end immigration detention, and allow asylum seekers to work while their applications are decided.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

manifesto at a glance", "body": "The Green Party have launched their General Election manifesto, with promises to stop \"all new fossil fuel projects\", overhaul the tax system and give \"rights to nature itself\".\n\nHere are some of the headline policy proposals from the Greens.\n\n- The economy\n\nThe Green Party has pledged to raise taxes for the wealthiest in society and mend \"broken Britain\" in its election manifesto.\n\nA tax on multimillionaires and billionaires will be used to raise additional revenue of between \u00a330-70 billion to help fund improvements to health, housing, transport and the green economy, the party said.\n\nIn its manifesto, the Greens also said \"privatisation has failed\" and promised to bring water companies, railways and the five big retail energy companies into state ownership.\n\nOther measures include a pledge to invest \u00a340 billion a year to shift to a green economy, a \u00a312.4 billion investment pledge in green skills and training, and a carbon tax to drive down emissions - all during the next parliament.\n\nThe Green Party said it will \"accelerate clean energy investment and delivery\" by cancelling recent oil and gas licences such as those for the Rosebank oil and gas field, removing all oil and gas subsidies and stopping all new fossil fuel extraction projects in the UK.\n\nThe party also said it wants to see \"the phase-out of all nuclear energy\" and will push for wind to provide 70% of UK energy by 2030.\n\n- Nature\n\nOn nature, the party has outlined extensive plans to protect and restore the UK's environment by \"giving rights to nature itself\".\n\nThe party will work to end the sewage scandal, extend people's access to nature with a new English Right to Roam Act, and end the emergency authorisation of bee-killing pesticides.\n\nOn protecting animals and habitats, elected MPs will call for an end to all blood sports, badger culling, factory farming, routine use of antibiotics in farm animals and close confinement in cages.\n\nFor more on agriculture, the Greens have pledged to \"work with farmers and other stakeholders to transform our food and farming system\".\n\nTheir manifesto includes measures such as almost tripling financial support for farmers to transition to nature-friendly farming, improving biodiversity and soil health, and linking farm payments to reduced use of pesticides.\n\n- Housing\n\nThe party has vowed to provide \"fairer, greener homes for all\", signalling that it wants to make the UK's housing crisis one of its key priorities for the next Parliament.\n\nUnder their plans, housebuilders would have to include solar panels and heat pumps on all new homes where appropriate and \u00a333 billion would be invested in insulating homes and other buildings over the next five years.\n\nThe party also promised to provide 150,000 new social homes every year and a \"fair deal for renters\" by giving powers to local authorities to introduce rent control measures.\n\n- Health and social care\n\nOn health, the Greens said they want to ensure a \"fully public, properly funded health and social care system\", promising to spend \u00a350

Here are some of its main points.\n\nMore tax, more spend\n\nUnlike the Conservatives and Labour, the Greens are unapologetic in opting out of what they call a \"race to the bottom\" on tax. Taxes would go up under their policies - though mainly for wealthier people.\n\nTo finance a range of public policies including insulating buildings, higher benefits and more money to the NHS and public spending, the party would levy a wealth tax on people worth \u00a310m or more, increase national insurance, and put capital gains tax at the same rate as income tax.\n\nDo all the sums add up? At the launch event the party's co-leader Adrian Ramsay said the manifesto was fully costed. There is not, however, a page of costings in the document.\n\nBuild, build, build\n\nThe launch event was opened by the party's Brighton Pavilion candidate, Si\u00e2n Berry, who noted that she was and had always been a renter, \"at the mercy of a system that can turn on me at any moment\".\n\nThe Greens' answers include building more social rent homes, acquiring more from the private sector, insulating homes so they are warmer, rent controls, and letting councils requisition empty properties or those without proper insulation.\n\nThere is also a section in the manifesto about ensuring any new homes have access to sufficient local infrastructure and no overly adverse environmental impacts. This could be seen as a nimby's charter for a party that runs or co-runs a series of councils - something denied by Ramsay and his co-leader Carla Denyer.\n\nTackling the cost of living\n\nDenyer said the manifesto aimed to address \"an economy where most people are working harder and yet getting poorer\". As well as investment in areas such as skills training, policies include a \u00a315-an-hour minimum wage, improved employment rights and a four-day working week.\n\nOn social security, plans include a \u00a340 weekly upgrade to universal credit and parallel legacy benefits, abolishing the two-child benefit cap and the bedroom tax, and in the longer term, introducing a universal basic income.\n\nA green society\n\nThe party has long moved on from almost entirely campaigning on nature and the environment, but this remains a priority.\n\nPolicies in the manifesto include phasing out fossil fuels and nuclear energy, and aiming for wind to provide 70% of the UK's electricity by 2030. Farmers would be heavily incentivised to promote biodiversity and use fewer pesticides.\n\nOn transport, there is little of the \"plan for drivers\", with instead mass spending on public transport and a promised \u00a32.5bn a year for building walking and cycling infrastructure.\n\nWe're sober and sensible, really\n\nWhile the Greens' policies are certainly more radical than those of the bigger parties, the manifesto launch was notably short on controversy or contentious ideas, as exemplified by the sensible figures of Denyer and Ramsay.\n\nA question about abandoning nuclear weapons was answered less in terms of a moral choice than one of cost and practicality; asked if the Greens believed jailed climate protesters should be freed, Denyer said it was not up to politicians to get involved in individual court cases.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Ramsay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Ramsay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital gains tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_and_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England and Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race to the bottom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wealth tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carla_Denyer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carla Denyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si\u00e2n_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Si\u00e2n Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Pavilion_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton Pavilion (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Universal basic income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedroom_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bedroom tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Universal Credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cycling infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pesticide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labor rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Building Types", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/ad9d5f71815f56e24ddaf20c69e8c1d9", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644534", "eventUri": "eng-9644534", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

It's only right that they pay more towards upgrading our homes, infrastructure and public services.\"\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned the party's manifesto proposals will come with a \"real economic cost\" and increase disincentives to work.\n\nIts deputy director, Helen Miller, described some plans - such as closing loopholes within inheritance tax - as \"sensible\" but added: \"While a recurrent wealth tax could raise revenue, it would be tough to implement\".\n\n\"It is clear where the Green Party's ambitions lie - a much bigger role for the state, better-funded public services and, of course, a swifter transition to net zero,\" she said.\n\n\"It is unlikely that the specific tax-raising measures they propose to help achieve all this would raise the sorts of sums they claim - and certainly not without real economic cost.\"\n\nElsewhere, Max Wakefield, co-director of climate charity Possible, joined the praise for the Green Party, saying: \"It's great to see a manifesto which acknowledges that we need to be going further and faster on climate, containing a huge raft of policies designed to cut the cost of living while cutting carbon.\n\n\"What this manifesto really gets right is recognising that climate cuts across all areas of our society and our economy, and you can see this embedded in policy from housing, to the economy, to transport, rather than boxed off in its own chapter with vague targets and ambitions.\"\n\nLouise Hutchins, head of policy at the UK Green Building Council, said: \"So far, this election hasn't been a 'climate election' despite the dire warnings from scientists.\n\n\"This manifesto is a useful contribution to driving the issue up the agenda given the next government will be the last capable of bringing in the game-changing policies needed.\"", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It said it would raise up to \u00a380bn from a carbon tax to be set initially at \u00a3120 per tonne of carbon emitted, while adding that it was \"prepared to borrow to invest\" further.\n\n\"Our manifesto is based on investing to mend broken Britain and offer real hope and real change,\" Carla Denyer, co-leader of the party, said at the party's manifesto launch in Brighton on Wednesday.\n\n\"At the heart of this would be a tax on the very richest, the top 1 per cent of people, requiring them to pay a bit more into the pot,\" she said. \"From the Tories and Labour, we've been hearing a race to the bottom on tax.\"\n\nThe party has sought to expand beyond its core policy focus of the environment and climate to become a foil to Labour, stealing away leftwing voters who feel uninspired or unsatisfied with Sir Keir Starmer's position on issues ranging from the conflict in Gaza to taxation and public investment.\n\nThe Labour party ruled out imposing a dedicated wealth tax last year and has also said it has no plans to bring capital gains tax in line with income tax rates. It has also said it will stick to tight fiscal rules on borrowing, including that debt must be falling as a share of GDP by the fifth year of the forecast -- a policy also held by the Conservatives.\n\nIn the seven-way BBC leaders' debate last week, Denyer accused Starmer of having changed Labour \"into the Conservatives\".\n\nThe Greens are targeting four seats at the election on July 4 including Brighton Pavilion, which they already hold, and Bristol Central, where Denyer is in a tight race with shadow culture minister Thangam Debbonaire. They are also targeting Waveney Valley and North Herefordshire.\n\nBut the party faced a setback last week when it was forced to block four candidates from running in the election after a dossier of information was released about allegedly antisemitic comments the individuals had made, shared or liked online.\n\nThe Greens said they would invest \u00a350bn in health and social care to \"defend and restore the NHS\", including a guarantee for an NHS dentist for everyone, and \u00a329bn over the next five years to insulate homes.\n\nThey also set out plans to bring water companies, railways and five retail energy companies into public ownership, and to scrap university tuition fees.\n\nOn housing, the party vowed to create 150,000 new social homes every year by the end of the next parliament and invest \u00a330bn over five years to insulate homes.\n\nIt also said it would stop all new fossil fuel projects and cancel ones that had been licensed recently, including Rosebank in

Election campaign trail on Wednesday", "body": "This evening Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will both face questions as part of a Sky News leaders special.\n\nHere is your guide to the main developments in the General Election campaign on Wednesday:\n\n- A grilling in Grimsby\n\nThis evening Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir will both face questions as part of a Sky News leaders special taking place in Grimsby.\n\nNeither the Prime Minister or the Labour leader will want to flop as they answer questions from journalist Beth Rigby and the studio audience.\n\nPrior to the live broadcast, Mr Sunak is expected to be out campaigning in North East Lincolnshire following the launch of the Tories' manifesto on Tuesday, which proposed to halve immigration and tax cuts totalling \u00a317.2 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Keir will be championing Labour's pledge to spend \u00a3380 million fixing one million potholes every year.\n\nThe leader will visit the North East alongside shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh, who has accused the Tories of failing drivers, adding that Labour is the only party \"truly on the side of drivers\".\n\nUnder the proposals, Labour has promised to fund local authorities to improve the condition of local roads and break down planning barriers to ensure vital upgrades to infrastructure is delivered on time and to budget.\n\nThe pledges will be funded by deferring the A27 bypass, instead spending the \u00a3320 million on repairs across the country.\n\n- So long, farewell Ofwat\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey will be championing the party's plans for a new clean water authority to replace Ofwat as he pays a visit to the West Midlands and the Home Counties.\n\nThe party has promised to \"end the sewage scandal\" by transforming water firms into public benefit companies, banning bonuses for water bosses until discharges and leaks stop, and replacing Ofwat with a new regulator.\n\nThe Green Party will pledge to raise taxes for the wealthiest in society and mend \"broken Britain\" in its election manifesto.\n\nA tax on multimillionaires and billionaires will be used to fund improvements to health, housing, transport and the green economy, the party said.\n\nAhead of the manifesto launch in Brighton and Hove, the party's co-leader Adrian Ramsay said the party intends to change the \"conspiracy of silence\" on taxes by creating a fairer system and asking those \"with the broadest shoulders to pay more\".", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [],

Resist.\"\n\nAnother, Kefentse Dennis in Birmingham Perry Barr, appeared to show support for a pro-Palestine demonstration outside Auschwitz concentration camp.\n\nThe party launched its manifesto in Brighton, where Caroline Lucas was the sole Green MP in the outgoing House of Commons.\n\nSian Berry is seeking to succeed her in the Brighton Pavilion constituency, and the party hopes to at least double its count of MPs with co-leader Carla Denyer standing in the new constituency of Bristol Central against Labour frontbencher Thangam Debbonaire.\n\n\"Now is the time to be ambitious, not unrealistic,\" Ms Denyer said at the launch, insisting the manifesto was \"fully costed\".\n\nShe added: \"We reject an economy based on unfairness and instead embrace a fairer, greener economy.\"",

It's only right that they pay more towards upgrading our homes, infrastructure and public services.\"\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warned the party's manifesto proposals will come with a \"real economic cost\" and increase disincentives to work.\n\nIts deputy director, Helen Miller, described some plans - such as closing loopholes within inheritance tax - as \"sensible\" but added: \"While a recurrent wealth tax could raise revenue, it would be tough to implement\".\n\n\"It is clear where the Green Party's ambitions lie - a much bigger role for the state, better-funded public services and, of course, a swifter transition to net zero,\" she said.\n\n\"It is unlikely that the specific tax-raising measures they propose to help achieve all this would raise the sorts of sums they claim - and certainly not without real economic cost.\"\n\nElsewhere, Max Wakefield, co-director of climate charity Possible, joined the praise for the Green Party, saying: \"It's great to see a manifesto which acknowledges that we need to be going further and faster on climate, containing a huge raft of policies designed to cut the cost of living while cutting carbon.\n\n\"What this manifesto really gets right is recognising that climate cuts across all areas of our society and our economy, and you can see this embedded in policy from housing, to the economy, to transport, rather than boxed off in its own chapter with vague targets and ambitions.\"\n\nLouise Hutchins, head of policy at the UK Green Building Council, said: \"So far, this election hasn't been a 'climate election' despite the dire warnings from scientists.\n\n\"This manifesto is a useful contribution to driving the issue up the agenda given the next government will be the last capable of bringing in the game-changing policies needed.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

manifesto at a glance", "body": "Here are some of the headline policy proposals from the Greens.\n\nThe Green Party have launched their General Election manifesto, with promises to stop \"all new fossil fuel projects\", overhaul the tax system and give \"rights to nature itself\".\n\nHere are some of the headline policy proposals from the Greens.\n\n- The economy\n\nThe Green Party has pledged to raise taxes for the wealthiest in society and mend \"broken Britain\" in its election manifesto.\n\nA tax on multimillionaires and billionaires will be used to raise additional revenue of between \u00a330-70 billion to help fund improvements to health, housing, transport and the green economy, the party said.\n\nIn its manifesto, the Greens also said \"privatisation has failed\" and promised to bring water companies, railways and the five big retail energy companies into state ownership.\n\nOther measures include a pledge to invest \u00a340 billion a year to shift to a green economy, a \u00a312.4 billion investment pledge in green skills and training, and a carbon tax to drive down emissions - all during the next parliament.\n\n- Energy\n\nThe Green Party said it will \"accelerate clean energy investment and delivery\" by cancelling recent oil and gas licences such as those for the Rosebank oil and gas field, removing all oil and gas subsidies and stopping all new fossil fuel extraction projects in the UK.\n\nThe party also said it wants to see \"the phase-out of all nuclear energy\" and will push for wind to provide 70% of UK energy by 2030.\n\n- Nature\n\nOn nature, the party has outlined extensive plans to protect and restore the UK's environment by \"giving rights to nature itself\".\n\nThe party will work to end the sewage scandal, extend people's access to nature with a new English Right to Roam Act, and end the emergency authorisation of bee-killing pesticides.\n\nOn protecting animals and habitats, elected MPs will call for an end to all blood sports, badger culling, factory farming, routine use of antibiotics in farm animals and close confinement in cages.\n\n- Farming\n\nFor more on agriculture, the Greens have pledged to \"work with farmers and other stakeholders to transform our food and farming system\".\n\nTheir manifesto includes measures such as almost tripling financial support for farmers to transition to nature-friendly farming, improving biodiversity and soil health, and linking farm payments to reduced use of pesticides.\n\n- Housing\n\nThe party has vowed to provide \"fairer, greener homes for all\", signalling that it wants to make the UK's housing crisis one of its key priorities for the next Parliament.\n\nUnder their plans, housebuilders would have to include solar panels and heat pumps on all new homes where appropriate and \u00a333 billion would be invested in insulating homes and other buildings over the next five years.\n\nThe party also promised to provide 150,000 new social homes every year and a \"fair deal for renters\" by giving powers to local authorities to introduce rent control measures.\n\n- Health and social care\n\nOn health, the Greens said they want to ensure a \"fully public, properly funded health and social care system\", promising to spend \u00a350 billion per year by 2030.\n\nThe manifesto said elected MPs will push for a year-on-year reduction in waiting lists, guaranteed access to an NHS dentist, guaranteed rapid access to a GP, and an immediate boost to the pay of NHS staff.\n\nOther areas the party will focus on include increasing funding for mental health care and support a change in the law to legalise assisted dying for those with terminal diseases.\n\nOn social care, the party has pledged to introduce free personal care, increase carer pay rates and introduce a career structure for the sector.\n\n- Workers' rights\n\nIn the manifesto, the party said it plans to \"defend and extend workers' rights\" as it outlined measures such as repealing \"anti-union\" legislation and introducing a maximum 10:1 pay ratio.\n\nThe party will also push to increase the minimum wage to \u00a315 an hour no matter the age - up from its current rate of \u00a311.44 an hour for those aged 21 or over - and will move to introduce a four-day working week.\n\n- Welfare\n\nIn the manifesto's section on social support, the party pledges to \"tackle the cost-of-living crisis for the poorest in our society\".\n\nMeasures include increasing Universal Credit and legacy benefits by \u00a340 a week, abolishing the two-child benefit cap, introducing a universal basic income and giving disability benefits an immediate 5% uplift.\n\n- Transport\n\nThe Greens' plans to cut carbon emissions include championing \"better, cheaper public transport\" by increasing annual public subsidies for rail and bus travel to \u00a310bn and investing an additional \u00a319 billion to improve public transport by the end of the next Parliament.\n\nOther measures include a focus on active travel, with the party pledging to invest \u00a32.5bn a year in new cycleways and footpaths, and reducing traffic in residential areas to boost community use.\n\nOn aviation, elected MPs will push for a frequent-flyer levy, a ban on domestic flights for journeys that would take less than three hours by train and a halt to the expansion of new airport capacity.\n\n- Education\n\nThe Greens said the current education system \"operates like a production line rather than valuing their individual qualities\".\n\nThe manifesto said elected MPs will champion an increase in school funding of \u00a38 billion, ending tuition fees for higher education students, stopping high-stakes testing at schools and abolishing Ofsted.\n\n- Arts and culture\n\nGreen MPs will push for a \u00a35 billion investment to support community sports, arts and culture, the manifesto said.\n\nThe party also backs efforts to keep local sports facilities, museums, theatres, libraries and art galleries open and thriving as well as ending VAT on cultural activities.\n\n- Media reform\n\nThe manifesto said the current media landscape is \"skewed by the dominance of billionaire and big-tech ownership\" with the aim of maximising profits.\n\nThe party said it will push for a change in the law so that no single individual or company can own more than 20% of any media market and introduce all reforms proposed in the second part of the 2012 Leveson Report.\n\n- Foreign policy\n\nThe Green Party said it will seek to rejoin the European Union \"as soon as the political conditions are right\" as it unveiled its foreign policy objectives.\n\nIn the manifesto, the party said UK foreign policy \"should be based on shared commitments to democracy, peace, global solidarity and the protection of human rights\" as it pledged continued support for Ukraine against the Russian invasion.\n\nOn Israel and Palestine, the party said it will push for an immediate bilateral ceasefire as well as a \"durable political solution\".\n\nOn nuclear weapons, the party said it would see the UK begin the process of dismantling its nuclear weapons, cancel the Trident programme and remove all foreign nuclear weapons from UK soil.\n\nAnd on supporting Global South countries to tackle the climate crisis, the Greens back an increase to international aid to 1% of gross national income (GNI) and an increase to climate finance to 1.5% by 2033.\n\n- Rights and freedoms\n\nThe manifesto said the party will \"defend the Human Rights Act, the UK's membership of the European Convention on Human Rights and continued direct access to convention rights in the domestic courts\".\n\nOn political reform, the party will replace the first past the post system for parliamentary elections with a fair and proportional voting system, replace the House of Lords with an elected second chamber and provide votes for 16-year-olds.\n\nThe party said it will also campaign to end violence against women and girls, scrap legislation that erodes the right to protest and free expression, and campaign for the right of self-identification for trans and non-binary people.\n\nOther headline pledges including working to renew England's crumbling court system with a \u00a32.5bn investment and giving Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the choice to make their \"own decisions about their relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom\".\n\n- Immigration\n\nIn its manifesto, the Green Party said it welcomes \"the contributions that migrants and refugees make to British society\" and would support safe routes to sanctuary for those fleeing persecution.\n\nThe party also said it will replace a \"dysfunctional Home Office\" with a new Department of Migration, end immigration detention, and allow asylum seekers to work while their applications are decided.", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

To be clear about the kind of country we want to live in. About how broken our public services are and the action that's needed to fix them.\"\n\nAt the heart of the manifesto is the Party's vision for a \"fairer, greener tax system\", which sets out a raft of reforms aimed at raising tens of billions of pounds more a year to spend on the NHS, improved public services, and a nationwide home insulation drive.\n\nThese include plans for a new carbon tax on all businesses, starting at \u00a3120 a tonne and rising to \u00a3500 a tonne over 10 years. The tax would initially align existing fossil fuel taxes such as fuel duty, the Climate Change Levy, and payments under the UK's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), and could raise up to \u00a380bn a year, according to the manifesto.\n\nThe Party said it would not impose any further increases in the main rates of corporation tax, but it would \"initially\" maintain the current windfall tax on the profits of energy and oil and gas firms, in addition to introducing a new levy on banks following significant interest rate rises in recent years. Such moves could raise another \u00a39bn, it claimed.\n\nIt also proposes a raft of personal tax reforms it claims could raise between \u00a350bn and \u00a370bn a year for the Treasury. These include a new one per cent wealth tax on all assets worth more than \u00a310m, increasing to two per cent on assets above \u00a31bn, in addition to increases in capital gains tax, and an uptick in the National Insurance rate to eight per cent for those earning more than \u00a350,270 a year.\n\nThe revenue gained from new taxes on polluters and wealthiest households combined with borrowing would enable a \"game-changing\" transformation of the UK's health, housing, transport, and green infrastructure, the Party said.\n\nHeadline spending plans in the manifesto include an extra \u00a350bn a year on health and social care by 2030, and \u00a320bn in capital investment to bring \"crumbling\" hospitals, primary care buildings and equipment up to scratch.\n\nCrucially, the manifesto outlines plans to invest \u00a340bn a year in support of the shift to a greener economy, with \u00a312.4bn set aside for green skills training and \u00a32bn to for councils to help local businesses decarbonise.\n\nIt also sets out plans to spend \u00a329bn over the next five years to insulate homes nationwide up to a minimum Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) band B for energy efficiency, as well as provide \u00a34bn to insulate commercial and public buildings, and \u00a39bn to support the rollout of low carbon heating systems such as heat pumps.\n\nOn energy, the Greens are targeting 70 per cent of UK power supply from offshore and onshore wind by 2030, with goals to ramp up offshore wind capacity to 80GW, onshore wind to 53GW and solar to 100GW by as soon as 2035, all backed by further investment in energy storage capacity, according to the manifesto.\n\nOther clean energy policies include encouraging community ownership in local clean energy infrastructure such as wind farms backed by greater access to government funding.\n\nHowever, in stark contrast to Labour and the Conservatives, the Greens said they wanted to see a phase-out of nuclear energy in the UK, which they argue is unsafe, too slow to develop, and \"much more expensive than renewables\".\n\nAt the same time, the Party pledged to cancel all recent licenses for new oil and gas drilling in UK waters - including the controversial Rosebank project in the North Sea - while banning all new fossil fuel extraction projects and removing all subsidies for the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe manifesto also proposes a carbon tax on all fossil fuel imports and domestic extraction, based on greenhouse gas emissions produced when the fuel is burned, the manifesto states.\n\nProposed investments in transport include \u00a319bn for improving public transport and \u00a32.5bn a year for new cycleways and footpaths over the next five years, in addition to increasing public subsidies for rail and bus travel to \u00a310bn by the end of the next Parliament and offering free bus travel for under-18s.\n\nThe Party would also give local authorities more control over funding for improve bus services, back schemes to reduce traffic in residential areas, and adopt a target for half of all trips in England's towns and cities to be undertaken by foot or bike by 2030, according to the manifesto.\n\nThe Greens would seek to implement a frequent flyer levy on those traveling frequently by plane - a proposal explicitly rules out by the Conservatives in their manifesto yesterday - as well as introduce a ban on domestic flights for journeys that would take less than three hours by train and a moratorium on the expansion of new airport capacity across the country.\n\nNature pledges include introducing a new Rights of Nature Act, extending public rights to access green space with a new Right to Roam Act, and bringing in a new \"Clean Air (Human Rights) Act\". It also promises to ban bee-killing pesticides and deliver the UK's commitment to protect 30 per cent of land and seas by 2030.\n\nFinancial support for farmers to support nature-friendly agriculture would also be tripled, the Party said.\n\nElsewhere, the manifesto emphasises the Greens' commitment to the UK's international climate obligations, while promising to increase climate finance for the Global South to 1.5 per cent of Britain's gross national income by 2033 and provide further funding to the new international Loss and Damage Fund that is scheduled to become operational in the coming year.\n\nApeaking at the launch event this morning, Green Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay said there was a need to \"be bold and ambitious\" to invest in boosting Britain's economy and stressed that \"protecting our climate and nature lies at the heart of our policies\".\n\nThe Greens are fielding record numbers of candidates in next month's General Election, with hopes of potentially returning four or more MPs to Parliament, despite the Party's current sole MP Caroline Lucas stepping down.\n\n\"With more Green MPs in Parliament, we will stop Labour backtracking on any more of their promises,\" said Ramsay. \"We will push them to be braver, to be more ambitious, and to actually do what's necessary to fix our broken country and get us back on track.\"\n\nYou can now sign up to

as well as a plan to reach net zero goals 10 years before their rivals.\n\nThe Green Party says it wants to \"mend broken Britain\" through a programme of investment paid for by the \"very richest\" in society.\n\nSpeaking at their launch in East Sussex, co-leader Carla Denyer said their suggested \"overhaul\" of the tax system would see \"billions go into the country's collective pocket to pay for the future of our public services\", including the NHS, schools and social care.\n\nHer fellow leader, Adrian Ramsay, said the party was \"realistic\" that they won't form the next government.\n\nBut he said after the election on 4 July, \"we plan to be that in parliament in greater numbers to speak up for you on the issues you care about, like a revitalised NHS, bold action on the climate and a fair economy\".\n\nPolitics live: Greens launch manifesto with vow to target 'super rich'\n\nIn its 45-page manifesto, the party offered a raft of policies, with many being covered by the top 1% of earners having to \"pay a bit more into the pot\".\n\nThis would include a 1% annual wealth tax on assets above \u00a310m and 2% on assets above \u00a31bn, along with reforms to Capital Gains Tax to align with workers' income tax, and removing the upper earnings limit on national insurance.\n\nRead more:\n\nA guide to the Green Party\n\nFive questions leaders could face in tonight's Sky News event\n\nThe Greens believe this could raise up to \u00a370bn a year, with their plans to introduce a carbon tax adding another \u00a380bn to the government's coffers.\n\nBut unlike some of their rivals, the party also said they were \"prepared to borrow to invest\", rather than be \"trapped by a self-imposed fiscal straitjacket\".\n\nWhen it comes to the NHS, the manifesto says in bold that they are committed to a \"fully public, properly funded health and social care system\" with an investment of \u00a350bn.\n\nBut more specifically, the party will push for a year-on-year reduction in waiting lists, guaranteed access to NHS dentists, guaranteed rapid access to a GP - on the same day if urgent - and an immediate boost to the pay of NHS staff, including the restorative pay junior doctors are striking for, as well hospital building and repairs over the next five years.\n\nOn social care, the Greens want to see a \u00a320bn investment for free personal care, to increase pay rates for staff and introduce a new \"career structure\" for cares to \"rebuild the care workforce\", alongside an additional \u00a33bn for children's social care specifically.\n\nTheir housing policies include launching a new charter to make local authorities spread small housing developments across an area, and the pledge to build 150,000 new social homes each year by the end of the next parliament - as well as ending the \"right to buy\" scheme that takes those houses out of circulation.\n\nNew homes would have to meet energy efficiency standards, including installing heat pumps and solar panels \"where appropriate\", and the party would push for a street-by-street retrofit scheme to insulate homes.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_scott@news.sky.com", "name": "Jennifer Scott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_England_and_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carla_Denyer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carla Denyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Ramsay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Ramsay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_ownership", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State ownership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Sussex", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Sussex"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Sussex"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital gains tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wealth tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://e3.365dm.com/24/06/768x432/skynews-green-party-launch_6579553.jpg?20240612115051", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644534", "eventUri": "eng-9644534", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 711, "textEnd": 717}], "sentiment": 0.5686274509803921, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

the studio audience.\n\nPrior to the live broadcast, Mr Sunak is expected to be out campaigning in North East Lincolnshire following the launch of the Tories' manifesto on Tuesday, which proposed to halve immigration and tax cuts totalling \u00a317.2 billion.\n\n- Potholes, be gone\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Keir will be championing Labour's pledge to spend \u00a3380 million fixing one million potholes every year.\n\nThe leader will visit the North East alongside shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh, who has accused the Tories of failing drivers, adding that Labour is the only party \"truly on the side of drivers\".\n\nUnder the proposals, Labour has promised to fund local authorities to improve the condition of local roads and break down planning barriers to ensure vital upgrades to infrastructure is delivered on time and to budget.\n\nThe party has also committed to tackle soaring car insurance costs by calling in regulators to crack down on the causes of soaring costs.\n\nThe pledges will be funded by deferring the A27 bypass, instead spending the \u00a3320 million on repairs across the country.\n\n- So long, farewell Ofwat\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey will be championing the party's plans for a new clean water authority to replace Ofwat as he pays a visit to the West Midlands and the Home Counties.\n\nThe party has promised to \"end the sewage scandal\" by transforming water firms into public benefit companies, banning bonuses for water bosses until discharges and leaks stop, and replacing Ofwat with a new regulator.\n\n- Greens hit the wealthy with taxes\n\nThe Green Party will pledge to raise taxes for the wealthiest in society and mend \"broken Britain\" in its election manifesto.\n\nA tax on multimillionaires and billionaires will be used to fund improvements to health, housing, transport and the green economy, the party said.\n\nAhead of the manifesto launch in Brighton and Hove, the party's co-leader Adrian Ramsay said the party intends to change the \"conspiracy of silence\" on taxes by creating a fairer system and asking those \"with the broadest shoulders to pay more\".", "source": {"uri": "clactonandfrintongazette.co.uk",

The Conservatives, for comparison, have only committed to increasing spending in line with inflation.\n\nThe massive tax boost would enable \"a year-on-year reduction in waiting lists\" - currently at record levels - and guarantee access to an NHS dentist.\n\nThe system-wide salary increases include a 35% pay increase for junior doctors.\n\nThe party would also legislate for free personal care, modeled on that available in Scotland, and dedicate an extra \u00a33 billion to local authorities for children's social care.\n\nThe Greens have pledged to build 150,000 new genuinely affordable social homes each year and end the Right to Buy scheme.\n\nThe party would launch a massive \u00a348 billion renovation campaign, insulating homes and installing heat pumps. Denyer admitted the program was expensive, but said it would ultimately reduce energy bills.\n\n\"Warm, secure and affordable housing is something that millions of people in this country do not have,\" she added. \"[It is an] important, a basic element for a happy and successful life.\n\nOther plans include rent control and an end to no-fault evictions.\n\nThe Social Market Foundation welcomed this project as a step in the right direction.\n\n\"We welcome the Greens' plan for social housing which promises both more development of social housing and the maintenance of existing social housing stock by ending Help to Buy, as outlined in previous SMF research,\" said researcher Niamh O Regan.\n\n\"Their target to build 150,000 social homes would mean doubling current social housing construction - it's ambitious, but with social housing as the main objective of housing policy, it's possible. They do not, however, describe how this would be financed. past work of SMF suggested that fairness taxes could provide \u00a34 billion of funding each year for social housing.\"\n\nThe Greens would renationalise water and rail. It would also bring the big five retail energy companies into public ownership.\n\nLabor has pledged to renationalise the railways, clawing back private contracts as they expire. However, the party reversed its plan to nationalize water. Privatized water companies paid around \u00a3377 to shareholders for every hour polluted last year.\n\nThe Green Party would ban all new fossil fuel projects and cancel those recently licensed, such as Rosebank.\n\nFunding for renewable energy would come from a carbon tax, a levy on activities that lead to CO2 emissions. The party wants 70% of Britain's electricity to come from wind by 2030.\n\n\"A secure energy supply and action on the climate crisis go hand in hand,\" Ramsay said. They want to reach net zero \"years ahead\" of the current schedule.\n\nMike Childs, head of policy at Friends of the Earth, said urgency was needed.\n\n\"The Green Party is so far the only political party that has understood the reality that unless we invest properly in reducing carbon emissions from our homes, our industries, our agriculture and our transport, it will be impossible to avoid the enormous financial and human costs of the climate change crisis in the future,\" he said.\n\n\"Money spent on green growth allows us to permanently reduce energy bills, create long-term jobs in clean industries and stimulate the economy. \"\n\nBig Issue demands an end to poverty in this general election. Will you sign our open letter to party leaders?\n\nThe Greens say they would \"fully fund\" every student and reinstate maintenance grants, at a projected annual cost of \u00a37.8 billion. The party would also wipe out the outstanding loans of every student who has attended a university in England since tuition fees reached \u00a39,000 per student in 2012.\n\nOther education reforms include scrapping Ofsted and \"ending high-stakes testing\" in schools.\n\nThe party wants to increase the minimum wage to \u00a315 an hour. They would also implement a 10:1 pay ratio that would limit CEO compensation to 10 times the level of the lowest-paid worker.

It includes a raft of policies to tackle the issues facing public services, housing, and the climate.\n\nGreen candidate Sian Berry is hoping to succeed Caroline Lucas in Brighton Pavilion. She said \"the time for half measures and empty promises is over\". Keir Starmer, meanwhile, has offered many empty promises - U-turning on every pledge he made to become Labour leader.\n\nGreen Party manifesto policies on housing include the provision of 150,000 social homes per year. This is through new builds and the purchase or refurbishment of existing housing stock.\n\nThe manifesto also floats rent controls. Such an approach is highly necessary as people are spending close to 40% of average incomes on rent. That's essentially free money for landlords simply because they already had the money to buy more accommodation and treat what they don't live in like assets.\n\nAs part of a 'Green Economic Transformation', the party pledges a \u00a340bn investment per year in transitioning to a green economy. The Greens would also bring the big five energy companies into public ownership and issue a carbon tax to disincentivise fossil fuel use.\n\nOn education, Green Party MPs would push for an increase in school funding of \u00a38bn. That includes \u00a32bn going to a pay rise for teachers. The party would end tuition fees. This would prevent young people from being saddled with debt for trying to learn and enrich their lives.\n\nWhen it comes to Israel's ongoing genocide against Palestinian people, the Greens state they would support the International Court of Justice (ICJ) investigation into Israel's \"plausible\" genocide. This is in contrast to Labour, where Keir Starmer mostly ignores the ICJ and shadow health secretary Wes Streeting called it a \"distraction\".\n\nThe Greens said they would restore funding to the UNRWA, which is a life-line for Palestinian people, and support \"an urgent international effort to end the illegal occupation of Palestinian land\". The party would also end arms sales to Israel.\n\nWe need to oppose the establishment managers in both Labour and Tory this election.

So people who fly on holiday once a year would not be charged extra, because we're talking about frequent fliers, and actually just 15 per cent of the population take 70 per cent of the flights.\n\n\"So we're talking about business people or people who have wealth and fly frequently.\"\n\nHe said the Greens \"haven't set out a specific proposal for exactly how it would work\", but pointed to the NEF model as one example.\n\nHe added: \"The key here is the word frequent... the people who are flying all the time, not the ordinary family that's having one or two holidays a year\".\n\nMeanwhile, the Green Party said that it would invest heavily in public transport to make it easier and cheaper for people to go on holiday in Britain.\n\nTheir plans include bringing the railways back into public ownership, introducing free bus travel for under-18s and investing \u00a32.5 billion a year in new cycleways and footpaths.\n\nThe party would also ban all domestic flights where the journey would take less than three hours by train and halt the expansion of new airport capacity.\n\nAsked if he would ultimately like to see domestic flights scrapped completely, Mr Ramsay said: \"We've proposed our vision for the next five years, which is all you can do when there's a general election, to say what you think is achievable in the next parliament.\n\n\"But aviation has a high carbon impact, particularly from those who are frequent fliers, who are 15 per cent of people taking 70 per cent of the flights. We need to find a way of addressing that in a way that recognises the environmentally friendly option needs to be the cheapest and most convenient.\"\n\nTo fund its spending plans, the Green Party pledged to introduce a new wealth tax of 1 per cent on assets above \u00a310 million and of 2 per cent on those above \u00a31 billion.\n\nIt would also hike taxes for middle earners by raising the national insurance rate on annual wages of \u00a350,270 and above from 2 per cent to 8 per cent.\n\nThe Greens said this would amount to a \"modest\" \u00a35 tax rise per week for those earning \u00a355,000, or around \u00a3260 per year.\n\nThe party said these changes, together with reforms to capital gains tax and the rates paid on investment income, would raise between \u00a350 billion and \u00a370 billion per year.\n\nCarbon tax\n\nA new carbon tax would raise up to an additional \u00a380 billion, according to the manifesto.\n\nSpeaking at the manifesto launch at Sussex County Cricket Club in Hove, Mr Ramsay said the party was \"realistic\" that it does \"not expect to form the next government\".\n\nBut he said \"we plan to be there in Parliament in greater numbers\" to hold Labour to account \"when the Conservatives are booted out of No 10 on July 4\".\n\nHe added: \"With more Green MPs in Parliament, we will push Labour to stop backtracking on their promises.\n\n\"We will be there to drive them to be braver, to be more ambitious, not to take timid baby steps towards change but to actually do what's necessary to fix our country and get us back on track.\"\n\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated that the plans would see the size of the state increase on \"an unprecedented scale\", with taxes rising by \u00a3170 billion per year.\n\nHelen Miller, the deputy director at the think tank, said: \"Even taking their figures at face value, overall borrowing would end up around \u00a380 billion a year higher and we could expect debt to be rising throughout the next Parliament.\"\n\nMs Miller also said that it was \"unlikely\" that the party's proposed tax rises would generate the amount claimed and \"certainly not without real economic cost\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_gibbons@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Amy Gibbons", "type": "author",

Our best hope lies with the Green party | George Monbiot", "body": "The party's manifesto, which pledges to use a wealth tax to revitalise our public services, shows it can push Labour to raise its ambitions\n\nAll governments betray the hopes of their supporters. But Labour is getting its betrayal in early. By ruling out a wealth tax and other measures that could fund our collapsing public services and our increasingly desperate care and welfare needs; by failing to denounce the unfolding genocide in Gaza; by remaining silent about the curtailment of our rights to protest; by breaking its promises on everything from a national care service to the abolition of the House of Lords and a right to roam, Keir Starmer's party appears to wear betrayal as a badge of honour. This country is desperate for change, but while Starmer mumbles the word in every sentence, he offers as little as he can get away with.\n\nWhy? Labour's anticipatory betrayal is motivated by anticipatory compliance. This means avoiding conflict with billionaire-owned media, the financial, property and fossil fuel sectors, by giving them what they want before they ask. You could call this approach \"political realism\". But the \"realistic\" result is a politics dominated by the sinister rich. Dysfunction and misrule are baked in.\n\nSo, whatever the size of Labour's likely majority, we will need countervailing forces in parliament. Though I have never been a member of any party, I believe our best hope lies with the Green party. It is the only one that has a chance of winning seats in this election that is not beholden to oligarchic power. Its new manifesto offers us everything a genuine Labour party, fit for the 21st century, should be promising.\n\nThe Greens propose immediately to bring the railways, water companies and the \"big five\" energy companies back into public ownership. They would guarantee access to an NHS dentist for everyone. They would greatly increase NHS funding, to reduce waiting times, build hospitals, improve primary care and restore pay levels for junior doctors and other staff. They would also greatly expand the provision of mental healthcare, and ensure that children and adolescents no longer need to wait years for an assessment. They'd ensure that all elderly people and people with disabilities have access to free personal care.\n\nThey want to address the shocking failures of the welfare state, increasing universal credit by \u00a340 a week, restoring the value of disability benefits, abolishing the iniquitous two-child benefit cap and scrapping the bedroom tax. They seek to end tuition fees and bring back grants for higher education, pour an extra \u00a38bn of investment into schools and \u00a35bn for special needs provision within mainstream education. They would increase public subsidies for rail and bus transport by \u00a310bn a year.\n\nThey also intend to repeal anti-union legislation and introduce a charter of workers' rights, to press for a maximum pay ratio within any organisation of 10:1, and to ensure all workers have full employment rights and protections. How did we end up with a situation in which none of this is Labour policy?\n\nThe Green party would also radically reform the housing sector, providing 150,000 new social homes a year, ensuring that social homes can no longer be sold off, and enabling local authorities to introduce rent controls. It would invest \u00a329bn over five years to insulate and improve housing, and give tenants the right to demand energy efficiency improvements from their landlords.\n\nThe Green manifesto proposes replacing the House of Lords with an elected chamber, introducing a fairer voting and party funding system, restoring the right to protest, ensuring no one can own more than 20% of the media and introducing a digital bill of rights to regulate social media providers.\n\nMost importantly, the Greens would confront the greatest predicament humankind has ever faced, by transforming our relationship with the natural world. This would include ending all new and recent oil and gas licences, introducing an escalating carbon tax and ensuring 70% of electricity comes from wind by 2030. Manufacturers of household white goods would have to offer 10-year warranties, there would be a comprehensive right to repair, and new green duties on all company directors. A right to roam would be accompanied by large-scale ecological protections, on land and at sea.\n\nAll this and more would be funded with a combination of a wealth tax, set at 1% a year for those with assets worth over \u00a310m, and 2% for those with assets above \u00a31bn; a reformed capital gains tax, bringing it into line with income tax levels; much fairer taxation of homes and property; and higher windfall taxes on oil and gas production, and on banks when excessive profits are made. It's everything the Labour party should be doing, in other words, but is too frightened to propose. No one expects the Greens to form the new government but we need them to hold Labour to account and press it to raise its level of ambition.\n\nThe Green party has a good chance of winning two seats in this election - Brighton Pavilion, where former party leader Caroline Lucas is standing down, and Bristol Central - and a smaller chance of winning a further two, Waveney Valley and North Herefordshire. If you live in one of these constituencies and wish to evict the Tories, this is the most effective way to use your vote. That's because, unlike most of us, you have a realistic chance of electing an MP who can speak for the people against plutocratic power. Don't waste it.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_monbiot@theguardian.com", "name": "George Monbiot", "type": "author",

Co-leader Adrian Ramsay said Green MPs would push Labour to \"stop backtracking on their promises\".\n\nOther measures in the document include an end to the controversial two-child benefit cap, an increase in Universal Credit by \u00a340 a week and the removal of oil and gas subsidies.\n\nMr Ramsay said of Labour: \"We will be there to drive them to be braver, to be more ambitious, not to take timid baby steps towards change but to actually do what's necessary to fix our country and get us back on track.\"\n\nFellow co-leader Carla Denyer said her party would \"overhaul our tax system to make it fairer\". She added: \"At the heart of this would be a tax on the very richest, the top 1% of people requiring them to pay a bit more into the pot.

They want to:\n\nPush for UK to sign UN Treaty on Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons Once this is done, dismantle nuclear weapons Green energy\n\nAs you'd expect, this is central to the Greens' pledges. Among the key promises in the manifesto are:\n\nPush for wind to provide around 70% of UK's electricity by 2030 Cancel recent fossil fuel licences and stop all new fossil fuel extraction projects in the UK Remove all oil and gas subsidies Introduce a carbon tax on all fossil fuel imports and domestic extraction Workers' rights\n\nThe Greens have proposed an overhaul of workers' rights.

The party's realistic hope seems to be to double its number of Commons seats, from one to two. Nevertheless, the Greens do have a full manifesto for government, so let's do it justice by taking it seriously.\n\nMercifully, the Greens seem to have not bought into the fashionable concept of 'degrowth' (i.e., permanent recession). In fact, there is a rash of spending promises that seem to rely on a rapidly-growing economy. The Greens want to spend an extra \u00a350 billion a year on health and social care, \u00a320 billion of it to fund free personal care. They want to spend \u00a340 billion a year shifting to a green economy. It doesn't say whether this includes the \u00a329 billion it would like to spend over the next five years to insulate all homes to at least a 'B' rating on an Energy Performance Certificate.\n\nIt doesn't say who will qualify for this dosh, but if anyone thinks that \u00a329 billion would come anywhere close to insulating all existing homes to a 'B' rating, they can think again. With 28 million households in Britain, that works out at just over \u00a31,000 per household. Yet to fit insulation to the 8 million homes or so with solid walls will typically cost between \u00a37,500 and \u00a312,000 for a three-bedroom house (according to the government's energy efficiency quango, the Energy Saving Trust). Moreover, that is just one element which on its own will not bring old houses anywhere close to a 'B' rating on an EPC. Fitting a heat pump will cost at least a further \u00a310,000.\n\nWhere would the money come from to fund the Greens' spending pledges? I am sure it is only a desire to save paper that has prevented the party from providing a full costings document, but from what I can glean, this is the plan. There would be a carbon tax levied at \u00a3120 per tonne of carbon emitted, rising to \u00a3500 per tonne over ten years, raising \u00a380 billion. A further \u00a350-\u00a370 billion would be raised on a series of changes to personal taxation. The upper limit on earnings would be removed so that National Insurance would be levied on all income - meaning the effective upper rate of income tax for employees would rise from 47 percent now (45 percent plus 2 percent NI) to 57 percent (45 percent plus 8 percent). Tax rates for investment income would rise to the same level as those for earned incomes - in other words, we would be paying up to 57 percent on investment earnings, too. Capital Gains Tax would be raised to the same rate, and on top of that, there would be a wealth tax of 1 percent on any wealth above \u00a310 million and 2 percent on any wealth above \u00a31 billion.\n\nBut here is where it starts to fall apart. The Greens helpfully remind us that their wealth tax would only be paid by a 'tiny number' of people. It claims there are 171 billionaires in Britain at present. But then that could well fall to zero if the Greens got into power. Elsewhere in its manifesto, the party tells us that it would introduce a maximum ratio of 10:1 for the highest-paid individual in an organisation (public or private) to the lowest-paid. This would effectively impose a maximum salary of around \u00a3300,000 in most companies (unless they outsourced all the low-paid work). The question then is how much revenue would a Green government really be raising from its tax rises on high earners? Given that the richest 1 per cent of the population currently pays a little under a third of all income tax, you can see the problem. But there is little to suggest this issue has been addressed. There is a similar problem with the planned carbon tax. If it really does 'drive fossil fuels out of our economy', as the Greens say they want, then it will end up raising no revenue at all. Forget the extra \u00a380 billion - it would erode revenue from existing carbon levies and fuel duty.\n\nAs to what Green policies would do for our fuel bills, that is another matter. The party says it wants 70 percent of our electricity to come from wind power by 2030. At the same time, it says it wants to phase out nuclear power. How, then, to keep the lights on when the wind isn't blowing? No solution is offered.\n\nThe Greens will no doubt scoop up votes from people who feel good about voting Green. But as far as a realistic programme for government is concerned, they don't have one.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_clark@spectator.us", "name": "Ross Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_90/The_Greens", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Greens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Ramsay", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Ramsay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrowth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Degrowth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Saving_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy Saving Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_insulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Building insulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_insulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermal insulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quango", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quango"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wealth tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital gains tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/PolColGreensWeb.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644534", "eventUri": "eng-9644534", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 200, "textEnd": 206}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

(Getty)\n\nThe Green Party's 2024 election manifesto is finally here and with it, several pledges of interest to the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nThe left-wing environmental party's manifesto was published on Wednesday (12 June) following the arrival of manifestos from the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives earlier in the week.\n\nIn its newly updated manifesto, the Greens pledge to increase taxes for higher earners, safeguard the NHS, introduce rent controls, and much more.\n\n\"We reject the pessimism of the other parties who don't believe we can safeguard our publicly funded health system, [who think] that we can't provide warm and secure homes for everyone, that tackling the climate crisis is too challenging for us,\" the party's co-leader, Adrian Ramsay, said to The Guardian.\n\n\"This manifesto isn't more of the same, it's a look at what things could be like - and soon, if we're willing to invest at the rate necessary and to be bold and ambitious.\"\n\nThe manifesto also makes several promises directed towards the LGBTQ+ community, including a pledge to \"meet the needs\" of the community and other marginalised groups.\n\nThe Green Party manifesto comes in three separate formats - an easy read version, a short version, and a long version.\n\nIn a joint foreword, party co-leaders Adrian Ramsay and Carla Denyer - an out bisexual woman - write that voters in the UK \"are feeling insecure\" and are \"deeply worried about the future.\"\n\n\"We live in one of the richest countries on the planet,\" they write. \"Yet nurses are using food banks, our children's schools are crumbling, a roof over our heads is all too often unaffordable, and hospital and dentist appointments are like gold dust.\n\n\"Our promise to you is that all this can change. We can create a greener, fairer country together.\"\n\nIts first major pledge comes under its section on mental health and neurodiversity, in which it promises to provide a \"readily available tailored provision\" for the LGBTQ+ community, children and adolescents, older people, and communities of colour.\n\nIt also pledges to retain a \"full, evidence-based and age-appropriate\" sex education curriculum which will include discussion of LGBTQ+ people and trans people.\n\nUnder its section on defending human rights, the Green Party writes that it unequivocally supports self-ID - the act of changing a gender marker without the need for surgeries or a medical diagnosis.\n\nCurrently in the UK, trans people are forced to undergo a medical diagnosis for gender dysphoria before they are allowed to change their gender on legal documents, while non-binary people are not recognised at all.\n\nThe Green Party promises in its manifesto that it would formally recognise non-binary and intersex people on legal documents through an X gender marker.\n\nThe spousal veto, which forces trans people to seek permission from their spouse to change their legal gender, would also be scrapped under the Green Party's leadership.\n\nThe Green Party's main pledge for healthcare is to minimise NHS waiting lists through an \u00a38 billion reform paid for through increased taxes for higher earners.\n\nThe aim will be to reduce the administrative burden on GPs to give them more time for face to face appointments with patients and allowing hospital referrals more easily.\n\nAs well as this, it has also pledged to end new cases of HIV by 2030 by using a \"joined-up approach\" that includes easy access to HIV prevention pills online, in pharmacies, and from GPs.\n\n\"We will renew successful opt-out HIV testing programmes in A&Es in all areas with a high prevalence of HIV,\" it continues.\n\nVarious other smaller pledges the Green Party makes that could affect LGBTQ+ people include various human rights pledges, such as advocating for campaigns to minimise hate crimes, particularly against women and girls.\n\nIt also promises to implement equal employment rights for all workers alongside its move to a four-day working week and a move to minimise pay gaps.\n\n\"The Green Party has been going from strength to strength,\" it finishes by writing. \"When we tell the truth, aim high and offer hope, voters respond.\n\n\"Now it's over to you.

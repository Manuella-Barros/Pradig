In the new episode of our weekly Rolling Stone Music Now podcast, Van Zandt looks back on it all, accompanied by Teck.

Van Zandt\u2019s dramatic recent weight loss was all about belatedly re-embracing his rock-star status. \u201cIt was a long journey, mentally, maybe spiritually back to that place,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause once I became an actor, that dominated up until a year ago. I had done the rock star thing, now I\u2019m moving on. So then Bruce puts the band back together [in 1999], and I come back halfway, and stayed there really up until literally two years ago\u2026. We were going to come back and it\u2019s going to be seven years after our previous tour, right? And I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018This could be the last tour. I\u2019m going to be a rock star one more time.\u2019\u2026. And I really feel like, let\u2019s surprise everybody because they\u2019re not going to know what to expect, man\u2026 Is it going to be like a bunch of old men coming back and going through the motions? And I\u2019m like, no way, man. I\u2019m like, we\u2019re going to come back and blow minds\u2026. We\u2019re closer to the end than we are to the beginning, but we ain\u2019t going out quietly, baby. So I lost a hundred pounds in six months. Let\u2019s honor our audience\u2019s loyalty. Let\u2019s honor Bruce Springsteen\u2019s incredible writing and the E Street Bands\u2019 hard work by showing respect and getting in shape for this one.\u201d Van Zandt is deeply proud that he was forward-looking enough to make sure rappers (including Run-DMC, Melle Mel, the Fat Boys, and Kurtis Blow) were part of \u201cSun City\u201d in 1985. \u201cYeah, that was big because the industry was trying to stuff it out in its infancy,\u201d Van Zandt says. People don\u2019t realize that now. They\u2019d probably deny it if you ask them, but I was questioned at the time. \u2018You\u2019re putting Melle Mel next to Jackson Browne, next to Bob Dylan?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yeah! I feel that strongly about this new thing called rap.\u2019 I thought it was monumentally important and and we were happy to to be ahead of the curve that way \u2014 and got them all on MTV on top of that, which was miraculous.\u201d After losing money on two recent tours with his revived Disciples of Soul, Van Zandt doesn\u2019t see his solo career resuming. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he says. \u201cNot unless I win the lottery. I\u2019m still paying for those two! And I just felt I needed to do it. It\u2019s very expensive. And unless I get to find a patron at some point, it\u2019s unlikely that\u2019ll ever happen again. I gotta say, it\u2019s almost impossible.\u201d Van Zandt was in a dark place after leaving the E Street Band before the massive success of 1984\u2019s Born in the U.S.A. \u2014 which only made him more fearless in his activism. \u201cThere was no going back,\u201d Van Zandt says. \u201cSo I became a bit suicidal at that point, which was very helpful. It didn\u2019t help my marriage maybe, but it put me, in a situation where I could talk to [South African liberation group] the Azanian People\u2019s Organization, tough characters, to accomplish what I felt needed to be accomplished instead of being scared about it or fearful for my life, which anybody logical and reasonable would\u2019ve been. I didn\u2019t care. Take that machete out and cut my head off. I don\u2019t give a shit. You know what I mean? At that point, I was like, \u2018You wanna kill me? You\u2019d be doing me a favor.\u2019 So I wasn\u2019t the least bit afraid, and I think that came from that suicidal impulse, that I had ended my life and done such a stupid thing. But somehow, you hang in there \u2014 and destiny shows you, you\u2019re not done yet.\u201d Download and subscribe to Rolling Stone\u2018s weekly podcast, Rolling Stone Music Now, hosted by Brian Hiatt, on Apple Podcasts or Spotify (or wherever you get your podcasts).

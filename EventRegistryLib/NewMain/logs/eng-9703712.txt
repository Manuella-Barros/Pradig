Battles Over Future Dives Are Still Possible", "body": "NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The U.S. government has officially ended its legal fight against an upcoming expedition to the Titanic shipwreck after the company that owns the ship's salvage rights scaled back its dive plans.\n\nBut the U.S. said in court filings last week that it may wage court battles over future expeditions if they break a federal law and an agreement with Great Britain to treat the wreck as a gravesite.\n\nThe litigation began last year after RMS Titanic Inc. announced the expedition, which is now scheduled for mid-July. The Georgia-based company originally planned to take images inside the ocean liner's severed hull and to retrieve artifacts from the debris field.\n\nRMST also said it would possibly recover free-standing objects inside the Titanic, including from the room where the sinking ship broadcast its distress signals.\n\nThe U.S. filed its legal challenge in August, arguing that entering the Titanic -- or physically altering or disturbing the wreck -- is regulated by the 2017 federal law and pact with Britain.\n\nBoth regard the site as a memorial to the more than 1,500 people who died when the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank in 1912. Among the government's concerns is the possible disturbance of artifacts and any human remains that may still exist on the North Atlantic seabed.\n\nIn October, RMST said it had significantly pared down its dive plans. That's because its director of underwater research, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, died in the implosion of the Titan submersible near the Titanic shipwreck in June.\n\nThe Titan was operated by a separate company, OceanGate, to which Nargeolet was lending expertise. Nargeolet was supposed to lead this year's RMST expedition.\n\nRMST stated in a February court filing that it will send an uncrewed submersible to the site and only take external images.\n\n\"The company will not come into contact with the wreck,\" RMST stated, adding that it \"will not attempt any artifact recovery or penetration imaging.\"\n\nThe U.S. government stated in a June 27 court filing that it's ending its legal efforts against the expedition because of the company's revised dive plans.\n\nBut the government said future expeditions could be illegal. It noted that the firm's longer-term objectives still involve the possible retrieval of objects from inside the wreck and surrounding debris field. For that reason, the U.S. said it wants to leave the door open for future legal battles. Specifically, the government said it may still pursue last year's motion to intervene as a party in RMST's salvage case with a federal admiralty court.\n\nRMST has been the court-recognized steward of the Titanic's artifacts since 1994. Its last expedition was in 2010, before the federal law and international agreement took effect.\n\nThe company has recovered and conserved thousands of Titanic artifacts, from silverware to a piece of the ship's hull, which millions of people have seen through its exhibits.\n\nU.

a firm who owns salvage rights to one of the most famed shipwreck's in the world - the Titanic.\n\nRMS Titanic Inc are aiming to conserve the tragic history of the Titanic, which saw it's demise in April 1912, for future generations.\n\nThe announcement comes a year after the Oceangate disaster claimed the lives the company's CEO Stockton Rush, 61, Hamish Hardin, 58, Paul Henry Nargeolet, 77, and father-and-son Shahzada, 48 and Suleman Dawood, 19.\n\nOn June 18, 2023, the expedition which cost \u00a3250,000 per ticket, disappeared after it plunged into the sea to explore the remains of the Titanic.\n\nThe company was slammed for flouting warnings of the risks and offering cut-price tickets to some of those on the trip - and an investigation is ongoing.\n\nAccording to the Independent, the US federal government had tried to prevent RMS Titanic's dive last year, citing federal law as well as an international agreement that categorised the wreckage as a gravesite.\n\nHowever the organisation have since gained permission to search the area after explaining they seek to disturb the wreckage as little as possible.\n\nThey said this includes 'the hull of the ship and the remains of those 1,500 souls lost in the sinking of the ship.'\n\nDespite the challenges, the company confirmed to the Independent, that their mission was still going ahead next month.\n\nAccording to the publication, this year's dive will be entirely unmanned with vehicles being remotely operated.\n\nThe firm told a Reddit thread last week, that they intend to keep the ROV's under water for 20 days in total, so they can gather as much information about the site as they can.\n\n'We aren't using manned submersibles this time around, so thankfully we don't have to worry about that, just the cabin fever of being stuck on the ship,' they penned.\n\nThis most recent expedition will be the RMS Titanic Inc's first since 2010 - and they intend to use the most advanced technology.\n\nDuring the dive, they hope to document items they can possibly recover on future expeditions.\n\nThey also aim to gather as much mew detail about the tragedy, with the company quipping the wreckage may be packed with 'surprises'.\n\nOne of their main aims is to retrieve the Marconi wireless system - a piece of equipment which was used to send the SOS signal during the disaster in the North Atlantic.\n\nThe firm will not be entering the ship itself during next month's dive, the Independent reports.\n\nLying on the bottom of international water, no one owns the Titanic ship, however RMS Titanic Inc was given exclusive rights to salvage the wreckage.\n\nThese rights were handed to the firm via an agreement established between Liverpool and London Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association in 1994.\n\nMailOnline has reached out to RMS Titanic Inc for more information.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Titanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Exhibitions", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier Exhibitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marine salvage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wreck_of_the_Titanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wreck of the Titanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shipwreck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hull (watercraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wireless telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submersible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Submersible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steamship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Scuba_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Scuba Diving", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Nautical", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Nautical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Powerlifting", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Powerlifting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/02/18/86840019-13593197-image-a-1_1719940011281.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703712", "eventUri": "eng-9703712", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 701, "textEnd": 708}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 232, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - The U.S. government has officially ended its legal fight against an upcoming expedition to the Titanic shipwreck after the company that owns the ship's salvage rights scaled back its dive plans.\n\nBut the U.S. said in court filings last week that it may wage court battles over future expeditions if they break a federal law and an agreement with Great Britain to treat the wreck as a gravesite.\n\nThe litigation began last year after RMS Titanic Inc. announced the expedition, which is now scheduled for mid-July.

On Thursday, June 27, 2024, the U.S. government officially ended its legal fight against an upcoming expedition to the Titanic shipwreck after the company that owns the ship's salvage rights scaled back its dive plans. (AP Photo, File)\n\nIn October, RMST said it had significantly pared down its dive plans. That\u00b4s because its director of underwater research, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, died in the implosion of the Titan submersible near the Titanic shipwreck in June.\n\nThe Titan was operated by a separate company, OceanGate, to which Nargeolet was lending expertise. Nargeolet was supposed to lead this year\u00b4s RMST expedition.\n\nRMST stated in a February court filing that it will send an uncrewed submersible to the site and only take external images.\n\n\"The company will not come into contact with the wreck,\" RMST stated, adding that it \"will not attempt any artifact recovery or penetration imaging.\"\n\nThe U.S. government stated in a June 27 court filing that it's ending its legal efforts against the expedition because of the company's revised dive plans.\n\nBut the government said future expeditions could be illegal. It noted that the firm's longer-term objectives still involve the possible retrieval of objects from inside the wreck and surrounding debris field. For that reason, the U.S. said it wants to leave the door open for future legal battles. Specifically, the government said it may still pursue last year's motion to intervene as a party in RMST's salvage case with a federal admiralty court.\n\nRMST has been the court-recognized steward of the Titanic\u00b4s artifacts since 1994. Its last expedition was in 2010, before the federal law and international agreement took effect.\n\nThe company has recovered and conserved thousands of Titanic artifacts, from silverware to a piece of the ship's hull, which millions of people have seen through its exhibits.\n\nU. S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith is the maritime jurist who presides over Titanic salvage matters in Norfolk, Virginia. She said during a March court hearing that the U.S. government\u00b4s case against RMST would raise serious legal questions if it continues, while the consequences could be wide-ranging.\n\nCongress is allowed to modify maritime law, Smith said in reference to the U.S. regulating entry into the sunken Titanic. But the judge questioned whether Congress can strip courts of their own admiralty jurisdiction over a shipwreck, something that has centuries of legal precedent.\n\nIn 2020, Smith gave RMST permission to retrieve and exhibit the radio that had broadcast the Titanic\u00b4s distress calls. The U.S. government responded by filing an official legal challenge against the expedition.\n\nThe court battle never played out. RMST indefinitely delayed those plans because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSmith noted in March that time may be running out for expeditions inside the Titanic.

regulated by the 2017 federal law and pact with the UK.\n\nBoth regard the site as a memorial to the more than 1500 people who died when the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank in 1912.\n\nAmong the government's concerns is the possible disturbance of artefacts and any human remains that may still exist on the North Atlantic seabed.\n\nIn October, RMST said it had significantly pared down its dive plans because its director of underwater research, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, died in the implosion of the Titan submersible near the Titanic shipwreck in June.\n\nThe Titan was operated by a separate company, OceanGate, to which Nargeolet was lending expertise.\n\nNargeolet was supposed to lead this year's RMST expedition.\n\nRMST stated in a February court filing that it will send an uncrewed submersible to the site and only take external images.\n\n\"The company will not come into contact with the wreck,\" RMST stated, adding that it \"will not attempt any artefact recovery or penetration imaging\".\n\nThe US government stated in a June 27 court filing that it is ending its legal efforts against the expedition because of the company's revised dive plans.\n\nBut the government said future expeditions could be illegal.\n\nIt noted that the firm's longer-term objectives still involve the possible retrieval of objects from inside the wreck and surrounding debris field.\n\nFor that reason, the US said it wants to leave the door open for future legal battles.\n\nSpecifically, the government said it may still pursue last year's motion to intervene as a party in RMST's salvage case with a federal admiralty court.\n\nRMST has been the court-recognised steward of the Titanic's artefacts since 1994.\n\nIts last expedition was in 2010, before the federal law and international agreement took effect.\n\nThe company has recovered and conserved thousands of Titanic artefacts, from silverware to a piece of the ship's hull, which millions of people have seen through its

The paying guests forked out $250,000 each for a chance to see the wreck.\n\nWhat followed was an intense international search and rescue mission before its debris were recovered near the bow of the Titanic.\n\nIt was then concluded that it had suffered a \"catastrophic implosion\", instantly killing British billionaire Hamish Harding, 58; Pakistani billionaire Shahzada Dawood, 48; and his son Suleman Dawood, 19.\n\nThe Independent has reached out to RMS Titanic Inc for further information.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Titanic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Exhibitions", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier Exhibitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submersible", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Submersible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remotely_operated_underwater_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Remotely operated underwater vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipwreck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shipwreck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guinness World Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine salvage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hull (watercraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wireless telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steamship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Admiralty law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_waters", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International waters"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search and rescue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Scuba_Diving", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Scuba Diving", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster_Relief_and_Recovery", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Disaster Relief and Recovery", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_uk_the_independent_us_164/8a7e55e66f80fc7cf70a613dc5b9437d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9703712", "eventUri": "eng-9703712", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

She said during a March court hearing that the U.S. government's case against RMST would raise serious legal questions if it continues, while the consequences could be wide-ranging.\n\nCongress is allowed to modify maritime law, Smith said in reference to the U.S. regulating entry into the sunken Titanic. But the judge questioned whether Congress can strip courts of their own admiralty jurisdiction over a shipwreck, something that has centuries of legal precedent.\n\nIn 2020, Smith gave RMST permission to retrieve and exhibit the radio that had broadcast the Titanic's distress calls. The U.S. government responded by filing an official legal challenge against the expedition.\n\nThe court battle never played out. RMST indefinitely delayed those plans because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSmith noted in March that time may be running out for expeditions inside the Titanic. The ship is rapidly deteriorating.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I think at the heart of Titanic is this human connection point that can cause wonderful moments for students where they take this topic and find their own personal connection to it.\n\nWhy do you think we still connect to the Titanic so much?\n\nI think at the core of it, there's so much mystery and unknowing that comes around for the topic of Titanic. I think a lot of my colleagues and I will say that one question will lead to another question, will lead to another question. And I see the same thing happens in the classroom where they just want to know more.\n\nThere's still so much that we don't know about the Titanic, and I know that we have these expeditions coming up. What are they hoping to find?\n\nThrough these expeditions and the expedition coming up in July, we have the opportunity to take high resolution imaging of the ocean floor and really take a look at what is down there and be able to make targeted efforts for recoveries later.\n\nHow does one get involved in the upcoming expedition?\n\nI would always direct someone to go to our website, Expedition.DiscoverTitanic.com. There's information about the expedition there, where you can become a member and get exclusive virtual access to the expedition including interviews and footage. I highly encourage you to look there. If you are on social media, go to our different social media channels. We'll have updates there and ways to get involved too for those who are in the classroom and wanting to bring Titanic into your own classroom. We have materials and curriculum also on our website, and we are creating new and more materials that will be coming out later this year.\n\nJoin RMS Titanic, Inc.'s digital community at Member.DiscoverTitanic.com.

Battles over Future Dives Are Still Possible | LatestLY", "body": "Norfolk (US), Jul 3 (AP) The U.S. government has officially ended its legal fight against an upcoming expedition to the Titanic shipwreck after the company that owns the ship's salvage rights scaled back its dive plans.\n\nBut the U.S. said in court filings last week that it may wage court battles over future expeditions if they break a federal law and an agreement with Great Britain to treat the wreck as a gravesite.\n\nAlso Read | Python Swallows Woman After Crushing Her to Death in Indonesia, Husband Kills Giant Snake to Retrieve Body; Chilling Details Emerge.\n\nThe litigation began last year after RMS Titanic Inc. announced the expedition, which is now scheduled for mid-July. The Georgia-based company originally planned to take images inside the ocean liner's severed hull and to retrieve artifacts from the debris field.\n\nRMST also said it would possibly recover free-standing objects inside the Titanic, including from the room where the sinking ship broadcast its distress signals.\n\nAlso Read | Delhi: PWD Minister Atishi Inspects Centralised Monsoon Control Room To Assess Waterlogging Situation in National Capital (See Pics and Video).\n\nThe U.S. filed its legal challenge in August, arguing that entering the Titanic -- or physically altering or disturbing the wreck -- is regulated by the 2017 federal law and pact with Britain.\n\nBoth regard the site as a memorial to the more than 1,500 people who died when the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank in 1912. Among the government's concerns is the possible disturbance of artifacts and any human remains that may still exist on the North Atlantic seabed.\n\nIn October, RMST said it had significantly pared down its dive plans. That's because its director of underwater research, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, died in the implosion of the Titan submersible near the Titanic shipwreck in June.\n\nThe Titan was operated by a separate company, OceanGate, to which Nargeolet was lending expertise. Nargeolet was supposed to lead this year's RMST expedition.\n\nRMST stated in a February court filing that it will send an uncrewed submersible to the site and only take external images.\n\n\"The company will not come into contact with the wreck,\" RMST stated, adding that it \"will not attempt any artifact recovery or penetration imaging.\"\n\nThe U.S. government stated in a June 27 court filing that it's ending its legal efforts against the expedition because of the company's revised dive plans.\n\nBut the government said future expeditions could be illegal. It noted that the firm's longer-term objectives still involve the possible retrieval of objects from inside the wreck and surrounding debris field. For that reason, the U.S. said it wants to leave the door open for future legal battles. Specifically, the government said it may still pursue last year's motion to intervene as a party in RMST's salvage case with a federal admiralty court.\n\nRMST has been the court-recognized steward of the Titanic's artifacts since 1994.

I think at the heart of Titanic is this human connection point that can cause wonderful moments for students where they take this topic and find their own personal connection to it.\n\nWhy do you think we still connect to the Titanic so much?\n\nI think at the core of it, there's so much mystery and unknowing that comes around for the topic of Titanic. I think a lot of my colleagues and I will say that one question will lead to another question, will lead to another question. And I see the same thing happens in the classroom where they just want to know more.\n\nThere's still so much that we don't know about the Titanic, and I know that we have these expeditions coming up. What are they hoping to find?\n\nThrough these expeditions and the expedition coming up in July, we have the opportunity to take high resolution imaging of the ocean floor and really take a look at what is down there and be able to make targeted efforts for recoveries later.\n\nHow does one get involved in the upcoming expedition?\n\nI would always direct someone to go to our website, Expedition.DiscoverTitanic.com. There's information about the expedition there, where you can become a member and get exclusive virtual access to the expedition including interviews and footage. I highly encourage you to look there. If you are on social media, go to our different social media channels. We'll have updates there and ways to get involved too for those who are in the classroom and wanting to bring Titanic into your own classroom. We have materials and curriculum also on our website, and we are creating new and more materials that will be coming out later this year.\n\nJoin RMS Titanic, Inc.'s digital community at Member.DiscoverTitanic.com.

and 3.30pm and is suitable for all the family.\n\nLocal historian Bill Fitzpatrick will bring the whole family on a trip back in time to the events of the Titanic which occurred 112 years ago.\n\nUp to three children can get into the event free of charge with every adult or concession ticket purchased.\n\nMore than 1,500 people died when the ship sank to the bottom of the Atlantic on April 15, 1912, hours after striking an iceberg on the fourth day of its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York.\n\nBill, an expert on the Titanic and many other aspects of maritime history, will be speaking all about the events of that fateful night along with the crew and more about The Titanic itself.\n\nAfter the talk there will be a Q&A and a number of educational workshops for everyone to enjoy, including a chance to learn Morse code, which was used by the Titanic's crew to send emergency wireless messages calling for help, and to find out about how the ship was built.\n\nThose taking part will also be given the opportunity to design and build their very own model boats and put them to the test to see it is able to keep afloat.\n\nRefreshments are included.\n\nEva Bukowska, exhibitions and events officer at the Scottish Maritime Museum, said: \"This family event is always very popular, so we highly recommend everyone books their ticket in advance.\n\n\"Whether you're a

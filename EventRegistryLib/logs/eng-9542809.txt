Unfortunately, they were unable to complete the sweep against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Padres are 5-5 through their past 10 games.\n\nThe Cubs are coming off a series where they took two of three games from the Milwaukee Brewers. This allowed them to enter the week in a tie for first place in the National League Central. The Cubs are 5-5 over their past 10 games.\n\nThe Cubs defeated the Padres 4-3 last season. Now, they hope to pick up where they left off and start the season series on a good note at Wrigley.\n\nYu Darvish starts for the Padres. He is 1-1 with a 3.45 ERA. Recently, he tossed five shutout innings while allowing three hits as he claimed his first win of the season by overcoming the Cincinnati Reds. Darvish is 2-2 with a 2.76 ERA through five games.\n\nShota Imanaga starts for the Cubs. The amazing rookie is 5-0 with a 0.78 ERA. Now, Imanaga hopes to continue his beautiful start to his major league career.\n\nThe Padres have had a great offense this season. Currently, they are fourth in batting average, seventh in on-base percentage, and second in runs. The Padres are also sixth in home runs and fifth in slugging percentage. Ultimately, they have gotten some production from the majority of their lineup, and many of their hitters have good marks against the Cubs.\n\nJurickson Profar is batting .300 with two home runs, five RBIs, and 15 runs over 21 games against the Cubs. Also, he has stolen five bases. So if he can get on base, he can be dangerous. Then, there is the guy behind him. Fernando Tatis Jr. is hitting .262 with three home runs, 10 RBIs, and five runs through 10 games against Chicago. Therefore, expect him to be a major threat in this series.\n\nManny Machado is batting .323 with three home runs, 13 RBIs, and 14 runs through 25 games. Now, the veteran will try to keep the momentum going against Chicago. But Xander Bogaerts has struggled against the Cubs. Unfortunately, he is hitting just .150 with an on-base percentage of .261 against the Cubs with only one home run, three RBIs, and five runs over 17 career games against them.\n\nThe Padres are 20th in team ERA, which is very unlike them. Additionally, they are 16th in bullpen. Darvish will try to keep the ship afloat for the Padres.\n\nThe Padres will cover the spread if their lineup can generate some early scoring to give Darvish a good cushion. Then, they need Darvish to have a quality start and for the bullpen to avoid collapsing down the stretch.\n\nWhy The Cubs Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Cubs struggle for consistency at the plate, ranking just 19th in batting average and 13th in on-base percentage. Yet, they are also eighth in runs, which showcases that they are finding ways to score. The Cubs are also 11th in home runs and 14th in slugging percentage. Overall, they have hitters who have struggled against the Padres.\n\nNico Hoerner is batting just .225 with an on-base percentage of .304 with nine RBIs and nine runs over 20 games. Ultimately, he is producing when he hits. But he doesn't hit the ball nearly enough. Meanwhile, Ian Happ is also struggling to do anything against the Padres. Happ is batting just .208 with an on-base percentage of .276 with four home runs, 20 RBIs, and 16 runs over 39 games against San Diego. Thus, he needs to show he can do something against them to give the Cubs a chance to win.\n\nChristopher Morel needs to do more. So far, he is hitting just .235 with three home runs, nine RBIs, and seven runs over 10 games against the Padres. Morel is a clear example of \"feast or famine\" when it comes to the Cubs. Therefore, the Cubs need to see the good side of him. Dansby Swanson is batting .202 with seven home runs, 25 RBIs, and 18 runs through 47 games against the Padres.\n\nThe Cubs are 17th in team ERA. Furthermore, they are also 22nd in bullpen ERA. Their pitching staff has been inconsistent. Yet, Imanaga has held the Cubs together.\n\nThe Cubs will cover the spread if Imanaga can have a great start. Then, they need their lineup to generate scoring chances.\n\nFinal Padres-Cubs Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Padres have been playing well recently. However, they will face a red-hot pitcher who is playing out of his mind. Until he shows signs of any weakness, it will be challenging to see a scenario where he falters. The Cubs give him some run support and then find a way to cover the spread at home against the Padres to start this new series.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rb_hayek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rb Hayek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Darvish", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yu Darvish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shutout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrigley Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Tat\u00eds_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Tat\u00eds Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurickson_Profar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurickson Profar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dansby_Swanson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dansby Swanson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._A._Happ", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

However, the Padres would then fail to win a series against the lowly Rockies before getting swept by the Phillies. You could say Padres fans aren't too happy, as the starting pitching has continued to put the team behind in games and the offense hasn't took off yet.\n\nXander Bogaerts was moved out of the leadoff spot after his really slow start (.216 AVG, .573 OPS) and to make things worse, Fernando Tatis Jr. and Manny Machado haven't been outstanding either. Jurickson Profar and Jackson Merrill -- two guys making less than $2 million this season combined -- are instead the standout performers offensively. The Padres hope the recent acquisition of Luis Arraez will help jumpstart their offense.\n\nCubs fans -- you might be catching the Friars at the right time.\n\nThe Cubs lost two of three to the Padres at San Diego on April 8-10. The three games at Wrigley Field starting today will conclude the season series, after the Cubs' 38th game of the season. Wednesday will be the earliest date of a season finale between the teams, surpassing May 14 in 2006. The only other finale before June was May 21, 2015.\n\nThe Cubs' next win vs. the Padres at Wrigley Field will be their 150th there since the rivalry began in 1969. The 149 wins so far are the Cubs' most at home since then against any team that never was in the same division as the Cubs. They have won 148 vs. the Astros, 139 vs. the Giants, 132 vs. the Braves, 123 vs. the Dodgers and 112 vs. the Brewers. They won 65 at home vs. the Marlins, who were in the NL East along with the Cubs for Miami's first season, 1993.\n\nThe Cubs' winning percentage at home against the Padres, .582 (149-107), is their best since 1969 against any NL opponent. They are .563 vs. the Rockies and .550 vs. the Cardinals. The Cubs have winning percentages of .583 to .727 vs. seven AL teams, the lowest vs. the Rangers (7-5) and highest vs. the Mariners (8-3). They have played as many as 20 games against only two of the seven, going 12-8 vs. the Royals and Twins.\n\nWednesday: Hayden Wesneski, RHP (2-0, 0.54 ERA, 0.720 WHIP, 2.02 FIP) vs. Dylan Cease, RHP (4-2, 2.55 ERA, 0.803 WHIP, 2.50 FIP)\n\nNOTE: Joe Musgrove was originally scheduled to start Tuesday, but he was placed on the 15-day injured list Sunday with triceps tendinitis. Randy Vasquez was recalled from Triple-A El Paso and while it's not official yet, this article says he will be the starter Tuesday.\n\nThe Padres have allowed 176 runs, sixth-most in MLB, and 43 home runs, fourth-most. What I'm saying here is that the Padres pitching staff might be just what the Cubs need to kick-start their offense.\n\nThe Cubs have really good pitchers going in this series. The Padres have a couple guys going who have done well so far in Darvish and Cease, but ... gonna pick two of three again.\n\nThe Cubs have Thursday off, then travel to Pittsburgh to face the Pirates in a three-game series at PNC Park beginning Friday evening.", "source": {"uri": "bleedcubbieblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleed Cubbie Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nMerrill hits two-run homer in loss\n\nJackson Merrill went 2-for-4 with a two-run homer in a loss to the Diamondbacks. The rookie launched a 394-foot home run in the second inning and also had a 102.4 mph single later in the game. Merrill is more of a contact-oriented hitter, so the exit velocities are nice to see as we dream on his power upside. The 21-year-old is slashing .284/.333/.388 with two home runs and 16 RBI on the year. He's a better real-life player than a fantasy player, but he has enough tools to be a high-floor fantasy asset, especially if you need batting average.\n\nHoerner doubles, drives in pair of runs\n\nNico Hoerner doubled and drove in a pair of runs on Sunday, propelling the Cubs to a 5-0 victory over the visiting Brewers. Hoerner opened the scoring in the ballgame with a two-run double off of Freddy Peralta in the home half of the fifth inning. He then advanced to third on a ground ball and dashed home on a wild pitch with the Cubs' third run of the day. The speedy 26-year-old infielder finished the afternoon 1-for-5 and is now hitting .282/.358/.397 with one home run, 10 RBI and four swipes through his first 34 games of the 2024 season.\n\nCubs are 2-5 SU in their last 7 games when playing at home against San Diego\n\nPadres vs. Cubs MLB BETTING PREDICTION\n\nTake the under.

You may be wondering about the record, thinking the math doesn't add up. You'd be correct. This is why I stress playing games with only the listed pitchers if you tail me. On Saturday, I put in a play on the Mets and Luis Severino pitching. He was scratched and the Rays went on to win the game 3-1. I don't write it in every article, which may not be fair to the new readers, but it also would be overly repetitive considering I post daily. I have a bet for today's game between the Padres and the Cubs - make sure your bet is on the pitchers listed.\n\nThe Padres just made a splash in the trade market, landing one of the best contact hitters in baseball, Luis Arrarez. He made an immediate impact for them, going 4-for-6 in his debut. This guy is a great addition to a club that could do some damage if there are some baserunners on. This isn't the first time the Padres have tried to make a change in the season and grab a great available player. The question is if this one can turn the team around and propel them to some wins. So far, the team is 1-1 with him in the lineup. The offense really isn't the issue for the Padres, though I don't think the pitching staff is all that bad either. The staff has a 4.28 ERA and a 1.26 WHIP. Opponents are hitting .241 against them though. I think the issue has to be that they are allowing too many hits with runners in scoring position. Yu Darvish is taking the ball for the Padres tonight, but he hasn't been the problem for the Padres. Darvish is off to a nice start with a 3.45 ERA and a 1.15 WHIP. This is fairly in line with what he has done in his career. He isn't going overly deep into games though, as he has gone over five innings just once this season in six starts. Darvish has held the Cubs hitters to just .208 over their at-bats against him (15-for-72). Only three of those hits have gone for extra bases.\n\nIf you look at the two clubs in today's contest, the Cubs are 21-14 and the Padres are 18-19. The Cubs are hitting .237 compared to the Padres .259. They've scored 21 fewer runs, 50 fewer hits, and have a lower On Base Percentage and Slugging Percentage. The Cubs do have a better ERA (3.75 to 4.28) than the Padres, but they have identical WHIPs. They've issued about the same amount of walks and equal strikeouts. They have held their opponents to a lower batting average than the Padres. Maybe the Cubs record is a product of using their runs at the right time or being better when runners are in scoring position both on offense and when pitching. Today the Cubs get a boost to the rotation as well as they get Justin Steele. Steele is their ace and was the Opening Day starter this season. He made it through 4.2 innings and allowed just one earned run and three hits in that time. This could be huge as the Cubs already have one great pitcher in the rotation with Shota Imanaga, and now Steele could give them two great options. He went 5.1 innings last year against the Padres and allowed just three hits and two walks.\n\nThis is a game that could see Steele come back and dominate, or he could struggle against a very good lineup. Darvish is one of the better pitchers out there, and the Cubs are missing some of the key pieces of their lineup. They are also coming off of a big weekend series against the Brewers where they took two of three games. This might be a bit of a letdown spot so I'll take the Padres through five innings. It is very possible that Steele pitches well and dominates this game, but I prefer to take the Padres to through in five.\n\nFor more sports betting information and plays, follow David on X/Twitter: @futureprez2024", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_troy@outkick.com", "name": "David Troy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Darvish", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yu Darvish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contact hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh\u014dta_Imanaga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sh\u014dta Imanaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opening Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1431561268-e1691598381578.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542809", "eventUri": "eng-9542809", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

But the lefty remains a game-changer. He had six strikeouts through 4 2/3 innings in that first start, and I see his return giving the hosts a jolt here.\n\nThe Cubs are 12-4 at Wrigley Field and picked up a pair of victories this weekend to win their series against the Brewers. I like that form to carry over tonight and and I'm grabbing the Chicago moneyline against the visiting San Diego Padres.\n\nI'm also expecting run support for Steele, who went 16-5 with a 3.06 ERA and 1.17 WHIP while finishing fifth in NL Cy Young voting in 2023.\n\nThe Cubs have scored five or more runs in three of their last four contests -- and, though San Diego starter Yu Darvish pitched five scoreless innings last Tuesday against the Cincinnati Reds, he had given up at least three runs in his three prior starts.\n\nThe Padres edged the three-game series between these teams in April, but this feels like a good spot for the hosts to get some payback while keeping the heat on the Brewers at the top of the NL Central.\n\nNico Hoerner has eight hits in his last five games, boosting his batting average to .282 in the process. Hoerner had a dominant weekend, with three RBI against the Brewers, including a home run in Saturday's win. I see him being at the center of the Cubs' scoring again today.\n\nMeanwhile, Luis Arraez announced himself on his Padres debut with a perfect 4-for-4 outing on Saturday from the lead-off spot -- and there's no option of pitching around him with Fernando Tatis Jr., Jake Cronenworth, and Manny Machado on deck.\n\nHis pedigree at the plate is no secret after posting a .354 batting average with the Miami Marlins in 2023. If Steele takes a few innings to hit his stride, Arraez is a candidate to cash in, especially after mashing 30 or more doubles in each of the last two seasons. And while Arraez does fare worse against lefties than he does vs. righties, he still hit .326 off southpaws last season and is batting .276 against them in 2024.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Cubs have been happy to pile up victories in low-scoring battles, hitting the Under in 19 of their last 30 contests.

But, the Cubs were 0-5 with runners in scoring position and stranded five runners.\n\nHere are four takes from the Cubs series opener against the NL Central first-place Brewers.\n\nThe Cubs rotation has been hampered with injuries, but the pitchers filling in have not missed a beat.\n\nGetting the start on a lovely Friday afternoon, Wesneski was stellar and methodical. He finished his day after 6.1 innings, striking out eight and walking two, but he did not allow a run for his first quality start of the season.\n\nEven as the Cubs' offense sputtered with runners in scoring position - the Cubs were 0-5 with RISP going into the seventh - Wesneski kept going strong.\n\nHe threw 90 pitches on the afternoon, with 54 called strikes.\n\nIt was a stellar day.\n\nShota Imanaga was honored as the Cubs Player of the Month in April ahead of Friday's game, and rightfully so.\n\nThe Cubs' big free agent splash is 5-0 so far on the year with a sub 1.00 ERA. If you're making early Cy Young Award watch lists, Imanaga has to be at least talked about even just a month in.\n\nBut, Wesneski is putting together a stellar start to his own season in a year where the Cubs have taken their set of bruises in the rotation, literally.\n\nWith Jordan Wicks, Justin Steele and Kyle Hendricks missing time on the injured list, the pressure has been on Wesneski and Wesneski has delivered through April and again as May started.\n\nWesneski started the day with a 0.68 ERA. That figure went down nine points to 0.59 by the bottom of the fifth inning. Wesneski's ERA is now at 0.56 in five appearances and three starts. He has a 2-0 record.\n\nThe Cubs start May against the Brewers and end it against the Cardinals. Having a pitching staff that can carry the load as the regular starters get healthy for the back end of the month could be a sign of things to come for the latter months of the season.\n\nIt wasn't that the Cubs' offense was in a rut against the Brewers. They just couldn't get the one hit they needed to plate a few runners.\n\nThe Cubs had five hits going into the sixth inning. They also had a few head-scratching mistakes.\n\nOne of those was a fifth-inning double by Nico Hoerner, but Hoerner got caught on the basepaths mid-pitch for a put out that ended the fifth. Another was Miguel Amaya trying to stretch a single into a double, which had no chance of happening, in the seventh.\n\nIn the sixth, however, Christopher Morel got the sixth hit of the day for the Cubs. That hit was not with any runners in scoring position, but it did fly an estimated 413 feet into center field.\n\nThat continues Morel's solid play in the past week. He's hit three home runs and driven in six RBI in the past five games.\n\nThe Morel home run gave the Cubs a 1-0 lead, but the Brewers took advantage of Wesneski's exit.\n\nThree RBI singles in the eighth gave the Brewers a 3-1 lead. Adbert Alzolay was charged with all three earned runs.\n\nThe Cubs stranded Hoerner in the eighth inning. The Cubs went down in order in the ninth.

Before Adbert Alzolay blew yet another game for the Cubs, Hayden Wesneski had been fantastic, firing 6 1/3 scoreless innings in his second start of the season. He yielded three hits, walked two and struck out eight in the no-decision, lowering his ERA to 0.54.\n\nChicago bounced back to even the series on Saturday with a 6-5 win. The bullpen struggled again, giving up five runs over the final three innings and nearly squandering another gem by Jameson Taillon. Taillon tossed six scoreless frames, allowing only two hits and two walks while striking out seven. Unlike Wesneski, he received the win, improving to 3-0 with a 1.13 ERA in four starts this season.\n\nThe Cubs got yet another masterful performance during Sunday's rubber match. Javier Assad delivered six shutout innings, scattering four hits and three walks while fanning four. This time the bullpen avoided any hiccups, securing a 5-0 victory and the series win.\n\nAccording to Chicago's graphics coordinator Christopher Kamka, this was the first time in modern franchise history (dating back to 1901) that Cubs starters threw at least six scoreless innings in every game of a series that lasted at least three games.\n\nThe record is even more mind-blowing given that two of the three starters (Wesneski and Assad) are relatively inexperienced, and none of the three has ever been an All-Star. The staff accomplished it without co-aces Justin Steele and Shota Imanaga, both of whom are scheduled to pitch during this week's series against the San Diego Padres.\n\nIt was good timing for Chicago, which moved into a tie with Milwaukee for first place in the NL Central. The strong series also continued a remarkable run for the Cubs' rotation, which has a 2.03 ERA over its last 17 games. Surprisingly, Chicago is only 10-7 over those games due to some inconsistent offense (4.18 runs per game) and shaky relief work (especially from Alzolay) during that stretch.\n\nDespite dealing with injuries to Steele, Kyle Hendricks and Jordan Wicks, the Cubs' rotation hasn't just persevered -- it's flourished.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_maher@si.com", "name": "Tyler Maher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Taillon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Taillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrigley Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shutout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adbert_Alzolay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adbert Alzolay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Win\u2013loss record (pitching)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Steele", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Steele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Hendricks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Hendricks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Railroad_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Railroad Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4513,h_2538,x_0,y_181/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx60kdd9ckdeansfyr", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542809", "eventUri": "eng-9542809", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Right now, on the morning of May 6, 2024, my Cubs cup is as full as I can remember it in quite a while. Chicks may dig the long ball, but this dude digs starting pitching. The Cubs are in the midst of one of the longest runs of strong starting pitching that I can remember. Hayden Wesneski, Jameson Taillon and Javier Assad just faced the team's main division rival Milwaukee Brewers, all threw at least six innings and none of them allowed a run.\n\nSavvy fans on both sides of the rivalry know that any given stretch of games is but a tiny microcosm of the season. But, there's no way if you are on the Brewers side of things that you aren't a little uneasy this morning, even leaving town with a first-place tie. Sure, you are going to tell yourself that the games were largely close and you are, of course, right. See: microcosm. But, you can't be happy about it. Particularly, since it got worse for the Brewers as the weekend went on. Sunday's game did not feature the requisite tightrope act from the Cubs bullpen.\n\nWorse still for the Brewers, this Cubs offense is still a pale shadow of the relentless attack we saw from it earlier in the year. Sure, that vision of the offense could be a mirage. Or, this offense could be struggling a bit without two of its best hitters. It certainly isn't going to hurt the team to add Cody Bellinger and Seiya Suzuki to the mix. But the real cherry on top is that the Cubs starters just blanked the Brewers for three games and none of those three games were started by this year's best starter to date, Sh\u014dta Imanaga, or last year's best starter, Justin Steele.\n\nThe Cubs have played 21-14 ball and are tied for first place in the Central and nearly half of their expected significant contributors have already spent time on the injured list. To say that this team passed the test with flying colors would be an understatement. To be 21-14 and to feel like there were probably more games that you should have won that you lost than games that you should have lost that you won is fantastic. There are no guarantees, but this team might have a chance to be a real contender.\n\nThe photo for the history book is still being developed. But this is a team we can dream on. If Craig Counsell and the front office grow and nurture this team right, they'll be in the conversation. Do you have to at least have pause about the Braves and Dodgers with their stacked lineups? No question. But, for all of their hype, those teams were both eliminated last year by an upstart, unheralded Diamondbacks team. Don't tell me that it isn't at least possible to get hot and reach the World Series with a good team.\n\nLet's find three star performances on a day when nearly every performance was positive.\n\nGame 35, May 5: Cubs 5, Brewers 0 (21-14)\n\nReminder: Heroes and Goats are determined by WPA scores and are in no way subjective.\n\nWPA Play of the Game: Nico Hoerner batted in the fifth with runners on first and second with one out against Freddy Peralta in a scoreless game. He doubled and the first two runs of the game scored (hat tip to Miguel Amaya scoring from first). (.212)\n\n*Brewers Play of the Game: For those wondering how Swanson's line ended up on the wrong side of the ledger, it was already 3-0 by the time he homered (.039) but in the fourth inning it was scoreless when he batted with a runner on first and one out. He hit a line drive that ended up with a double play. (.063) If that ball finds a hole, Dansby is comfortably on the Sidekick podium.\n\nCubs Player of the Game:\n\nYesterday's Winner: Jameson Taillon picked up 92 percent of the vote. Seven votes for someone else, that appeared to be Patrick Wisdom from the comments. I missed that opportunity for sure.\n\nRizzo Award Cumulative Standings: (Top 4/Bottom 4)\n\nThe award is named for Anthony Rizzo, who finished first in this category three of the first four years it was in existence and four times overall. He also recorded the highest season total ever at +65.5. The point scale is three points for a Superhero down to negative three points for a Billy Goat.\n\nUp Next: The Padres come to town at 18-19. The Cubs lost two of three to them in San Diego in early April and will look to return the favor. The Cubs start some fellow just back from the minor leagues named Justin Steele (0-0, 1.93). The Cubs will surely be ecstatic to welcome back their ace, even after watching three different starters go six or more innings without allowing a run over the weekend.\n\nHe'll face a former Cubs ace in Yu Darvish (1-1, 3.45). I don't have to tell anyone here about Yu's history as you are all quite familiar with him. What not all of you may know is how the 37-year-old righty is holding up as he drifts into the back end of his career. Yu just collected his first win of the season against the Reds the last time through the rotation. He threw five scoreless and allowed only three hits and no walks. Yu has only had one start longer than five innings, way back on April 2 and that one was actually a loss. So get there early if you are going to see our old pal Yu.\n\nThe Cubs scored four runs on first hits and three walks against Yu in San Diego. That was one of the first nights I remember being really impressed with the Cubs offense this year. I'd be ecstatic if they could do that again. But this game scares me after a really, really strong weekend against a rival.", "source": {"uri": "bleedcubbieblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleed Cubbie Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They allowed 24 hits and walked 14 (0.942 WHIP) and struck out 33.\n\nSeriously, you can't ask for more than that. And now Justin Steele is being added back to that group. The Cubs, right now, might have the best starting rotation in MLB.\n\nIt's hard to pick out just one to highlight, but I chose Imanaga's outstanding work against the Mets [VIDEO].\n\nMorel tends to hit home runs in bunches and he did so this past week with four of them.\n\nSince he had only two other hits all week (both singles), that led to kind of a weird batting line of .261/.414/.783 (6-for-23) with nine RBI. Perhaps even better were the three walks drawn -- Morel's turned into something of a patient hitter. It's great to see.\n\nHere's the absolute monster of a home run he hit on Saturday [VIDEO].\n\nA reminder that the wind was blowing in strongly for this one [VIDEO].\n\nWhat a valuable player Tauchman has turned himself into -- a great fourth outfielder, but also a guy who can start every day for a significant period of time and contribute.\n\nFor the week Tauchman went just 5-for-25 but also drew three walks for a .333 OBP over the week... and also contributed defense like this [VIDEO].\n\nThe pen did its job Sunday with three scoreless innings.\n\nBut before that, over the previous six games? Yikes. 15\u2154 total innings, nine earned runs (5,17 ERA, and 13 total runs allowed), 20 hits and five walks allowed (1.596 WHIP), 21 strikeouts.\n\nAnd that includes two games in which the pen gave up NO runs.\n\nThings seemed better Sunday, but the entire bullpen needs more consistency. The Cubs went 4-3 over the week and with better relief work that would have been at least 5-2 or maybe even 6-1.\n\nAmaya was supposed to take on more of the catching workload this year and eventually succeed Yan Gomes as the starter. This week, though, was not good: He started six of the seven games and batted just .077/.235/.077 (1-for-13), and for the season he's now batting .188/.266/.290 (13-for-69) with 18 strikeouts.\n\nWorse, though, is his defense -- he's just not throwing runners out at all. The Brewers ran like crazy against him on Friday, stealing five bases. (No, it didn't help that Cubs pitchers didn't do a good job of holding the runners.) For the season Amaya has thrown out just one of the 16 runners trying to steal against him. That has to improve, especially before the Cubs face the Reds, who lead MLB in stolen bases: 57, with just 11 caught stealing.\n\nSwanson hit just .136/.208/.273 (3-for-22) over the last week with eight strikeouts. And, he made some uncharacteristic errors Saturday.\n\nHe did show some signs of coming out of both slumps on Sunday, with this slick defensive play [VIDEO].\n\nHopefully, that's the start of a hot streak for Dansby.", "source": {"uri": "bleedcubbieblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleed Cubbie Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "al_yellon@bleedcubbieblue.com", "name": "Al Yellon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh\u014dta_Imanaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sh\u014dta Imanaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jameson_Taillon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jameson Taillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrigley Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_player_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utility player (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_Gomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yan Gomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught_stealing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caught stealing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SnN9GnVn6PAuhNuma8NgreeStZE=/0x51:1379x741/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25435450/usa_today_23171778.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542809", "eventUri": "eng-9542809", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

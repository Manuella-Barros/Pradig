{"id": 243298808, "title": "As UAW 'is being watched with a microscope,' new investigation puts Fain in crosshairs", "text": "The UAW and its president, Shawn Fain, have ridden a wave of positive press and momentum since last year\u2019s strike against the Detroit Three and the new contracts that came at Ford Motor Co., General Motors and Jeep- and Chrysler-owner Stellantis. Fain, who came to power following last year\u2019s first direct election of top UAW leaders, appeared well-positioned to continue leading the union\u2019s more aggressive posture at a time of great change in the auto industry with a command of powerful rhetoric and a sense of showmanship on display during the strike. Time even named him to its list of 100 most influential people of 2024. The union\u2019s image had also regained some of the luster lost in recent years, particularly after the successful campaign to organize the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, this year. But earlier this month, the independent monitor overseeing the union put a spotlight on divisions in the highest ranks of the UAW as he announced that Fain and Secretary-Treasurer Margaret Mock were under investigation following a shake-up within the leadership. In separate instances, Mock and Vice President Rich Boyer had duties stripped, including Boyer\u2019s oversight of the Stellantis Department. Fain took action directly against Boyer; the International Executive Board took a vote in Mock\u2019s case. Both defended their own actions, and both cases involved allegations of retaliation and financial misconduct, according to the monitor. Despite the monitor emphasizing that no conclusions had been reached and that the claims remain allegations, the situation puts the UAW\u2019s leadership in an uncomfortable spot and reminds the world in clear terms that the union remains under federal oversight stemming from the wide-ranging corruption scandal that landed former top union leaders and auto executives in prison. The scandal even led to a conviction for FCA US, the U.S. operating arm of Stellantis. 'It raises the specter of corruption again' Experts who\u2019ve watched the UAW closely in recent years came to relatively similar conclusions following the release of the monitor\u2019s report: that this is a serious matter for those involved \u2014 in fact, it's not beyond the realm of possibility that the monitor could demand Fain's removal. The labor experts also say the fact of the investigation will hamper the UAW\u2019s efforts to organize nonunion auto plants, a push that came up short in the recent loss at Mercedes-Benz in Alabama, where the company was accused of aggressively fighting the union effort at the same time Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey was disparaging \u201cthis threat from Detroit.\u201d \u201cIt plays into the hands of those who want to block the UAW from becoming more powerful in the auto industry. It takes the wind out of the sails,\u201d said Marick Masters, professor emeritus and labor expert at Wayne State University. \u201cIt raises the specter of corruption again, which is something they really just got over.\u201d Masters said that without supporting evidence of wrongdoing being presented publicly, Fain should be given the benefit of the doubt. He said it\u2019s \u201cunfathomable\u201d that Fain would not have been aware of the consequences of retaliation within the union. But the existence of the investigations can\u2019t be ignored. \u201cA cloud looms over until you get these things resolved,\u201d he said. Fain has defended himself, painting the situation as a reaction to someone who would \u201crock the boat\u201d from those who support the status quo. \u201cWe encourage the monitor to investigate whatever claims are brought to their office, because we know what they\u2019ll find: a UAW leadership committed to serving the membership, and running a democratic union. We\u2019re staying focused on winning record contracts, growing our union, and fighting for economic and social justice on and off the job,\u201d according to a recent statement from Fain. But Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said that even if one assumes Fain hasn\u2019t done anything wrong, it\u2019s serious to go through an investigation. No one, he said, enjoys the process, although individuals typically \u201cput on a brave face.\u201d Gordon compared the exercise to having someone go through your sock drawer. Has the UAW really moved away from its authoritarian past? And he reiterated the seriousness of the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s a big step to name somebody individually. You wouldn\u2019t want to take that step unless you had some reason to believe that that particular person did something wrong. It\u2019s different than looking at sloppy practices,\u201d Gordon said of the monitor\u2019s decision to reveal who is being investigated. \u201cIf you say you\u2019re investigating a particular person, that\u2019s really focused.\u201d Gordon also described the situation as it unfolded as \u201csort of a surprisingly bad public relations move\u201d given Fain\u2019s past adeptness in getting his message across. His skills were on display, for example, with the use of a wastebasket for certain automaker contract proposals during Detroit Three bargaining. It also raises questions about the environment within the organization, Gordon said. \u201cThe UAW traditionally is authoritarian with vindictive leaders and as much opaqueness as you can get away with. Some of the rank and file were hoping there\u2019d be less of that going forward,\u201d he said. Powers of the UAW special monitor What it ultimately means will, of course, depend next on the conclusions drawn by the monitor. At this point, it\u2019s not clear when any follow-up report or action will take place, although the monitor said in a footnote that he \u201cwill report further about the impact of these divisions within the union in a report concerning his compliance mandate that is anticipated to be filed shortly.\u201d The monitor communicates with the public on his actions primarily through federal court filings, although his office does have a webpage that provided regular updates during the UAW leadership elections, which his office oversaw. The Free Press has made numerous requests \u2014 none granted \u2014 over the years, including following the release of the latest status report, to interview the monitor, Neil Barofsky, a former assistant U.S. attorney and current partner in the Chicago law firm Jenner & Block. The consent decree stemming from the union's corruption scandal sets in place a six-year term of oversight by the monitor. Barofsky\u2019s appointment was OK\u2019d by U.S. District Court Judge David Lawson in May 2021. The monitor\u2019s charge is broad, with the consent decree giving him \u201cthe authority and duty to remove fraud, corruption, illegal behavior, dishonesty and unethical practices from the UAW and its constituent entities.\u201d The oversight by the independent monitor means that internal divisions and disagreements in addition to specific actions are much more likely to be brought to light. Masters described the situation as a fishbowl. Monitor has power to demand that Fain be removed \u201cIt makes it abundantly clear that the UAW is under government scrutiny and everything the UAW does is being watched with a microscope,\u201d Masters said. The investigations could find no wrongdoing on the part of Fain or others. The moves to shift responsibilities on the International Executive Board could instead be found to be more in the vein of management disagreements.But if not, the consequences could be significant. \u201cThe full range is a very full range. It could result in a recommendation that some practice be ended or that some new practice be started. It could result in some form of admonition, a smack on the hand with a ruler. It could result in a demand that Fain step down,\u201d according to Gordon. If, during the course of the investigation, something is found that involves criminality, it could be turned over to the Justice Department, he said. The monitor\u2019s latest report noted, for instance, that two of the 24 investigations into \u201cpost-consent decree misconduct\u201d have already been referred to the Justice Department. The report also said an embezzlement probe had been opened into an unnamed regional director, with the monitor referencing investigations of three members of the International Executive Board: Fain, Mock and the regional director. The monitor could also pursue disciplinary charges through either the UAW\u2019s constitutional process, which uses a trial committee, or the court-approved adjudications officer, currently Gil Soffer, who is chair-elect and managing partner in the Katten Muchin Rosenman law firm\u2019s Chicago office. The adjudications officer, like the monitor, is an independent position stemming from the consent decree with the power to dole out discipline up to and including expulsion from the union. Referral of cases to the UAW\u2019s ethics officer is an option, too. Remaining divisions within the union Whatever is decided, Masters noted that \u201cthe recommendation of the monitor is going to carry a great deal of weight not only with the adjudications officer but also with the International Executive Board,\u201d a group where loyalties are likely now being tested. Board control had been with candidates who ran as reformers in the election that wrapped up last year, but the election results created a divided board from the get-go. The divisions that have emerged are interesting in light of the fact that Fain, Mock and Boyer all ran on the same slate, opposing the administration caucus that controlled the UAW for decades. Despite the contested nature of the election that included a lengthy runoff process, the two sides did strike a united tone during last year\u2019s special bargaining convention in Detroit as the union set its sights on then-upcoming talks with the Detroit Three. Election controversies didn\u2019t die with the declaration of Fain\u2019s win, however. Just recently, Judge Lawson breathed life into a challenge by Will Lehman, a Mack Trucks worker who had been one of the unsuccessful candidates for UAW president in the initial round of the election. Lehman had sued the Labor Department and acting Secretary Julie Su in July over the department\u2019s handling of a complaint he filed seeking to have the election rerun. Lawson\u2019s opinion filed Tuesday called the department\u2019s dismissal of 30 of 34 grievances listed by Lehman arbitrary and capricious, denied a motion for dismissal of the Lehman complaint and remanded the case back to the department for further proceedings, \u201cwhich, at a minimum, must consist of the production of a supplemental statement of reasons.\u201d Lehman was highly critical of how the election was run, highlighting low participation that he said was intentionally suppressed, and he has been outspoken in his disdain for the UAW bureaucracy and its leadership.

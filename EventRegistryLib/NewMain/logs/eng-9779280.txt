triathlon champion Alex Yee, telling him to \"take a bow\", as Team GB gathers medal momentum on the fifth day of the Paris Olympics.\n\nAround 15 minutes after Yee's success, Great Britain's women's quadruple sculls crew - featuring Hannah Scott, Lola Anderson, Georgie Brayshaw, and Lauren Henry - claimed gold in a dramatic race to the line with the Netherlands.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Beth Potter won bronze in the women's individual triathlon and Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson also came third in the women's synchronised 10m platform dive.\n\nYee went to the ground after completing the race, with second-placed Hayden Wilde, from New Zealand, sitting down next to him and wrapping an arm around Yee's shoulder.\n\nBrownlee posted a story to Instagram after the race with the caption \"Take a bow @lixsanyee\".\n\nLess than an hour before, Fred Sirieix was among an emotional crowd of Team GB supporters as he celebrated his daughter's bronze medal in the women's synchronised 10m platform dive.\n\nThe First Dates star, 52, cheered with both hands in the air as Spendolini-Sirieix and Toulson secured third place at the Aquatics Centre.\n\nToulson's partner - Great British diver Jack Laugher - was in tears in the stands as it became clear that the pair had sealed a spot on the podium.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, the first triathlon race kicked off with the women's individual event which saw Potter, from Glasgow, win a bronze medal.\n\nIn the same event, Team GB's Georgia Taylor-Brown came sixth and Kate Waugh 15th.\n\nTaylor-Brown's boyfriend, French triathlete Vincent Luis, posted a selfie of the couple to his Instagram story and said he was \"so proud\".\n\nWaugh's school hosted a breakfast watch party for the early morning event - with students, parents and teachers arriving at 6.45am for the screening, which was complete with a Parisian breakfast spread of croissants and pain au chocolates.\n\nAngela Ponton, director of sport for Royal Grammar School Newcastle, told the PA news agency: \"It was just brilliant to have people here celebrating Kate and her achievements.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think she'll be disappointed because she wants to do the best she can, she wants to win but it's a phenomenal achievement and getting there to the Olympics, getting to Paris 2024 is unbelievable.\n\n\"So to get 15th is amazing, is really,

Lauren Henry - claimed gold in a dramatic race to the line with the Netherlands.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Beth Potter won bronze in the women's individual triathlon, and Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson also came third in the women's synchronised 10m platform dive.\n\nYee slumped to the ground after completing the race, with second-placed Hayden Wilde, from New Zealand, sitting down next to him and wrapping an arm around Yee's shoulder.\n\nBrownlee posted a story to Instagram after the race with the caption \"Take a bow @lixsanyee\".\n\nAnderson fulfilled a childhood dream with her gold medal on Wednesday.\n\nBefore he died, her father gave her a note that she had written as a child which said her dream was to one day win Olympic rowing gold.\n\nThrough tears, the rower told the BBC: \"I had forgotten about it, obviously, but a couple years ago my dad reminded me and I know that he would be so, so proud.\n\n\"I'm just thinking a lot about him right now and it's really lovely.\"\n\nBrayshaw's father, Robert, listed his daughter's accolades on Facebook: \"Georgie Brayshaw - European Champion, World Champion, World Record Holder and now Olympic Champion.\"\n\nAway from rowing, Fred Sirieix was among an emotional crowd of Team GB supporters as he celebrated his daughter's bronze medal in the women's synchronised 10m platform dive.\n\nThe 52-year-old First Dates star cheered with both hands in the air as Spendolini-Sirieix and Toulson secured third place at the Aquatics Centre.\n\nToulson's partner - fellow GB diver Jack Laugher - was in tears in the stands as it became clear that the pair had sealed a spot on the podium.\n\nEarly on Wednesday morning, the first triathlon race kicked off with the women's individual event which saw Potter, from Glasgow, win a bronze medal.\n\nIn the same event, Team GB's Georgia Taylor-Brown came sixth and Kate Waugh 15th.\n\nTaylor-Brown's boyfriend, French triathlete Vincent Luis, posted a selfie of the couple to his Instagram story and said he was \"so proud\".\n\nWaugh's school hosted a breakfast watch party for the early-morning event - with students, parents and teachers arriving at 6.45am for the screening, which was complete with a Parisian breakfast spread of croissants and pains au chocolat.\n\nAngela Ponton, director of sport for Royal Grammar School Newcastle, told the PA news agency: \"It was just brilliant to have people here celebrating Kate and her achievements.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think she'll be disappointed because she wants to do the best she can, she wants to win, but it's a phenomenal achievement and getting there to the Olympics, getting to Paris 2024 is unbelievable.\n\n\"So to get 15th is amazing, is really, really good, and I think it's only just going to spur her

It was just fabulous to see her coming across the line.\"\n\n\"She's really happy because that, for her, is the culmination of three years' work from Tokyo and she's been rowing since she was 13 so it's just the job done,\" she added.\n\nAway from rowing, Fred Sirieix was among an emotional crowd of Team GB supporters as he celebrated his daughter's bronze medal in the women's synchronised 10m

Vincent Luis, posted a selfie of the couple to his Instagram story and said he was \"so proud\".\n\nWaugh's school hosted a breakfast watch party for the early-morning event - with students, parents and teachers arriving at 6.45am for the screening, which was complete with a Parisian breakfast spread of croissants and pains au chocolat.\n\nAngela Ponton, director of sport for Royal Grammar School Newcastle, told the PA news agency: \"It was just brilliant to have people here celebrating Kate and her achievements.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think she'll be disappointed because she wants to do the best she can, she wants to win, but it's a phenomenal achievement and getting there to the Olympics, getting to Paris 2024 is unbelievable.\n\n\"So to get 15th is amazing, is really, really good, and I

proud\".\n\nAngela Ponton, director of sport for Royal Grammar School Newcastle, told the PA news agency: \"It was just brilliant to have people here celebrating Kate and her achievements.\"\n\nShe added: \"I think she'll be disappointed because she wants to do the best she can, she wants to win but it's a phenomenal achievement and getting there to the Olympics, getting to Paris 2024 is unbelievable.\n\n\"So to get 15th is amazing, is really, really good, and I think it's only just going to spur her on for Los Angeles 2028.\"", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType":

It sees GB at fourth in the medal table behind Australia, France, China and the United States with six golds, six silvers and five bronze.\n\nHere's all our need to know as Britain won a fabulous five medals in Paris.\n\nWomen's quadruple scullers down Dutch in thriller\n\nTeam GB roared to their first-ever gold medal in women's quadruple sculls by winning one of the greatest rowing races ever seen. Lola Anderson, Georgie Brayshaw, Hannah Scott and Lauren Henry got their team off the medal mark in the most cinematic way imaginable.\n\nThe Netherlands led for 1,999 metres but not that one that mattered as the British quartet launched a fearsome sprint finish, throwing their bowball over the finish line first by a third of a canvas.\n\nYee reels in red-hot rival to clinch thrilling triathlon gold\n\nAlex Yee looked down and out in Paris only to take the script and throw it into the Seine. Yee must have seen Tom Pidcock and Andy Murray's comebacks of recent days and thought - 'I can raise that'.\n\nYee upgraded his Tokyo triathlon silver to gold in Paris, with a display of ruthless tactical racing genius that defied all conventional wisdom. He dramatically chased down New Zealand's Hayden Wilde, who seemed to have the gold in his grasp, to cross the line on the gilded Port Alexandre III.\n\nBMX boy wonder Reilly scoops brave silver\n\nHe might have been heavy favourite gold, but Kieran Reilly still hailed a \"special\" silver medal after an all-time BMX freestyle final. The 23-year-old from Gateshead agonisingly missed out by just 0.91 points in an hour of sport that will surely inspire thousands of kids on their summer holidays to head to the nearest park.\n\nReilly was pipped to the post by Argentina's Jose Torres Gil but only after a jaw-dropping run that had those packed in at the Place de la Concorde off their feet.\n\nPotter bags bronze just years after starting triathlon\n\nFrom a chance encounter in McDonalds to bronze in Paris, it wasn't quite Golden Arches to gold for Potter but she had no complaints. Potter made her Olympic debut eight years ago in Rio finishing 34th in the 10,000m.\n\nShe met two triathlon coaches while queuing for a burger, the conversation sparking a chain of events that saw her move her whole life to Leeds just a few weeks later, where she joined Alistair and Jonny Brownlee's training group.\n\nLast season saw Potter win her first world title and the Olympic test event but France's Cassandre Beaugrand got revenge from that loss when it really mattered, with Potter bagging bronze.\n\nSpendolini-Sirieix and Toulson twist and turn to another diving medal\n\nAndrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson won Great Britain's third diving medal at the Paris Olympics by snatching bronze at the last in the women's synchronised 10m platform.\n\nSpendolini-Sirieix, whose father Fred - a TV personality who stars in First Dates - was nervously watching poolside, and Toulson grabbed the medal with a superb final dive to lift them up from fourth.\n\nAs the pair completed the dive, Fred leapt from his seat in celebration and Spendolini-Sirieix, 19, and Toulson, 24, were in tears after Canada failed to better their score.\n\nWatch every moment of the Olympic Games Paris

The win was seen as a watershed moment for British rowing after a difficult Games in Tokyo, where the rowers had failed to win a single gold medal for the first time since 1980.\n\nAs Anderson celebrated in the Vaires-sur-Marne nautical stadium with her crewmates, she said the medal would join a scrap of paper given to her by her father shortly before his death as among her most treasured possessions.\n\nAnderson had been inspired as a 14-year-old watching the London 2012 Games by Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's rowing triumph in the women's pair to make a short entry in her diary.\n\n\"My name is Lola Anderson and I think it would be my biggest dream in life to go to the Olympics in rowing and if possible win a gold for GB,\" she wrote.\n\nAnderson later threw the diary entry in the bin but her father, Don, who had rowed at university, returned it to her two months before his death from cancer in 2019.\n\n\"I threw that away because I didn't believe,\" the 26-year-old said on Wednesday. \"I mean I was 14 at the time, so why would you believe that? My dad saw it before I did. He saw the potential I had, but my potential wouldn't have been unlocked without the girls that crossed the line with me today. I'm grateful for everyone who has got me here and he would be very proud if he was here.\"\n\nThe last-gasp victory by the women's rowing team was squarely matched for drama by the heroics of Yee, who had appeared to have run out of steam in the last kilometre of the run in the triathlon until he found an extra gear to pass New Zealand's Hayden Wilde and take gold. The two men collapsed to the ground together at the finish line and hugged.\n\nAsked about the spur for his sudden resurgence in the dying stretch of the race, Yee said: \"I don't even know. I was in quite a bad place, to be fair. I was going through a really bad patch. For me, I rode that wave and just said one more try and let's see if I can do it. I didn't give up.\n\n\"Almost two laps in I thought silver was on the cards. I owed it to myself to give myself one last chance and with about 2k to go I thought I'd give it everything I had. I'm just so proud I was able to do that for my family, for everyone who has worked hard, for my girlfriend Liv. There's so many more people than just me that have worked towards this. I am the lucky one who gets to do it.\n\n\"I was just saying: 'Anything can happen.' I'm still just that normal guy who works hard at my sport and loves what I'm doing. For me, it's amazing that I can be in this position and I just believed it.\"\n\nEarlier on Wednesday morning, Beth Potter claimed a bronze medal as large crowds on the banks of the Seine cheered on the home athlete Cassandre Beaugrand to gold in the women's triathlon. The Swiss athlete Julie Derron took silver.\n\n\"I am just so happy,\" said Potter, who switched to triathlon after coming 34th for Team GB over 10,000m in Rio in 2016. \"I was going for the gold but Cassandre and Julie were just too good. I have come a long way in eight years.\"\n\nAt the cycling venue on La Concorde, Kieran Reilly thought he had done enough to top the podium at the men's BMX freestyle final but narrowly lost out to Jos\u00e9 Torres Gil, who secured Argentina's first medal of the Games.\n\nReilly said of his silver medal: \"I felt proud of whatever was going to come up on that board. Whatever score I got, I was going to be happy with.\n\n\"I thought it might have been enough for gold, it wasn't. But I'm just as happy knowing that I went out there and I'll watch it back tomorrow and I know I'll be proud of everything I did and all the work that went into it.\"\n\nIn a dramatic final in the synchronised 10m platform at the aquatics centre in Saint-Denis, a bronze for Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix and her diving partner Lois Toulson came with a dramatic last dive that was enough to lift them into the podium places after a disappointing score for their third dive earlier in the competition.\n\nIt added to that by their teammates Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen, whose bronze on the opening day in the synchronised 3m springboard was the first diving medal for British women since 1960.\n\nSpendolini-Sirieix, whose's father Fred Sirieix from TV programme First Dates was poolside, said: \"It was so tense for us. First off, we didn't look at the scoreboard so we did not know how close it was. Our back twist is our strongest dive and we just wanted to be strong whatever happens.\n\n\"I was disappointed more than worried after the third dive because I knew we could bring it back. I gave it my all and let it all out. Just having family [here] and doing it alongside Lois is so much sweeter. I can't wait to celebrate with them.\"\n\nTeam GB now have 17 medals, including six gold, six silver and five bronze. UK Sport said the day had seen a milestone passed with a total of 300 women having won a first medal at a summer Games since National Lottery funding revitalised Britain's Olympic team after 1997.",

for BMX boy wonder Kieran Reilly, Yee's triathlon teammate Beth Potter and divers Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson.\n\nHere's all our need to know as Britain won a fabulous five medals in Paris.\n\nWomen's quadruple scullers down Dutch in thriller\n\nTeam GB roared to their first-ever gold medal in women's quadruple sculls by winning one of the greatest rowing races ever seen.\n\nLola Anderson, Georgie Brayshaw, Hannah Scott and Lauren Henry got their team off the medal mark in the most cinematic way imaginable.\n\nThe Netherlands led for 1,999 metres but not that one that mattered as the British quartet launched a fearsome sprint finish, throwing their bowball over the finish line first by a third of a canvas.\n\nAlex Yee reels in red-hot rival to clinch thrilling triathlon gold Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon8Cancel Play now\n\nAlex Yee looked down and out in Paris only to take the script and throw it into the Seine.\n\nYee must have seen Tom Pidcock and Andy Murray's comebacks of recent days and thought - 'I can raise that'.\n\nYee upgraded his Tokyo triathlon silver to gold in Paris, with a display of ruthless tactical racing genius that defied all conventional wisdom.\n\nHe dramatically chased down New Zealand's Hayden Wilde, who seemed to have the gold in his grasp, to cross the line on the gilded Port Alexandre III.\n\nBMX boy wonder Kieran Reilly scoops brave silver Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will auto-play soon8Cancel Play now\n\nHe might have been heavy favourite gold, but Kieran Reilly still hailed a \"special\" silver medal after an all-time BMX freestyle final,\n\nThe 23-year-old from Gateshead agonisingly missed out by just 0.91 points in an hour of sport that will surely inspire thousands of kids on their summer holidays to head to the nearest park.\n\nReilly was pipped to the post by Argentina's Jose Torres Gil but only after a jaw-dropping run that had those packed in at the Place de la Concorde off their feet.\n\nBeth Potter bags bronze just years after starting triathlon\n\nFrom a chance encounter in McDonalds to bronze in Paris, it wasn't quite Golden Arches to gold for Potter but she had no complaints.\n\nPotter made her Olympic debut eight years ago in Rio finishing 34th in the 10,000m.\n\nShe met two triathlon coaches while queuing for a burger, the conversation sparking a chain of events that saw her move her whole life to Leeds just a few weeks later, where she joined Alistair and Jonny Brownlee's training group.\n\nLast season saw Potter win her first world title and the Olympic test event but France's Cassandre Beaugrand got revenge from that loss when it really mattered, with Potter bagging bronze.\n\nAndrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson twist and turn to another diving medal\n\nAndrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson won Great Britain's third diving medal at the Paris Olympics by snatching bronze at the last in the women's synchronised 10m platform.\n\nSpendolini-Sirieix, whose father Fred - a TV personality who stars in First Dates - was nervously watching poolside, and Toulson grabbed the medal with a superb final dive to lift them up from fourth.\n\nAs the pair completed the dive, Fred leapt from his seat in celebration and Spendolini-Sirieix, 19, and Toulson, 24,

Yee, initially trailing New Zealand's Hayden Wilde, found an extra gear in the final moments, finishing with a time of 1:43:33 -- six seconds ahead of his competitor. This victory marks a significant improvement for the 26-year-old after earning silver in Tokyo.\n\nThe women's quad sculls crew, consisting of Lauren Henry, Hannah Scott, Lola Anderson, and Georgie Brayshaw, also had a dramatic race. After trailing the Netherlands throughout the final, they made a powerful push in the last moments to capture gold by a mere 0.15 seconds. Scott expressed her disbelief, saying, \"It's been a long time in the making and I still can't quite believe it.\"\n\nIn the evening, French swimmer Leon Marchand took center stage, achieving an unprecedented double by winning gold in both the 200m breaststroke and butterfly events. Marchand has now earned three gold medals at the Games, having previously won the individual medley.\n\nFrance celebrated another gold as Cassandre Beaugrand triumphed in the women's triathlon, while Team GB's Beth Potter finished in third place.\n\nBritish athlete Kieran Reilly clinched a silver medal in the men's BMX freestyle final, while divers Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix and Lois Toulson secured bronze medals for Great Britain.\n\nCurrently, Team GB holds a total of 17 medals, their highest tally at this stage of an Olympic Games.\n\nOriginally scheduled for Tuesday, the men's triathlon was moved to Wednesday due to poor water quality in the River Seine. After both races received the okay to proceed, Yee positioned himself well throughout the race.\n\nDuring the swim, he stayed with the leading group and took the lead early in the 10 km run after his teammate Sam Dickinson made a pre-planned sacrifice to assist him. Although Wilde briefly took the lead, Yee surged ahead in the final stages to claim victory, becoming Britain's second Olympic triathlon champion, following Alistair Brownlee.\n\nBeaugrand's gold came against a stunning backdrop of Paris landmarks, as she broke away from her competitors in the last kilometer to finish in 1:54:55. Potter, who transitioned from track to triathlon, had a commendable performance, coming in as defending world champion.\n\nAt the Vaires-sur-Marne Nautical Stadium, the GB women's quad sculls team aimed for their first Olympic title. After trailing initially, they overtook the competition in an exhilarating finish that saw them clinch victory.\n\n\"We kept it so cool to the end,\" Scott said, reflecting on their journey to gold.\n\nLater that evening, Marchand showcased his prowess in the pool, dethroning reigning champions Kristof Milak and Zac Stubblety-Cook in record-breaking times.\n\nKatie Ledecky continued to impress, becoming the first female swimmer to earn gold at four separate Olympics in the 1500m freestyle, completing the race more than 10 seconds ahead of her competitors.\n\nIn the men's BMX freestyle final, Reilly secured a silver medal with a thrilling performance, moving ahead of French favorite Anthony Jeanjean in a nail-biting finish.\n\nFinally, Spendolini-Sirieix and Toulson's bronze medals added to a growing legacy of British diving, marking a remarkable achievement for female divers in the Olympic Games.\n\nAs celebrations unfolded, Fred Sirieix, Spendolini-Sirieix's father, shared his pride on social media, celebrating his daughter's success with a glass of champagne. \"I am bursting with pride, bursting with happiness and joy. It feels like I'm going to explode,\" he remarked.\n\nOverall, day five proved to be a memorable one for Team GB, showcasing their strength and resilience across multiple sports as the Olympic Games

The win was seen as a watershed moment for British rowing after a difficult Games in Tokyo, where the rowers had failed to win a single gold medal for the first time since 1980.\n\nAs Anderson celebrated in the Vaires-sur-Marne nautical stadium with her crewmates, she said the medal would join a scrap of paper given to her by her father shortly before his death as among her most treasured possessions.\n\nAnderson had been inspired as a 14-year-old watching the London 2012 Games by Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's rowing triumph in the women's pair to make a short entry in her diary.\n\n\"My name is Lola Anderson and I think it would be my biggest dream in life to go to the Olympics in rowing and if possible win a gold for GB,\" she wrote.\n\nAnderson later threw the diary entry in the bin but her father, Don, who had rowed at university, returned it to her two months before his death from cancer in 2019.\n\n\"I threw that away because I didn't believe,\" the 26-year-old said on Wednesday. \"I mean I was 14 at the time, so why would you believe that? My dad saw it before I did. He saw the potential I had, but my potential wouldn't have been unlocked without the girls that crossed the line with me today. I'm grateful for everyone who has got me here and he would be very proud if he was here.\"\n\nThe last-gasp victory by the women's rowing team was squarely matched for drama by the heroics of Yee, who had appeared to have run out of steam in the last kilometre of the run in the triathlon until he found an extra gear to pass New Zealand's Hayden Wilde and take gold. The two men collapsed to the ground together at the finish line and hugged.\n\nAsked about the spur for his sudden resurgence in the dying stretch of the race, Yee said: \"I don't even know. I was in quite a bad place, to be fair. I was going through a really bad patch. For me, I rode that wave and just said one more try and let's see if I can do it. I didn't give up.\n\n\"Almost two laps in I thought silver was on the cards. I owed it to myself to give myself one last chance and with about 2k to go I thought I'd give it everything I had. I'm just so proud I was able to do that for my family, for everyone who has worked hard, for my girlfriend Liv. There's so many more people than just me that have worked towards this. I am the lucky one who gets to do it.\n\n\"I was just saying: 'Anything can happen.' I'm still just that normal guy who works hard at my sport and loves what I'm doing. For me, it's amazing that I can be in this position and I just believed it.\"\n\nEarlier on Wednesday morning, Beth Potter claimed a bronze medal as large crowds on the banks of the Seine cheered on the home athlete Cassandre Beaugrand to gold in the women's triathlon. The Swiss athlete Julie Derron took silver.\n\n\"I am just so happy,\" said Potter, who switched to triathlon after coming 34th for Team GB over 10,000m in Rio in 2016. \"I was going for the gold but Cassandre and Julie were just too good. I have come a long way in eight years.\"\n\nAt the cycling venue on La Concorde, Kieran Reilly thought he had done enough to top the podium at the men's BMX freestyle final but narrowly lost out to Jos\u00e9 Torres Gil, who secured Argentina's first medal of the Games.\n\nReilly said of his silver medal: \"I felt proud of whatever was going to come up on that board. Whatever score I got, I was going to be happy with.\n\n\"I thought it might have been enough for gold, it wasn't. But I'm just as happy knowing that I went out there and I'll watch it back tomorrow and I know I'll be proud of everything I did and all the work that went into it.\"\n\nIn a dramatic final in the synchronised 10m platform at the aquatics centre in Saint-Denis, a bronze for Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix and her diving partner Lois Toulson came with a dramatic last dive that was enough to lift them into the podium places after a disappointing score for their third dive earlier in the competition.\n\nIt added to that by their teammates Yasmin Harper and Scarlett Mew Jensen, whose bronze on the opening day in the synchronised 3m springboard was the first diving medal for British women since 1960.\n\nSpendolini-Sirieix, whose's father Fred Sirieix from TV programme First Dates was poolside, said: \"It was so tense for us. First off, we didn't look at the scoreboard so we did not know how close it was. Our back twist is our strongest dive and we just wanted to be strong whatever happens.\n\n\"I was disappointed more than worried after the third dive because I knew we could bring it back. I gave it my all and let it all out. Just having family [here] and doing it alongside Lois is so much sweeter. I can't wait to celebrate with them.\"\n\nTeam GB now have 17 medals, including six gold, six silver and five bronze. UK Sport said the day had seen a milestone passed with a total of 300 women having won a first medal at a summer Games since National Lottery funding revitalised Britain's Olympic team after 1997.",

I've had it since the Euros and it did me well there.\n\n\"I went to my first competition with it and did well, I decided I quite like it and I'm going with it. I'm not superstitious but it's done its job.\"\n\nThe men's golf gets under way at Le Golf National on Thursday, where some of the world's top players will be fighting it out for the

That was nearly half a second quicker than she had gone in the morning, but she missed out on a place in the final by just one spot.\n\nCompatriot Laura Stephens edged her into ninth, and Macinnes was understandably disappointed at coming so close.\n\nShe said: \"I'm a little bit disappointed, I won't lie. It was tough to make it back, a season's best would have done it.\n\n\"But I've swam really well here and I can't allow that to put a dampener on it.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Yee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alex Yee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triathlon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triathlon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowing_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rowing (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Britain"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding_at_the_2020_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Men's_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skateboarding at the 2020 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Richardson_(boxer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Richardson (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Spendolini-Sirieix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayden_Wilde", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hayden Wilde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beth Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandre_Beaugrand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cassandre Beaugrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lois_Toulson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lois Toulson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Butterfly stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/200_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "200 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freestyle_swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freestyle swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keanna_Macinnes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keanna Macinnes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Stephens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laura Stephens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Triathlon", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SEI_215084012.jpg?crop=0px%2C122px%2C2490px%2C1411px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9779280", "eventUri": "eng-9779280", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

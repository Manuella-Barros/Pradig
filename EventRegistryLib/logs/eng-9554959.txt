Namely, the Johnston administration and its partners are intent on expanding the boundaries of the Denver Downtown Development Authority to cover all of the city's core, including the long-floundering Central Business District.\n\nOnce expanded, that entity -- created to pay off $400 million in public debt incurred building infrastructure around the station -- would collect incremental property taxes from participating businesses and property owners to back bonds that can be used to fund a host of economic development work and projects, officials explained.\n\nWhat kind of work? City residents will have a chance to weigh in on that question, Johnston said\n\n\"This campaign will start with a conversation with downtown residents,\" Johnston said Thursday morning. \"Starting today we will go public with a website on which every Denverite can chime in with their own hopes and dreams for what they want from downtown.\"\n\nResidents can visit Denvergov.org/DDA for more information and share their thoughts.\n\nA handful of levers must be pulled before the plan can take effect, Johnston said.\n\nThe Denver City Council will have to take action on the plan. The mayor was flanked by council members Darrell Waston, Amanda Sandoval and Chris Hinds, whose district includes downtown. They will be leading efforts from the council side, Johnston said.\n\nThe governing board that oversees the Downtown Development Authority would also have to approve the changes as would the original residents and businesses that voted to establish the authority in its current footprint more than a decade ago, Johnston said.\n\nDoug Tisdal is the chair of the Downtown Development Authority, a post he was elected to after being appointed to the board as a representative for the Regional Transportation District. He sees Union Station's success and the avalanche of private sector investment that followed its reopening a decade ago as a key sales pitch for the proposed expansion.\n\n\"There's no reason we can't replicate elsewhere what we did here,\" Tisdale said Thursday, gesturing toward the station.\n\nProperty owners in the proposed new footprint would not be obligated to pay into the authority. They would opt in, Tisdale said.\n\nJohnston laid out the importance of downtown Denver in his view. It's not only an economic engine and key tax generator for the city at large, but the entire state and Rocky Mountain region, he said. Its current situation -- a 30% office vacancy rate as of the end of 2023 -- isn't unique in urban areas across the country, according to the mayor.\n\nBut reversing the trends is vital to the future.\n\n\"The COVID pandemic left our downtowns deserted. Hybrid working environments have reduced the demand on commercial office space. Without the commercial activation and life that made them vibrant, these deserted downtowns saw historic increases in homelessness and crime accelerated by a deadly wave of fentanyl addiction and commercial vacancies skyrocketed,\" Johnston said, describing the \"doom loop\" he and other partners are seeking to break.\n\nBut, he added, \"Denver refuses to walk away from our downtown as the vibrant center of financial, cultural, social, athletic and artistic activities.\"", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_rubino@denverpost.com", "name": "Joe Rubino", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Denver"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Union_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington Union Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnston_(Colorado_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnston (Colorado politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_collapse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic collapse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fountain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fountain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bus station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_business_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central business district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Waston", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kendall Waston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_City_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Property tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Transportation_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regional Transportation District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocky Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TDP-L-economyexpansion050924-cha-700.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554959", "eventUri": "eng-9554959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

More vacancies meant less activation meant more homelessness meant more crime and meant more vacancies, meant less activation and the pattern continued,\" said Johnston. \"This problem is not unique to Denver, but we need a uniquely Denver solution.\"\n\nStanding outside Union Station, flanked by council members, city leaders hope to chart a new path forward for downtown by looking back at the transformation of the rail station.\n\nSmall businesses fill a vacant downtown in pop-up programs\n\nThe idea is to extend the Downtown Development Authority (DDA), first established to fund Union Station transformations and bring millions of dollars of investments over the next 10 years into downtown.\n\n\"It was designed to capture additional revenue that was generated from incremental tax revenue that came after the Union Station effort was launched. That incremental revenue comes back to invest in infrastructure,\" said Johnston. \"\n\nIf approved by council and the DDA board, the taxing authority would extend beyond Union Station into the broader downtown area to finance improvements.\n\n\"We will extend the Downtown Denver Authority, a financing stream that was put into place to support the infrastructure and vision for Union Station,\" said Johnston. \"If we successfully activate that tool, that will allow us to invest more than $500 million into the investment in downtown.\"Johnston said the investments would come to downtown without new taxes.\n\n\"This is a taxing authority that was in place to finance the infrastructure on Union Station and we would extend the footprint of that authority to cover all of the central business district, which means businesses could opt in that region and we could make investments in that entire region,\" said Johnston.\n\nThe proposed expansion of the DDA investment area stretches around 6 blocks from 14th Street across to 20th Street and south of Union Station from around Wynkoop Street to Colfax Avenue.Portions of North Broadway to N. Grant Street would also be included in the expansion.\n\nThe mayor hopes to extend the DDA to an additional 15 years, but it would take three steps to make the change, starting with action from Denver's City Council.\"The council will lead an effort for a vote to ratify and extend the Downtown Denver Authority and will work with commercial and residents in the initial footprint to approve that extension,\" said Johnston.\n\nFollowing council approval, the board of the DDA would need to make an official decision to extend the boundaries beyond Union Station followed by approval from the initial group of electors that established the DDA footprint 15 years ago.\n\nThat vote by a group or residents and businesses to extend the boundaries would happen in November.\n\nIf those three steps happen, the mayor said funds could be redirected next year.\n\nDowntown Denver businesses shutter as leaders continue push for post-pandemic revival\n\n\"If all of those are successful, by the end of 2024 we will be prepared to start making investments in the first quarter of 2025 to turn this into what will be the most vibrant downtown neighborhood in America,\" said Johnston.A website will launch on Thursday seeking input from residents across Denver on what improvements Denverrites would like to see in downtown.\n\n\"This campaign will start with a conversation with downtown residents, starting today we will go public with a website on which every Denverrite can chime in with their own hopes and dreams for what they want from downtown,\" said Johnston. \"That would result in a criteria for investment that would come out at the end of this year that would guide the investment we would make in downtown,\"\n\nThe mayor said he hopes the funds would create more housing, childcare options and bring Denverrites back to downtown.\"We want to create magnetic, public spaces where people want to come and enjoy their time - some of what you see in places like Larimer Square where you have great, vibrant businesses - you have outdoor activations, you have recreational and pedestrian access,\" said Johnston. \"We want to help convert some of the existing commercial spaces that may be underutilized into residential opportunities,\"\n\nDenver\n\nDenver businesses shutter as leaders continue push for post-pandemic revival Rob Harris 8:48 PM, Feb 20, 2024\n\nThe DDA, first created in 2008, raised over $400 million in revenue through property and sales taxes collected near Union Station and Market Street Station, according to the city.Without the expansion of the DDA, the current structure would continue to only support investments around Union Station.\n\n\"We know we cannot have a thriving Denver without a thriving downtown. We can't have a thriving Colorado without a thriving Denver. We cannot have a Rocky Mountain west that thrives without a thriving Colorado,\" added Johnston. \"Which means the economic recovery of 10 states starts in this neighborhood.\"\n\nThe Follow Up What do you want Denver7 to follow up on?

Should we just give up on them as some relic from a bygone era?\"\n\nAs Johnston sees it, to make Downtown Denver vibrant, the city needs to invest half a billion dollars toward revitalizing it.\n\nDowntown Denver is a regional economic hub, and the entire region relies on its success, Johnston said.\n\n\"We know we cannot have a thriving Denver without a thriving downtown,\" he said. \"We can't have a thriving Colorado without a thriving Denver. We can't have a Rocky Mountain West that thrives without a thriving Colorado, which means the economic recovery of 10 states starts in this neighborhood.\"\n\n\"If we successfully activate that tool, that will allow us to invest more than $500 million dollars into the investment in Downtown,\" he said.\n\nAlongside him stood City Council members Amanda Sandoval, Darrell Watson, and Chris Hinds, who pledged to champion the expansion of the authority.\n\nConversations between the city, businesses and the Downtown Denver Partnership have already begun.\n\n\"We definitely need intervention to ensure that the investments that we've historically made are protected, and that we're moving Downtown forward,\" said Kourtny Garrett, head of the Downtown Denver Partnership.\n\nGarrett describes the potential $500 million investment as a \"force multiplier\" that will attract private sector investment in Downtown. The money could be used, in part, to fill financing gaps for developers wanting to convert office space into homes, projects that would otherwise be hard to fund.\n\nJohnston is starting a conversation with Downtown residents about what exactly they'd like to see. After that, all Denverites will have a say in the future of the city center.\n\nThe mayor has launched a website where residents can offer suggestions about what they want in a revitalized Downtown. There will also be meetings in neighborhoods citywide to gather residents' ideas for the city center.\n\nSpecific goals could include more daycare centers, parks, open space and the adaptive reuse of office buildings.\n\n\"Our vision is to create the fastest-growing economic engine in the West,\" he said. \"But one that also brings a more diversified central neighborhood district where people of all ages and incomes can make their home.\"\n\nIf Johnston has his way, Downtown won't just be a playground for the wealthy. Restaurant workers will be able to afford apartments close to their jobs, first-year nurses will be able to enjoy the fruits of the city center, and retirees will be able to safely relish their golden years.\n\nCity Council will ultimately need to approve the expansion of the Downtown Denver Authority, as would residents and businesses under the current authority.\n\nAs the mayor has focused his efforts on ending street homelessness in Downtown, he has moved many people from city center streets to neighborhoods across Denver. Some communities have complained that his efforts have created new issues in their communities, and some businesses outside Downtown say they need more economic support to stay afloat, too.\n\n\"We are deeply committed to a vibrant Denver in every neighborhood across the city,\" Johnston said. \"And we'll continue to work this year to roll out plans for how we have the same conversations across every neighborhood in Denver for what people want in their own neighborhoods.\"\n\nIn the fall, Johnston plans to host revitalization town halls in communities citywide, though the details are not yet firm.\n\n\"What we do know is Downtown is still the economic driver for the city,\" he said. \"Even if you work in Southeast or Northeast Denver, you have a business that relies on some of the economic activity of Downtown Denver, whether that's tourism, whether that's business, whether that's a tax revenue that comes from this location.\"\n\nAs Johnston sees it, people from every neighborhood congregate in Downtown to celebrate birthday dinners, enjoy sports, celebrate anniversaries and take a bike ride on Sunday mornings.\n\n\"We do think it is at the heart of the city,\" he said. \"But of course, we will pay attention to every part of the city, but we think this is the right place to begin.\"", "source": {"uri": "denverite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Denverite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnston_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnston (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Denver"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Union_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Union Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rocky Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fentanyl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_reuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adaptive reuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Urban_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Urban Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://wp-denverite.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/240509-MAYOR-MIKE-JOHNSTON-DOWNTOWN-UNION-STATION-PRESS-CONFERENCE-KEVINJBEATY-08-800x400.jpg?w=800&h=400&q=100&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554959", "eventUri": "eng-9554959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He said the city is working to add more child care facilities and create a workforce training program to prepare people to become early childhood educators.\n\n\"We also have a real child care desert in downtown and are working to open more sites downtown for folks who live and work here,\" Johnston said.\n\nHouse Bill 24-1223, which would simplify the affordable child care application process, cleared the legislature on Wednesday, giving the governor 30 days to sign it into law.\n\nHousing affordability\n\nMany residents had concerns about the cost of living and housing affordability in Denver.\n\n\"This is maybe the most important issue Denver is facing, this has to be a city where teachers and nurses and servers can afford to live,\" Johnston said.\n\nAffordable housing units\n\nHe said the city has a plan to bring 3,000 affordable units to the Mile High City each year. In those affordable housing units, tenants would pay 30% of their income for rent, and the price would not go up unless the tenant's income went up.\n\n\"If we can do 3,000 a year, that would put us on path for 25,000 affordable units over next 8 years, which would be most ambitious plan to close this gap of any city we know,\" Johnston wrote.\n\nJohnston said it is \"critical\" to build more affordable options for home ownership, specifically options that could be an opportunity for first-time home buyers.\n\nRecently, Colorado was ranked as the second-worst state for buyers looking for a starter home because of a lack of starter-sized homes and the fifth-most expensive median price for starter-sized homes of all the states.\n\nHousing density and permitting\n\nJohnston also said the city is working on adding more housing density around light rail spots and walkable neighborhoods. For example, he said there are plans for thousands of units near Central Park and the nearby light rail.\n\nConverting underutilized commercial spaces into residential options will be part of the effort to expand housing options that are affordable downtown, which Johnston said was a priority.\n\nA slow permitting process drives up developer costs and therefore drives up the cost for renters, so Johnston said the city is working on \"dramatically accelerating the permitting process this year,\" with hopes to shorten permitting time by 30% this year so projects can move faster.\n\nDowntown revitalization efforts and construction\n\nEncampments downtown\n\nJohnston said part of the efforts to revitalize downtown Denver includes getting people into housing.\n\n\"For the first time in as long as I can remember, there is not a single tent or encampment in downtown,\" Johnston wrote.\n\nHe said all the major encampments around downtown, uptown and City Park have not returned since they were closed and the amount of outdoor deaths has \"dramatically decreased\" since moving people indoors. He noted that over 1,500 people have been moved into housing and offered services like job support, substance misuse support and workforce training.\n\n16th Street Mall\n\nHe also addressed questions about the ongoing construction efforts happening downtown, especially around the 16th Street Mall.\n\nThe first few blocks of the 16th Street Mall will be open this summer, Johnston said, and construction is set to be complete by the end of summer in 2025. The mayor said he is working to make sure it is done on time and on budget.\n\nHe said the city is working on creating unique public spaces like Larimer Square in multiple locations and wants to highlight local businesses, featuring unique Denver brands of retail and food and drink at the mall.\n\nJohnston also said the city has a \"major announcement on big plans for downtown\" that will be released Thursday.\n\nPark Hill Golf Course\n\nAnother common concern among Denverites was the Park Hill Golf Course, a 155-acre space that has not been used by golfers for six years. Last month, the mayor told FOX31 that the city is looking at the next steps for the golf course, focusing on what the most effective outcomes for Denverites could be.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnston said he wants to see the old golf course be a gem for the Mile High City.\n\n\"The owner cannot let it rot, if they do not sell it they have to restore it to operations as a functioning golf course, but we think there could be better uses for the city and are working on it now,\" Johnston said.\n\nBike and pedestrian safety\n\nWith headlines about deadly crashes involving pedestrians in the news every week, residents shared concerns about pedestrian safety. Johnston said there are plans to improve pedestrian and cyclist safety around the city.\n\nAccording to data from the Colorado Department of Transportation, 133 pedestrians were killed on Colorado roadways in 2023, a 96% increase from 52 in 2013.\n\nHere are some things Johnston said are in progress regarding pedestrian and cyclist safety:\n\nOverall, Johnston said the city is working to make it safe and affordable for Denverites to travel without a car.\n\nSome projects are underway that are geared toward pedestrian safety, including projects on Federal Boulevard and West Colfax Avenue.\n\n\"We'll have an announcement coming in the next few weeks about how we can support the next phase of Vision Zero and prove that we can use all the tools at our disposal to make these high-injury networks vastly safer,\" Johnston said, referring to the city's goal of zero traffic-related deaths and serious injuries by 2030.\n\nDenver policing and 911\n\nJohnston addressed concerns about long wait times when people call 911 during an emergency in Denver.\n\nCurrently, there are three call lines in Denver: 311 to help people navigate city services, 911 for emergencies and a 10-digit non-emergency number.\n\nJohnston said the city is looking into the possibility of merging 311 and 911. He said the three numbers require separate staffing, and merging the two would allow for 24-hour weekend staffing on 311 and more resources to staff two lines well.\n\nEmergency dispatch is not alone in short staffing issues -- the Denver Police Department is short 167 officers right now. Johnston said the city is working to recruit diverse classes of officers and plans to restore staffing by the end of the year.\n\nHe noted that clearing encampments has opened up some time for officers.\n\n\"Last year we had more than 8000 calls to encampments alone which in some police districts took up more than 50% of our patrol time,\" Johnston said.\n\nHe said the city also plans to add more technology like cameras for speeding and running red lights as well as license plate readers. He said the license plate readers track stolen cars across the city. Residents can register a car to immediately track it if or when it is stolen, which is how Johnston said Denver police were able to help find his car when it was stolen.\n\nJohnston mentioned some plans for specific crimes as well. He said the city is working to break fentanyl rings, particularly in communities of color that are most affected.\n\nAdditionally, the police department and Colorado State Patrol have partnered with other agencies on a street racing task force, which Johnston said \"results in citations and the occasional seizure of a vehicle for nuisance abatement.\"", "source": {"uri": "kdvr.com", "dataType":

Rashford endured a difficult campaign in front of goal for United, scoring just eight times across all competitions. The forward did help United win the FA Cup by beating Manchester City in the final, but that did not help Rashford with his international ambitions. England manager Gareth Southgate left Rashford out of his 33-man provisional squad ahead of Euro 2024. The final 26-man list was confirmed earlier this week, and it will be the first major tournament that Rashford has not been involved in for the Three Lions since the 2014 World Cup. Stuart Pearce has experience on the international stage both during his playing and coaching careers, and the 62-year-old has sent a message to Rashford on what the United striker should do in order to become a success once again at Old Trafford.

I think it should be a wake-up call to this kid. \u201cThe talent that he has got. I have watched him at United, and every once in six games, he goes and does something, he gets you off your seat, he cuts inside and scores a wonderful goal. \u201cYou think, you are one of our most talented players, you should be leading this squad, and you forced the England manager [Southgate] to leave you out of the squad because of your form. \u201cThis is going to be harsh of me to say, he lacks real personality on a football pitch to grab his club side and take them to where they should be. \"He has been there since he was a kid. Grab the club by the scruff of the neck and lead the club. That\u2019s the age he is at the moment.\u201d", "summary": "Latest Manchester United news and gossip as Marcus Rashford is sent a message on how the recent omission from the England Euro 2024 squad could help his Old Trafford career", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/ive-watched-marcus-rashford-closely-29318677", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29318783.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2154655621.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:00:00", "author": "Mark Wakefield", "authors": ["Mark Wakefield"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.174}

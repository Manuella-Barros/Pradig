Domenico Tedesco's side would have been on the brink of elimination if they had suffered a second successive Group E defeat. But Tielemans' second-minute strike in Cologne eased fears of yet another major tournament flop from star-studded Belgium. Kevin De Bruyne wrapped up the points in the closing stages to leave all four teams in the group level on three points.

In the second half, we were better. With a bit of luck we could have got a point,\" said Romania coach Iordanescu.Belgium had failed to score in over 300 minutes at major tournaments since netting against Canada at the last World Cup.They needed less than two minutes to end that drought.Influential De BruyneA sweeping move climaxed when Jeremy Doku's pass found Romelu Lukaku in the Romania penalty area and he laid the ball back to Tielemans, who smashed a powerful low strike past Florin Nita from the edge of the area.Romania's Tottenham defender Radu Dragusin went close to equalising moments later with a towering header that Koen Casteels tipped over at full stretch.After an injury-plagued season with Manchester City, in which he failed to reach his usual sky-high standards, De Bruyne had looked below his best against Slovakia.The Belgium captain was far more influential this time, with a lung-bursting surge that ended with a pass to Dodi Lukebakio, whose strike was pushed away by Nita.Doku was denied by another good stop from Nita after wriggling through the over-worked Romania defence.Valentin Mihaila wasted a golden opportunity to equalise soon after half-time, pouncing on Amadou Onana's wayward pass and sprinting clear, only to blaze high into the stands.De Bruyne was moving through the gears ominously, curling just past the far post from 20 yards, then drawing a smart save from Nita with a shot on the turn.Lukaku had two goals, including a late equaliser, disallowed by VAR against Slovakia.The striker was denied by VAR again in the 63rd minute when he converted De Bruyne's pass before being ruled narrowly offside.Romania nearly profitted from that escape as Dennis Man raced clear, but couldn't find the accuracy to beat Casteels.De Bruyne finally delivered the knockout blow in the 80th minute, running onto Casteels' long punt and firing past Nita.\"You saw a team with lots of quality, they have speed, they have explosion, power. They are a complete team. They are a candidate to win the title,\" Iordanescu said of Belgium.(This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "summary": "Youri Tielemans breathed new life into Belgium's Euro 2024 campaign as the Aston Villa midfielder's goal after just 73 seconds inspired a vital 2-0 win against Romania on Saturday.", "url": "https://sports.ndtv.com/football/belgium-beat-romania-to-breathe-new-life-into-euro-challenge-5949425", "image": "https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-06/cfl0vlc8_belgium-afp_625x300_23_June_24.jpg?im=FitAndFill,algorithm=dnn,width=806,height=605", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:28:25", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.02}

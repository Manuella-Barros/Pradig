Klitschko survived a knockdown in the fifth round to rally hard and have Joshua on unsteady legs by the end of the same round. He then dropped Joshua and hand him in serious trouble during the sixth. Joshua eventually came back in the championship rounds to score two more knockdowns of his own to stop Klitschko in the eleventh.\n\nThere was a rematch clause in place and there were already moves being made to set down the second fight.\n\nA few weeks ago, Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn had flown over to Las Vegas to take a tour of the T-Mobile Arena - which was likely going to host the second fight on a date in November.\n\nJoshua, who owed a mandatory defense to the IBF, had even received permission from the sanctioning body to face Klitschko in the fall.\n\nAfter some careful consideration, the 41 year Klitschko felt 'enough was enough' and he was not swayed by the possibility of earning a huge payday in a final career bout.\n\n\"I had thousands of reasons to agree to a rematch and the same number of reasons to finish my career, but at the time of [making] the decision - a part of me was already dead, I noticed that the motivation was not at that level, even the possible $20 million that I could earn for the rematch with Joshua.. could not change my opinion.

It's happened, for example, with Hall of Fame former heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, who was never really appreciated either during his heyday, but is now revered.\n\nTake it to the bank that years from now when Klitschko's stellar 21-year career is reviewed he will be far more appreciated than he ever was when he was dominating one title challenger after another for nearly a decade.\n\nKlitschko (64-5, 54 KOs) fought in more heavyweight title fights than anybody who has ever lived (29).\n\nLet that sink in for a minute.\n\nHe held the title longer (nine years, seven months and seven days) than any heavyweight who ever lived that was not named Joe Louis. He made more consecutive title defenses (18) than any heavyweight who ever lived that was not named Joe Louis (25) or Larry Holmes (20). He unified three of the major belts, and the main reason he never held the fourth was because his older brother Vitali Klitschko held it for several years and they are best friends who had, understandably, promised their mother they would never fight each other.\n\nYet so many derided Klitschko through the years because he was sometimes more tactical and defensive-minded than aggressive, so his fights were not always that crowd-pleasing. But a lack of exciting fights doesn't mean he wasn't great. Think Floyd Mayweather, but nearly a foot taller and 100 pounds heavier.\n\nDid Klitschko suffer some bad losses? Sure did. No denying that. Knockouts to journeyman Ross Puritty in 1998, Corrie Sanders in 2003 (ending his first title reign) and Lamon Brewster in a vacant title fight in 2004 are certainly marks against him. But the totality of his career must be considered as well as how he responded to the defeats, especially to Brewster (a loss later avenged in one-sided fashion).\n\nAfter that loss, Klitschko was left for dead by almost everybody. He had doubts in himself as well. He had won a 1996 Olympic gold medal and a world title and now, here he was, with the world kicking dirt on his career at age 28.\n\nBut, with the help of the late, great trainer Emanuel Steward, who had come on board for the first Brewster fight, they rebuilt his career, and not just into a good one, but an all-time great one in which he wound up going 25-4 with 19 knockouts overall in world title fights.\n\nDuring his great second title reign not only did Klitschko dominate everyone, he rarely even lost rounds. After that loss to Brewster in 2004, Klitschko didn't lose again until Tyson Fury outpointed him a massive upset in 2015, followed by his swan song against Joshua 17 months later.\n\nFrom 2004 to 2015, when he won 22 fights in a row and unified three world titles, is where Klitschko cemented his legacy as an all-time great. Had he been American instead of from Ukraine, he'd have been on cereal boxes.\n\nThe critics like to talk about how Klitschko fought in a weak era of heavyweights. That's true, but most eras of heavyweight boxing have been weak. There are really only two that stand out as great eras: the 1970s era led by Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier and George Foreman. and the 1990s led by Lewis, Evander Holyfield, the second coming of Foreman, Michael Moorer and the long, slow decline of Mike Tyson post-Buster Douglas and prison.\n\nSay whatever you want about the era in which Klitschko fought, but it is no worse than the era of a prime Tyson, who, by the way, made half as many successful title defenses during his first reign as Klitschko did in his second one (18-9). Louis' opposition was referred to derisively as \"the bum of the month club.\"\n\nBut it's not like Klitschko only beat scrubs. He beat a lot of quality opponents such as Samuel Peter (twice), Chris Byrd (twice), David Haye, Alexander Povetkin, Ruslan Chagaev, Sultan Ibragimov, Tony Thompson (twice), Calvin Brock, Kubrat Pulev, Bryant Jennings, Jameel McCline and Ray Mercer. In fact, of his 18 title defenses during his second reign, eight came against undefeated opponents.\n\nSo while Klitschko's defining fight may ultimately be the loss to Joshua because it was so exciting and so dramatic, and because Klitschko showed so much heart, nobody should write off all the good opponents he did beat just because the fights were so one-sided. His talent, ring intelligence and a diverse arsenal that included arguably the best right hand, left jab and left hook in boxing made those fights one-sided.\n\nNot only should Klitschko be appreciated for his ring accomplishments, but also for the kind of person he is. Great fighter in the ring, humanitarian outside of it. He has supported numerous charitable causes, including child-related ones. He carried himself with class despite the intense spotlight. There was never a whiff of legal trouble.\n\nI first met Klitschko and his brother Vitali in 2001 in Las Vegas for an interview on the set of the movie Ocean's Eleven that they appeared in with Wladimir facing Lewis in a mock fight that served as the backdrop for a Las Vegas casino heist. Since then I have interviewed him countless times, covered many of his fights and also had personal conversations and emails with him. I'm not sure if I have ever heard him so much as curse or speak negatively.\n\nHe was a towering figure in boxing and while his career has come to an end - like all good things must - he did the right thing calling it a day. He left on his own terms and won't go on and tarnish his legacy by fighting past his best like so many boxers have.\n\nMany have already given him credit for that decision. Someday they'll give him the rest of the credit he deserves for a long and distinguished career that will come to be appreciated as the years go by.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri":

The post is accompanied by the tag: 'Victims eye view. #goodnight'\n\nAnthony Joshua trainer Jamie Reynolds' has published a video of the Brit's punch on Instagram\n\nVictims eye view  @anthony_joshua #speed #power #goodnight #AJBXNG\n\nA post shared by Jamie Reynolds (@jamie_velocity) on Aug 17, 2017 at 4:06am PDT\n\nAgain, and again, and again, Joshua fires his right fist forward. A terrifying sight, and it's no wonder he holds a 19-0 undefeated run, having recently added 41-year-old Vladamir 'Dr Steelhammer' Klitschko to his list of boxing scalps in May.\n\nThe pair endured one of the most thrilling heavyweight bouts in recent times, with Joshua coming out on top in the 11th round and increasing his record to 19-0.\n\nBut Klitschko, who was recovering from his recent world title defeat by the controversial Irishman Tyson Fury, became the first to knock Joshua down in a professional fight, and has since hung up his gloves for good.\n\nThe former Olympic champion dealt Klitschko a crushing blow in their 11 round epic, and has opened the door again to the Ukranian with the opportunity for a rematch in November\n\nFollowing the Brit's triumphant victory over the Ukranian, Joshua sits at the top of the boxing tree, with many coming forward to challenge him.\n\nPlan A for Joshua, is a rematch with Klitschko in November, who is now officially a former boxer following his retirement, but it's a rematch so many would pay to see.\n\n'The ball is in Klitschko's court,' said Joshua in July. 'I am going to continue my career. It is up to him whether he wants to have a rematch or whether he says,'you know what, that's enough'.\n\n'But I think, whatever he decides to do, we all respect him.'\n\nBut what is plan B?\n\n'Plan B would be look at the option with (Kubrat) Pulev, and where we would fight him and the options available for the Pulev fight.\n\n'So either it will be Klitschko, which would be great, or Pulev, which would be great.

The combination of two charismatic, explosive punchers would appeal both in the UK and the US, but may have such commercial potential that they would choose to delay until next summer. Wilder was ringside at Wembley, but has also been linked to fighting Tony Bellew.\n\nGetty\n\n4/8 Joseph Parker\n\nNew Zealand's WBO champion Parker carries less threat and appeal than Wilder but also represents less of a risk. The 25-year-old had been scheduled to fight Tyson Fury's cousin Hughie until injury ruled the challenger out, and is one of only two fighters against which a unification match-up could be made.\n\nGetty\n\n5/8 Tyson Fury\n\nImmediately after his defeat of Klitschko, Joshua called out the fighter who is quickly becoming his biggest rival. The 28-year-old Fury unsurprisingly responded on Twitter, writing \"challenge accepted\". Both seem confident of victory and willing to fight each other, both have beaten Klitschko and both represent the other's most intriguing opponent within the UK. Fury's biggest challenge could yet come in regaining his boxing licence amid his struggles with depression.\n\nGetty\n\n6/8 Tony Bellew\n\nThe former WBC cruiserweight champion's unexpected defeat of David Haye has given him far more appeal in the heavyweight division than any would have predicted. He seems incapable of providing Joshua with much of a test, but the money involved in fighting the champion will become such that any potential offers will be tempting. A match-up between the two is also straightforward to make, given they are both promoted by Matchroom. The biggest question may be whether Matchroom would rather use the 34-year-old Liverpudlian to further build Wilder's reputation before the American eventually fights Joshua.\n\nGetty\n\n7/8 David Haye\n\nHaye used to hold the heavyweight world title until he lost to Wlaimir Klitschko and subsequently retired in 2011, only to launch a comeback that has never really taken off. He suffered a ruptured Achilles tendon in his defeat by Tony Bellew earlier this year, and while he is not expected to fight again in 2017, he could yet be a future opponent for Joshua.\n\nGetty\n\n8/8 Kubrat Pulev\n\nJoshua could now be forced to face Kubrat Pulev as the IBF mandatory challenger, or else be stripped of one of his three titles.\n\nGetty\n\nHe is regardless willing to risk that development in the hope he can fight Ortiz thereafter, but despite a rematch in Vegas with the retired Wladimir Klitschko once appearing a near-certainty, a domestic fight is his biggest concern.\n\n\"I'm not turning Vegas down, I'd go, but for the people it's easier,\" Joshua, 27, said.\n\n\"My heart always tells me the UK, because a lot of people that have supported me since the amateurs are from here, and it gives them a chance to come down and watch a heavyweight title fight without having to travel.\n\nJoshua could now be forced to face Kubrat Pulev as the IBF mandatory challenger, or else be stripped of one of his three titles. (Getty)\n\n\"I know people will always make the effort but sometimes you want to make it as easy as possible for them.\n\n\"Klitschko's unfortunately retired: it was a fight I was looking forward to again, but everything happens for a reason and now I have to go and compete with one of my mandatory challengers.\n\n\"My mandatory with Pulev has been ongoing for a year. The mandatory with Luis Ortiz has been going on for two months; I've had obligations in place for the past year. (The IBF) let me and Klitschko have a unification fight. We had to sign an agreement that straight after the Klitschko fight (I would fight Pulev), provided there's not a rematch.\"\n\nA general view of the fireworks prior to the RBS Six Nations match between Wales v Ireland at the Principality Stadium (Getty)\n\nShortly after Klitschko announced his retirement the WBA ordered Joshua to defend their title against Ortiz, and the Cuban's manager insisted they could be ready for November 11.\n\nThey could yet strip Joshua amid him persisting with the Pulev match-up, but Joshua hopes to retain both of his titles and is willing to then face the dangerous southpaw.\n\n\"I'd fight Ortiz next if he was the next person in line before Pulev,\" he said. \"My team, we sit down and talk, figure out what's best and move forward. I love fighting for the belts; it's history, but what's advised for me and my career in the long term has to be weighed up.\n\nRead more Khan sends apologetic message to Joshua over affair allegations\n\n\"I would definitely fight my two mandatories because they're exciting: it's just if one's patient or wants the belts now. People just say they want to fight me: they don't really want to fight me, just the rewards that come with fighting me. They'll get their turn.\n\n\"As long as (boxing's political landscape) doesn't stop me from fighting. The rules and regulations have to be in place to make it interesting: no problem. If that's the case, if I have to get stripped, no problem at all.\"\n\nMore about: Anthony Joshua Reuse content", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id":

Marquez started his career in May 1993 with a disqualification loss and fought his last in May 2014 with a unanimous decision victory over Mike Alvarado for a career spanning 21 years.\n\nCoincidentally, Klitschko had a similar tenure on top of the ring as he fought and won his first pro fight in 1996 and ended it on that stoppage loss to Anthony Joshua in April of this year for a similar period of 21 years.\n\nAdvantage: Even\n\nRECORD. With more career wins, lesser number of losses and a higher knockout ratio (77% to 63%) \"Dr Steelhammer\" wins this category.\n\nAdvantage: Klitschko\n\nQUALITY OF OPPOSITION. This is where \"Dinamita\" lords it over his heavyweight rival.\n\nMarquez fought and defeated some of the best in the sport: Orlando Salido, Marco Antonio Barrera, Joel Casamayor, Juan Diaz. And of course who can forget his knockout of Pacquiao.\n\nIn contrast, although Klitschko defeated the likes of Chris Byrd, Samuel Peter and Hasim Rahman, he lost fights to mid-caliber heavyweights like Ross Purity, Corrie Sanders and Lamont Brewster. His losses to Tyson Fury and Anthony Joshua also weigh-in against him.\n\nAdvantage: Marquez.\n\nHOW IT ENDED. Though Klitschko gained more respect in his stoppage loss to Joshua than in his previous wins, a loss is a loss and he ended it on two consecutive ones.\n\nMarquez took it slow in his last few fights, fighting only once in 2013 and 2014 going 1-1. But his seminal knockout of arch-rival Pacquiao also came in his 3rd to the last fight, making him a clear victor in this category.\n\nAdvantage: Marquez\n\nLEGACY. It's tough to compare legacies when you have two fighters from separate weight classes.\n\nBut to me \" Dinamita\" left a more satisfying fistic imprint with his technical approach seamlessly intertwined with speed, power and thunderous combinations.\n\nKlitschko was known for his devastating power early in his career as he enjoyed a size and strength advantage over his opponents.\n\nBut after suffering knockout losses, he transformed into a fighter with a safety-first approach and though this enabled him to stretch his reign, this shrouds his legacy, notwithstanding his valiant effort in his last fight against Joshua.\n\nAdvantage: Marquez\n\nLAST ROUNDS.

We had to try.\"\n\nHe explained that the clinkering process requires heat and the right combination of oxides, all of which are in used cement, but need to be reactivated.\n\nThe research team tested a variety of slags, made from demolition waste and added lime, alumina and silica.\n\nThe slags were processed in the Materials Processing Institute's EAF with molten steel and rapidly cooled.\n\nDr. Dunant said: \"We found the combination of cement clinker and iron oxide is an excellent steelmaking slag because it foams and it flows well.\n\n\"And if you get the balance right and cool the slag quickly enough, you end up with reactivated cement, without adding any cost to the steelmaking process.\"\n\nThe cement made through the recycling process contains higher levels of iron oxide than conventional cement, but the research team says that has little effect on performance.\n\nThe Cambridge Electric Cement process has been scaling rapidly, and the researchers say it could be producing one billion tonnes per year by 2050, which represents around 25per cent of current annual cement production.\n\nAllwood said: \"Producing zero emissions cement is an absolute miracle, but we've also got to reduce the amount of cement and concrete we use.\n\n\"Concrete is cheap, strong and can be made almost anywhere, but we just use far too much of it.\n\n\"We could dramatically reduce the amount of concrete we use without any reduction in safety, but there needs to be political will to make that happen.\"\n\nHe added: \"As well as being a breakthrough for the construction industry, we hope that Cambridge Electric Cement will also be a flag to help the government recognize that the opportunities for innovation on our journey to zero emissions extend far beyond the energy sector.\"\n\nThe

We had to try.\"\n\nHe explained that the clinkering process requires heat and the right combination of oxides, all of which are in used cement, but need to be reactivated.\n\nThe research team tested a variety of slags, made from demolition waste and added lime, alumina and silica.\n\nThe slags were processed in the Materials Processing Institute's EAF with molten steel and rapidly cooled.\n\nDr. Dunant said: \"We found the combination of cement clinker and iron oxide is an excellent steelmaking slag because it foams and it flows well.\n\n\"And if you get the balance right and cool the slag quickly enough, you end up with reactivated cement, without adding any cost to the steelmaking process.\"\n\nThe cement made through the recycling process contains higher levels of iron oxide than conventional cement, but the research team says that has little effect on performance.\n\nThe Cambridge Electric Cement process has been scaling rapidly, and the researchers say it could be producing one billion tonnes per year by 2050, which represents around 25per cent of current annual cement production.\n\nAllwood said: \"Producing zero emissions cement is an absolute miracle, but we've also got to reduce the amount of cement and concrete we use.\n\n\"Concrete is cheap, strong and can be made almost anywhere, but we just use far too much of it.\n\n\"We could dramatically reduce the amount

The slags were processed in the Materials Processing Institute's EAF with molten steel and rapidly cooled.\n\n\"We found the combination of cement clinker and iron oxide is an excellent steelmaking slag because it foams and it flows well,\" said Dunant. \"And if you get the balance right and cool the slag quickly enough, you end up with reactivated cement, without adding any cost to the steelmaking process.\"\n\nThe cement made through this recycling process contains higher levels of iron oxide than conventional cement, but the researchers say this has little effect on performance.\n\nThe Cambridge Electric Cement process has been scaling rapidly, and the researchers say they could be producing one billion tonnes per year by 2050, which represents roughly a quarter of current annual cement production.\n\n\"Producing zero emissions cement is an absolute miracle, but we've also got to reduce the amount of cement and concrete we use,\" said Allwood. \"Concrete is cheap, strong and can be made almost anywhere, but we just use far too much of it. We could dramatically reduce the amount of concrete we use without any reduction in safety, but there needs to be political will to make that happen.\n\n\"As well as being a breakthrough for the construction industry, we hope that Cambridge Electric Cement will also be a flag to help the government recognise that the opportunities for innovation on our journey to zero emissions extend far beyond the energy sector.\"\n\nThe researchers have filed a patent on the process to support its commercialisation. The research was supported in part by Innovate UK and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).\n\n/Public Release.

Researchers say that if they switched to electric-powered furnaces, and used renewable energy like wind and solar rather than fossil fuels, that could mean no greenhouse gases would be released at all.\n\nAnd that would be a big deal. Cement forms the foundation of the modern economy, both literally and metaphorically.\n\nIt is what binds the sand and aggregate in concrete together, and concrete is the most widely used material on the planet after water.\n\nIt is also a major driver of climate change. If cement was a country, it would be the third biggest source of emissions after China and the US, responsible for 7.5% of human-made CO2.\n\nThe problem is the material's uniquely polluting chemistry.\n\nIt is made by heating limestone to up 1600 Celsius in giant kilns powered by fossil fuels.\n\nThose emissions are just the start. The heat is used to drive carbon dioxide from the limestone molecules, leaving a residue of cement.\n\nAdd both these sources of pollution together and it is estimated that about a tonne of carbon dioxide is produced for every tonne of cement.\n\nThe team of scientists, from Cambridge University, has found a neat way to sidestep those emissions.\n\nIt exploits the fact that you can reactivate used cement by exposing it to high temperatures again.\n\nThe chemistry is well-established, and it has been done at scale in cement kilns.\n\nThe breakthrough is to prove it can be done by piggybacking on the heat generated by another heavy industry - steel recycling.\n\nWhen you recycle steel, you add chemicals that float on the surface of the molten metal to prevent it reacting with the air and creating impurities. This is known as slag.\n\nThe Cambridge team spotted the composition of used cement is almost exactly the same as the slag used in electric arc furnaces.\n\nThey have been trialling the process at a small-scale electric arc furnace at the Materials Processing Institute in Middlesborough.\n\nThe BBC was present when the first high grade, or \"Portland\", cement was produced.\n\nThey are calling it \"electric cement\" and described the event as a world first.\n\nThe lead scientist, Cyrille Dunant, told the BBC it could enable the production of zero-carbon cement.\n\n\"We have shown the high temperatures in the furnace reactivate the old cement and because electric arc furnaces use electricity they can be powered by renewable power, so the entire cement making process is decarbonised.,\" he said.\n\nHe said it also makes steel recycling less polluting because making the chemicals currently used as slag has a high carbon cost too.\n\nMark Miodownik, Professor of Materials and Society at University College London, described the way the Cambridge team have combined cement and steel recycling as \"genius\" and believes, if it can be made to work profitably at scale, it could lead to huge reductions in emissions.\n\n\"Can it compete against the existing infrastructure that is very unsustainably going to keep pumping cement into our lives\", he asks.\n\n\"Cement is already a billion-dollar industry. It's David and Goliath we are talking about here.\"\n\nThe hope is electric cement will be cheaper to manufacture because it uses what is essentially waste heat from the steel recycling process.\n\nSpanish company Celsa will attempt to replicate the process in its full-scale electric arc furnace in Cardiff this week.\n\nThe Cambridge team estimate, given current rates of steel recycling, their low carbon cement could produce as much as a quarter of UK demand.\n\nBut the use of electric arc furnaces is expected to increase in the future, potentially allowing more \"electric cement\" to be produced.\n\nAnd, of course, the process could be duplicated all over the world, potentially cutting the emissions from cement dramatically.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com",

I think it's going to have a huge impact,\" said Allwood, an expert on industrial emissions and key contributor to reports from the UN's scientific panel on climate change.\n\nTo produce cement, the basic ingredient in concrete, limestone must be fired in kilns at very high temperatures usually achieved by burning fossil fuels like coal.\n\nOn top of that, limestone produces significant additional CO2 when heated.\n\n'Bright hope'\n\nThe cement industry alone accounts for nearly eight percent of human-caused CO2 emissions -- more than any country except China and the United States.\n\nSome 14 billion cubic metres of concrete are cast every year, according to industry figures, and more still will be needed as economies and cities grow in future.\n\nThe International Energy Agency says that if emissions from the cement industry continue to increase, a pledge of carbon neutrality by 2050 will almost certainly remain out of reach.\n\nMany efforts to produce low-carbon or so-called \"green cement\" are too expensive or difficult to deploy at scale, rely on unproven technologies, or don't come near zero emissions.\n\nThe Cambridge researchers approached the problem by looking at an industry that was already well established -- steel recycling, which uses electric-powered furnaces to produce the alloy.\n\nThey substituted a key ingredient in that process with old cement sourced from demolished buildings, Allwood said.\n\nInstead of waste being produced, the end result was recycled cement ready for use in concrete, bypassing the emissions-heavy process of superheating limestone in kilns.\n\nThis method -- which has a patent pending -- was \"a very low disruption innovation\" requiring little change or additional cost on the part of business, Allwood said.\n\nIf powered by renewable energy, he said, these furnaces could hope to produce zero-emission concrete at scale.\n\n\"Once the electricity has no emissions, then our process would have no emissions,\" Allwood said.\n\nCountries could not hope to bring CO2 emissions to zero by 2050 -- the key pledge of the Paris climate agreement -- using concrete as it exists today, he added.",

These are cement, the key binding agent in materials such as concrete; and steel, which is widely used for applications ranging from buildings to cars and packaging. The processes used to manufacture these materials require high temperatures and involve chemical conversions that release CO, hindering efforts to reduce emissions. Writing in Nature, Dunant et al. report a process that could help to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from the production of both cement and steel by integrating recycling pathways for the two materials.\n\nThe raw materials used to make cement are mainly composed of limestone (which consists mostly of calcium carbonates) and silica-rich clays. To form the cement, the limestone is calcined -- a process in which the limestone is heated, causing decomposition and the release of CO -- and the resulting materials are sent through a kiln with the clays to produce calcium silicates. Steel production involves the chemical reduction of iron oxides, typically using carbon monoxide formed from coal resources. Lime (calcium oxide) is added to help remove impurities from the steel, and is manufactured from limestone by calcining. Both the chemical reduction and the manufacture of lime also generate CO.\n\nThe CO emissions produced directly by these chemical processes combine with those associated with the high energy demands of steel and cement manufacture -- which are frequently met by burning fossil fuels. Much effort has been directed towards exploring strategies for lowering these emissions. For example, switching to lower-emission energy sources is potentially beneficial for making both cement and steel. Approaches for decarbonizing cement production include changing the composition of the raw materials and partially replacing the component of cement that requires a kiln with low-emissions mineral additives.\n\nSteel-decarbonization strategies have included finding alternative methods to chemically reduce iron oxides, and using electric-arc furnaces (EAFs, which use an electric current to generate an arc that melts materials) rather than higher-emitting blast furnaces. Recycling steel, particularly with EAFs, is also a key method for lowering CO emissions. However, primary steel production (manufacture from raw materials) is currently a priority in many regions, for which blast furnaces are commonly used, and so EAFs have not been as widely available.\n\nUnlike steel reuse, the recycling of cement to reduce CO emissions has not gained a strong foothold. Initial approaches have included reacting cement recovered from concrete waste with CO to produce a material that is used as a low-emissions partial replacement for cement, and simply heating and grinding waste cement to produce a material that can then be reused as cement.\n\nDunant et al. now explore whether steel and cement recycling can be paired up. The authors show that lime can be partly replaced with previously used cement in the production of recycled steel in EAFs (Fig. 1). This reduces the amount of lime needed, thereby lowering CO emissions. Moreover, the 'slag' co-product formed from reactions of the lime in this steel-recycling process has a similar composition to primary (non-recycled) cement, and therefore can be used as a replacement for primary cement -- although the authors note that modifications to the composition of the slag, such as the addition of lime, are sometimes needed.\n\nIn effect, Dunant and colleagues have demonstrated a process for the electric co-production of recycled cement and steel. This could reduce the CO emissions associated with the use of limestone in both cement and steel production -- thus negating a substantial fraction of the emissions produced by chemical reactions, and lowering the consumption of primary resources.\n\nHowever, this method alone will not eliminate the emissions from cement production, for various reasons. The amount of slag generated from making steel and iron is insufficient to meet current demand for cement -- around 400 million tonnes of slag is estimated to be produced globally each year (see go.nature.com/44ls0zc), whereas more than ten times that amount of cement is produced annually (see go.nature.com/4bhumqc), exceeding 4 billion tonnes. Moreover, blast furnaces currently dominate global steel-making, producing the majority of slag, and are especially common in areas that have limited steel recycling. Given that many of these furnaces are new, they will probably be in place for at least another 20 years, limiting the incentive to install EAFs.\n\nIn fact, blast-furnace slag is already commonly used as a partial replacement for cement. By contrast, EAF slag has historically been less useful as a cement replacement and is generated in much smaller quantities (around 20% of the amount of blast-furnace slag). So although Dunant and colleagues' process could improve the environmental sustainability of global cement production by increasing recycling, and replace currently underused EAF slag with a more useful product, its reliance on less-widespread furnaces potentially limits the amount of cement that is recycled.\n\nOther factors compound the issue further. For example, the availability of slag equates to only about 10% of new cement production and used cement to only 30%. The amount of scrap steel that could be used in EAFs is limited, and varies locally: regions that have been using steel for long periods of time have more of it (see go.nature.com/3juvkor). Furthermore, cement is not being taken out of use, and hence becoming available to recycle, in locations where cement demand is highest -- although it could be taken out at rates that enable a notable fraction of the demand to be satisfied by reused material in some regions that need less cement. The authors' process alone is therefore unlikely to balance the supply of recycled cement with demand for fresh. Transportation of supplies between areas would not solve the problem, because it could further increase CO emissions.\n\nFinally, although limestone processing is the primary driver of cement-production emissions, it accounts for only just over 10% of direct CO emissions from global steel production. Multiple strategies for reducing emissions from cement production, beyond recycling cement in EAFs, must therefore be implemented simultaneously to decarbonize both industries. This will require accurate methods to quantify the emissions associated with co-processing of cement and steel, to allocate the emissions to the respective industries and then to assign a carbon budget to each industry. Nevertheless, Dunant and colleagues' process could be a valuable component in a suite of options for achieving net-zero emissions.\n\nEstablishing a pathway to cement recycling has not been easy in the past. The authors' findings not only suggest a way forward, but also raise the prospect of forging a means for co-production between two of the industries that generate the highest global CO emissions. Efforts such as these to extract the most value from resources -- scaled up for mass production and tailored to local needs -- combined with strategies for reducing associated environmental impacts, will be key to decarbonizing society.", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slag", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_(material)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lime (material)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_furnace", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blast furnace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steelmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Limestone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carbon monoxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Calcination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiln", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kiln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_oxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iron oxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Redox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium_silicate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calcium silicate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binder_(material)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Binder (material)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human impact on the environment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Nanomaterials", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Nanomaterials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Cleaning", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Cleaning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Catalysts_and_Adsorbents", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Catalysts and Adsorbents", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Carbon", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Carbon", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-024-01359-z/d41586-024-01359-z_27110144.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590224", "eventUri": "eng-9590224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Lime flux, which removes impurities in the steel, would normally end up as a waste product. But in replacing it with used cement, the cement is also recycled and can be used to make new concrete.\n\nConcrete is a mixture of four things - cement, sand, stones and water.\n\nProfessor Julian Allwood from Cambridge's Department of Engineering, who led the research, told The National: \"Cement is the active ingredient and the one that's associated with all the emissions.\"\n\nThat is because it is made through a process called clinkering, where limestone and other raw materials are crushed and heated to about 1,450\u00b0C in large kilns.\n\n\"That's such a high temperature that you essentially have to reach it by burning fossil fuels. So combustion emissions is about half of the emissions,\" said Prof Allwood.\n\n\"But the other is the chemistry of converting limestone into cement automatically releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That is the other half of the emissions.\n\n\"So the cement has already given up its Co2. There is no new chemical reaction required. In effect what we are doing is reactivating the cement.\"\n\nHe said his team were motivated to seek a solution to the problem because although there are some options for making cement with less emissions, there are none for making the material with zero emissions.\n\n\"And yet the UK, and many other countries, rightly, are committed to zero emissions in the relatively near future.\n\n\"Without it means no cement and building with other very limited options,\" he added.\n\nTests carried out by the Materials Processing Institute, a partner in the project, showed that recycled cement can be produced at scale using an electric arc furnace.\n\nBut the researchers say it could produce zero emission cement, if the electric arc furnace is powered by renewable energy.\n\n\"The important thing is that for the first time there is a route to getting to zero emissions cement. Our estimate of the maximum volume we could make is based on the fact that we know the world's steel recycling industry will double in size, at least, in the next 30 years,\" said Prof Allwood.\n\n\"Because the supply of scrap steel has gone up. If we assume that all of them use our process, we could maybe get up to a quarter of today's supply of cement.\"\n\nYou could look at that in two ways, he said.\n\n\"One is to say oh where is the other three quarters going to come from? But the better way to look at it is all the rest of it is going to have to stop because of our commitment to getting to zero emissions. At least we now have an option for having some cement,\" added Prof Allwood.\n\nEarlier this month, it was revealed that researchers aim to harness heat generated by the sun to manufacture building materials such as glass, steel, ceramics and cement, showing that generating heat of 1,000\u00b0C heat is possible without using fossil fuels.\n\nThey have found a way to improve the efficiency of solar receivers, which concentrate and build heat with thousands of sun-tracking mirrors.\n\nResearchers led by a team in Switzerland used quartz to trap sunlight, in a process known as the thermal-trap effect, proving a receiver with a normal efficiency of 40 per cent at 1,200\u00b0C that uses a concentration of light from 500 suns can hit 70 per cent efficiency when shielded with 300mm of quartz. To obtain that performance would normally require the light from 1,000 suns.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gillian_duncan@thenationalnews.com", "name": "Gillian Duncan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_(material)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lime (material)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc_furnace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric arc furnace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limestone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Construction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiln", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kiln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemical reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Building material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/GLIJCHK6Q4HO7DADLDKNRGQWGA.jpg?smart=true&auth=b99966c9a3434afc38dd80a0bbe3ffb93e037b552afd7b5e6f324626d0426a2a&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590224", "eventUri": "eng-9590224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

This makes it a significant polluter, even when compared to other industries known for their high emissions, such as iron and steel or oil and gas manufacturing.(Image/LinkedIn)\n\nThe cement industry contributes majorly to global greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for at least 8% of the total. This makes it a significant polluter, even when compared to other industries known for their high emissions, such as iron and steel or oil and gas manufacturing.\n\nThe construction of modern buildings and urban infrastructure consumes vast amounts of raw materials globally. Cement and concrete production, in particular, accounts for roughly 8% of the carbon dioxide (CO) emissions generated by human activities worldwide. This significant environmental impact calls for rapid development, and widespread use, of concrete with a lower carbon footprint in the construction industry.\n\nAs the world population grows, cities are expanding and living standards are improving, with the global demand for concrete products increasing at an ever-faster pace. The use of concrete has skyrocketed over the past three decades due to its versatility, affordability and the long-lasting nature of concrete buildings and structures. Globally, we use about 30 billion tons of concrete every year -- a 300% increase compared to just 40 years ago. The demand for concrete now far exceeds demand for other construction materials, such steel or wood.\n\nPer Capita Cement Consumption\n\nIndia's per capita cement consumption is significantly lower than the global average, at between 250 kg and 270 kg per person, compared to 500kg and 550 kg per person globally. China, on the other hand, leads the world in per capita cement consumption, in the range of 1,750 kg-1,850 kg per person, ahead of Korea which has a per capita consumption of 850 kg.\n\nIndia's cement production currently sits at 370 million metric tons, (approx 0.4 billion tons), while China produces a much larger amount of 2,100 million metric tons, according to Statista. Crisil ratings predict that India's cement industry will increase its production capacity by 80 million tons by FY 2024. In terms of actual consumption, India used 355.46 million tons of cement in FY 2022. This is projected to rise to 450 million tons by end-FY 2027.\n\nProcedure for Making Concrete\n\nTo make concrete, one starts by mixing sand, gravel, cement and water. This mixture is then poured into molds where it hardens into the final structure. However, producing the cement, itself, involves a complex process. It begins with such raw materials as limestone and clay, which are crushed and then subjected to extremely high temperatures (over 1,400\u00b0C) in a special furnace, or kiln. The intense heat is typically generated by burning fossil fuels, and this, unfortunately, leads to significant pollution.\n\nAs these materials are heated, they undergo a series of chemical reactions that transform them into a substance, called 'clinker'. Clinker consists of small, hard, spherical particles. Once it cools, the clinker is ground down to a fine powder and mixed with gypsum and other additives to create cement. This cement is the crucial binding agent used in concrete, providing the necessary durability and strength for construction projects.\n\nAdditionally, a significant chemical reaction takes place during the formation of clinker. Limestone, or calcium carbonate (CaCO), is transformed into calcium silicate (CaSiO). This reaction is not only crucial for producing clinker, but also releases about 600 kilograms of CO for every ton of cement produced, contributing to environmental concerns. Clinker is indispensable in cement, acting as the key adhesive that ensures concrete's structural integrity and strength.\n\nTo reduce the environmental impact of concrete production, cement manufacturers have joined forces with researchers and engineers. They are exploring ways to use less clinker in cement, which is the main source of CO emissions. This involves replacing some of the clinker with alternative materials, called supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs).\n\nThese SCMs include byproducts from other industries, such as fly ash and blast furnace slag. Using these materials can help lessen the overall environmental impact of cement production. But the main challenge in using SCMs in concrete is that they lack the strong binding properties of clinker. As a result, concrete made with low-clinker cement often falls short in terms of performance for many applications.\n\nBolstering Strength of Cement\n\nA spin-off from the University of Exeter and University of Manchester's Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre, Concrene Limited, in recent years, has achieved a breakthrough and discovered a way to add graphene to concrete. This innovation enhances the material's strength and its ability to resist water. Even more significantly, this graphene addition allows for a reduction in the cement content of concrete by as much as 50%, even eliminating the need for steel reinforcement.\n\nWhat is Graphene?\n\nImagine a sheet of paper so thin that it is only one atom thick! That is grapheme -- a super-strong material made entirely of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Think of it like a giant sheet of graphite, the stuff in your pencil, but stretched out to be incredibly thin and strong\n\nGraphene is incredibly light, but intensely powerful. It is an amazing conductor of electricity and heat and is stronger than steel by a factor of 200! Besides, it is flexible, meaning it can bend and move without breaking. These incredible properties make graphene a promising material for many exciting applications\n\nGraphene to Solve Clinker Issue?\n\nEver since graphene was discovered, scientists have been busy exploring how adding it to cement can improve the properties of concrete. Back in 2014, University of Exeter researchers had a big \"Aha!\" moment. They figured out how to mix tiny bits of graphene with water -- a tricky thing to do because graphene usually does not like water. This was a big deal because it opened the doors to using graphene in concrete!\n\nThink of it like trying to mix oil and water -- they do not usually get along. But, by finding a way to make graphene happy in water, scientists could then add it to cement, creating a new kind of concrete with super-strength and other amazing properties. Exeter scientists did a test where they added a tiny amount of graphene (just 0.03%) to concrete.\n\nThe results were amazing! The concrete became much stronger -- both in terms of how much weight it could hold (compressive strength) and how well it could bend without breaking (flexural strength). It is like adding a little bit of magic dust to your concrete! Even a tiny amount of graphene made a big difference to concrete's strength.\n\nPooram Srikanth, managing partner and technical head of Bangalore-based company Pooram & Pooram, who has vast experience in the field of tribology and has formulated innumerable export-substitutes, achieved a breakthrough in the Indian construction industry by successfully incorporating graphene into concrete, says, \"Graphene-reinforced concrete has been tested at numerous ready-mix concrete (RMC) plants across India under various climatic conditions. There's potential for graphene in EV batteries manufacture and a host of other industries. Our company can now manufacture graphene in bulk. We've recently been awarded a patent for our lead-free X-ray block tiles.\"\n\nThe author of this article is a Defence, Aerospace & Political Analyst based in Bengaluru.", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement_clinker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cement clinker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Environmental issues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon monoxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World population"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limestone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Exeter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Exeter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Manchester", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Manchester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exeter"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Exeter"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Materials_and_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Materials and Supplies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Materials", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Materials", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Environmental", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Environmental", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/edited-cement-industry-linkedin.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590224", "eventUri": "eng-9590224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Both the heat requirements and the chemical reactions involved in making clinker result in carbon emissions, and clinker production accounts for 90 per cent of cement's total carbon footprint.\n\nAllwood and his colleagues have developed an alternative process to make clinker, which involves reusing cement paste from demolished buildings. This paste has an identical chemical composition to lime flux, a substance used to remove impurities from recycled steel.\n\nAs the steel melts, the flux made from old cement forms a slag that floats on the top of the recycled steel. Once ground into a powder, the slag is identical to clinker. It can then be used to make Portland cement, the most common form of cement.\n\nIf the recycled steel and cement are produced using an electric furnace, powered by renewable or nuclear energy, the process is almost entirely free of emissions. \"The idea is really simple,\" says Allwood.\n\nLaboratory trials have proved the process works. It offers a \"drop in\" solution that could be used with conventional equipment, and a global switch to this process could save up to 3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide a year, the team calculates.\n\nThe research team is now working on industrial trials via a spin-out company, Cambridge Electric Cement, with partners such as construction firms Balfour Beatty and Tarmac. \"Within the next few weeks, we are starting a set of trials which will be producing batches of 30 tonnes per hour,\" says Allwood.\n\nScaling up the new cement-making process depends in part on the growth of recycled steel-making, which currently accounts for about 40 per cent of global steel production. Allwood says production rates will at least double over the next 30 years, and most likely treble, as the industry decarbonises.\n\nYet some challenges lie ahead. The recycled cement process requires furnace temperatures of 1600 to 1750\u00b0C (2900 to 3200\u00b0F), slightly hotter than traditional cement production. This will increase power costs, says Leon Black at the University of Leeds, UK.\n\nOther hurdles include establishing supply chains for waste cement, attracting the necessary capital investment and convincing a notoriously cautious industry to adopt a new process on a large scale.\n\n\"They have overcome one barrier in as much as they have made a material that has the same composition as Portland cement,\" says Black. \"The devil is in the details: the energy requirements, the logistics, the scaling up.\"", "source": {"uri": "newscientist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Scientist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement_clinker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cement clinker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_(metallurgy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flux (metallurgy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slag", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limestone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raw_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raw material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chemical reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portland cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_(material)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lime (material)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc_furnace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric arc furnace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_furnace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Industrial furnace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarmacadam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tarmacadam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Beatty", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balfour Beatty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leeds", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Leeds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Nanomaterials", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Nanomaterials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Cleaning", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Cleaning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Catalysts_and_Adsorbents", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Catalysts and Adsorbents", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://images.newscientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/21164515/SEI_205384103.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590224", "eventUri": "eng-9590224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

I think it's going to have a huge impact,\" said Allwood, an expert on industrial emissions and key contributor to reports from the UN's scientific panel on climate change.\n\nTo produce cement, the basic ingredient in concrete, limestone must be fired in kilns at very high temperatures usually achieved by burning fossil fuels like coal.\n\nOn top of that, limestone produces significant additional CO2 when heated.\n\n- 'Bright hope' -\n\nThe cement industry alone accounts for nearly eight percent of human-caused CO2 emissions -- more than any country except China and the United States.\n\nSome 14 billion cubic metres of concrete are cast every year, according to industry figures, and more still will be needed as economies and cities grow in future.\n\nThe International Energy Agency says that if emissions from the cement industry continue to increase, a pledge of carbon neutrality by 2050 will almost certainly remain out of reach.\n\nMany efforts to produce low-carbon or so-called \"green cement\" are too expensive or difficult to deploy at scale, rely on unproven technologies, or don't come near zero emissions.\n\nThe Cambridge researchers approached the problem by looking at an industry that was already well established -- steel recycling, which uses electric-powered furnaces to produce the alloy.\n\nThey substituted a key ingredient in that process with old cement sourced from demolished buildings, Allwood said.\n\nInstead of waste being produced, the end result was recycled cement ready for use in concrete, bypassing the emissions-heavy process of superheating limestone in kilns.\n\nThis method -- which has a patent pending -- was \"a very low disruption innovation\" requiring little change or additional cost on the part of business, Allwood said.\n\nIf powered by renewable energy, he said, these furnaces could hope to produce zero-emission concrete at scale.\n\n\"Once the electricity has no emissions, then our process would have no emissions,\" Allwood said.\n\nCountries could not hope to bring CO2 emissions to zero by 2050 -- the key pledge of the Paris climate agreement -- using concrete as it exists today, he added.",

Current decarbonation strategies include substituting Portland clinker with supplementary materials, but these mainly arise in emitting processes, developing alternative binders but none yet promises scale, or adopting carbon capture and storage that still releases some emissions4,5,6,7,8. However, used cement is potentially an abundant, decarbonated feedstock. Here we show that recovered cement paste can be reclinkered if used as a partial substitute for the lime-dolomite flux used in steel recycling nowadays. The resulting slag can meet existing specifications for Portland clinker and can be blended effectively with calcined clay and limestone. The process is sensitive to the silica content of the recovered cement paste, and silica and alumina that may come from the scrap, but this can be adjusted easily. We show that the proposed process may be economically competitive, and if powered by emissions-free electricity, can lead to zero emissions cement while also reducing the emissions of steel recycling by reducing lime flux requirements. The global supply of scrap steel for recycling may treble by 2050, and it is likely that more slag can be made per unit of steel recycled. With material efficiency in construction9,10, future global cement requirements could be met by this route.\n\nConcrete is the most used material on the planet, after water, and is responsible for approximately 7.5% of total anthropogenic CO emissions.\n\nThe two main strategies deployed to date to reduce emissions from Portland cement production are fuel switching (using fossil gas, municipal waste or biofuels instead of coke and petcoke) and increased use of substitution materials, such as fly ash and slag. However, these strategies cannot lead to zero emissions. Moreover, the two most common substitution materials, ground-granulated blast furnace slag and fly ash are themselves by-products of primary steel production and coal power stations, both of which are highly emitting and therefore must be phased out in the transition to zero emissions. There has been a recent surge of interest in ternary blends with calcined clay and limestone (commonly known as LC). Nevertheless, it could be difficult to achieve substitution levels greater than 50% as these blends still require Portland clinker for activation. Meanwhile, alternative clinkers or binder systems to replace Portland clinker are under development, but none so far can be made at scale without significant emissions. Carbon capture and storage could potentially be applied to cement making but current projects attempt the capture of the process emissions only, without storage.\n\nMost emissions associated with concrete arise in the production of Portland cement, about 40% from fuel combustion and about 60% from limestone decarbonation. Both sources are hard to abate. High-temperature processes are not easily electrified, no alternative cement chemistry can be produced at a comparable scale and no natural source of un-carbonated calcium is available in the required quantities.\n\nA widely deployed high-temperature electric process is the electric-arc furnace (EAF) used for recycling steel. This recycling occurs in two stages. First, scrap is melted and oxidized to remove dirt, carbon and phosphorus. Then, in a ladle furnace, sulfur is removed, and the steel is alloyed. In both steps, a flux is introduced to protect the steel from air, provide the required basicity, protect the lining and the graphite electrodes and increase energy efficiency. This flux is made from limestone-dolomite in a decarbonation process with the same process emissions as Portland cement.\n\nA widely available high-volume source of decarbonated calcium is found in the hydrated cement paste embedded in used concrete. It has been known for a long time that it is possible, in principle, to reclinker hydrated cement paste (HCP). However, there are several challenges to applying this process in a conventional kiln when a large fraction of hydrated cement paste is used. The presence of sulfates (added as set retardant during production) increases the belite content of the reclinkered cement at the expense of highly reactive alite. Furthermore, sulfates are volatile and will condense in cooler parts of the kiln system, causing operational difficulties. Nonetheless, there exist commercial offerings of cement made with partly replaced raw meal (such as Holcim GeoCycle). Separately, cement recovered from used concrete can contain a high fraction of chlorides that, if retained, would exclude the use of reclinkered cement in reinforced applications.\n\nRecovered cement paste (RCP) is not commercially available at scale at present. Separating paste from the aggregates in concrete has been a niche but active area of research and development, driven not by the prospect of using the cement paste but by the possibility of recovering high-quality aggregates that have much higher commercial value than those produced from crushing concrete demolition waste. The value of the improved recovered aggregates is not at present high enough to cover the extra cost of processing, so RCP is currently landfilled. However, the know-how and the technologies required to produce RCP at scale exist. Recently, interest in RCP has grown because of interest in using it in a carbon mineralization process, and start-up companies have been launched to sell specialist grinding equipment. Thus, a nascent market for RCP now exists.\n\nHere we report an innovation that arises from the combination of the above observations: electric cement recycling at scale. In the process shown in Fig. 3e, and described in the patent application for Cambridge Electric Cement (CEC), the emitting lime flux used in steel recycling is replaced by recovered cement paste that has already been decarbonated so will release no further process emissions, although it may require small adjustment with lime. The paste is reclinkered as it is fluxed into a slag. The higher temperature of the EAF (compared with cement kilns) both maintains as gas the sulfates and chlorides that held back earlier reclinkering trials and favours the production of alite over belite. The slag is cooled and ground to produce a conventional Portland clinker in an all-electric process, which, with a decarbonized grid, has neither process nor combustion emissions. This approach will in parallel reduce the emissions of steel recycling by reducing the need for flux production. Both steel recycling slags can be made cementitious by this approach, with the ladle slags being closer to cement composition. However, in this paper, we focus on the EAF (oxidizing) slags as their volume is larger.\n\nIn the context of steel recycling, fluxes are the minerals added to the steel and slag is the resulting viscous layer floating on top of the molten steel. In this paper, we aim to demonstrate that with the right composition of flux based on hydrated or recovered cement paste, the slag, when cooled rapidly, becomes clinker, the artificial mineral that, after grinding and blending, can be made into cement.\n\nTo evaluate the proposed new process route, 28 slags were produced from flux derived from cement paste both prepared for this purpose and recovered from demolition waste. Lime, alumina and silica were added to the fluxes. The composition of a selection of these slags is given in Table 1, with the full set specified in the Supplementary Information. The slags were processed in induction furnaces over clean steel with various crucibles and oxidizing conditions. In an industrial EAF, oxidation and reduction occur in a controlled sequence: these effects are tested separately here. The slags were air-cooled: at this scale, cooling rates of 10-20\u2009K\u2009s at least are achieved, which is fast enough to stabilize alite. The slags were then ground and characterized. Some of the slags with compositions matching conventional clinker listed in Table 2 were blended and used to make mortar bars.\n\nThe diffractograms of selected slags are shown in Fig. 1. The diffractograms of all slags close to from the alite-forming zone (Fig. 1a, yellow) have the main peaks of cementitious phases typical of Portland cement: alite (CS), belite (CS) as well as CAF, and tricalcium aluminate (CA). In general, the phases present are those predicted in the thermodynamic CaO-SiO-AlO-FeO system (Fig. 1a). Rietvield refinement indicates that alite and belite together account for more than 70% of the products in most of the slags made in the zone in which commercial cement kilns operate (indicated by the narrow yellow region in Fig. 1a in which AlO is below 6%). For reference, Portland cement should normatively contain 66.7% by mass of alite and belite. Using this criterion, our process route can make Portland clinkers over a fairly wide zone. In the belite-forming zone (Fig. 1a, orange region), ghelenite is also sometimes observed. Ghelenite (CAS) is the dominant species in the ghelenite zone (Fig. 1a, pink region). The effective lime-to-silica ratio (Methods) is an excellent predictor of the silicate phases that will form (Fig. 1b).\n\nThe X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis of selected slags is provided in Table 1 (for full results, see Supplementary Table 1). The oxide composition of the resulting slags does not differ markedly when using carbon or magnesium crucibles (Supplementary Fig. 1) indicating that over clean steel, there is no significant exchange of species between the slag and the melt. Early experiments performed with an aluminium oxide lining exhibited significant aluminium leaching (Supplementary Fig. 1) and were therefore abandoned. The contamination inherent to steel scrap used in commercial operations would introduce silica and alumina to the slag: the same final compositions would then be reached by adding more lime (CaO) to the flux.\n\nRCP contains a higher proportion of SiO than HCP, almost certainly derived from aggregates still attached to the paste (Fig. 1a). Assuming that feedstock cement has the composition of the CEM I we used as a control, the RCP would contain 52% HCP and 48% impurities. Once corrected by adding lime to have the right balance of calcium and silica (Table 3), it reclinkers as well as pure hydrated paste.\n\nThe metallurgical function of EAF oxidizing slags is to allow the dephosphorization of steel while limiting sulfur in the melt. The slag compositions we tested overlap with those reported in the literature (Fig. 1d) and have the appropriate chemistry. To verify their suitability for EAF operations, slags of typical composition were used, and the resulting steel composition was tested but using a considerably larger flux-to-steel ratio than would be practical in present-day furnace designs (roughly 9:30 compared with 1:30). Despite these unfavourable conditions, only very small amounts of sulfur transferred into the steel (Table 4). In steel-making, following further desulfurization, so far most alloys have a sulfur concentration of less than 0.05% (ref.\u2009), which can be achieved easily from the values reported in Table 4. This confirms that the basic slags produced from the proposed process can be used in EAFs to de-phosphorize steel.\n\nThe cement setting time was measured using calorimetry at 240-280\u2009min (Fig. 2a, \u00b120\u2009min after, the middle point between the dormant period trough and the peak of the silicate hydration peak). Mortars made with the cements were fairly easy to place with small additions of superplasticizer required for the slags made in graphite crucibles (GC80) and for LC mixes. No early setting or flash setting was observed. No bleeding was observed (Fig. 2d, second from the left). On demoulding, the samples were inspected and no defects were found (Fig. 2d, third from the left). All cements, both pure and those blended with calcined clay and limestone, exhibited similar strength development to those made with commercial clinker despite being undersulfated (Supplementary Fig. 2), and containing a fraction of contaminants probably introduced when the crucible was scraped during tapping (Fig. 1c). The relationship between strength development and heat release (Fig. 2a,c) for both our new clinker and a conventional commercial clinker was similar. Higher belite content is associated with lower early strength, whereas higher alite relates to higher early age strength (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). The improved performance of commercial cement (compared with that made from commercial clinker) is because of finer grinding (Fig. 2b). With commercial grinding equipment the clinker produced with the new process is likely to have the same grindability as commercial clinkers (Fig. 2b).\n\nTogether, these results demonstrate the production of Portland cement by reclinkering HCP or RCP on a bed of molten steel. The slags arising from the new flux have the right composition for their metallurgical function. The mineralogy of the output can be tuned as in any conventional kiln, and high-quality clinker can be produced.\n\nFigure 3a confirms the emissions saving from electric cement recycling and anticipates production costs comparable with those of present-day cement that are dominated by the price of fuel and SCMs. All processes are electrified, and both the extra costs and total power requirements of the new process are dominated by heating old concrete before crushing. This is currently required to separate a clean stream of RCP but will be optimized in future. With a decarbonized grid, the only emissions of co-production arise from the small remaining requirement for lime flux, and these would be allocated between the two materials by negotiation. The amount of lime flux required in EAFs depends on the steel scrap feedstock and the furnace design. Clean steel requires less flux to bind residue from the steel, but more to create enough slag to cover the electrodes. All such flux could be replaced with RCP to produce cement. By contrast, although less clean steel requires less flux to cover the electrodes, more is needed to bind with unwanted silica to ensure high slag basicity required for steel quality. In this case, adding RCP to the flux would not reduce lime use but would still produce additional mass of clinker without increasing the emissions of steel recycling. Therefore, Fig. 3a distinguishes the emissions savings from a typical reduction in lime use and those from avoiding conventional cement production. The fact that operating expenses are much greater than capital or labour costs, suggests that the market viability demonstrated here for the UK will translate to other countries.\n\nThe overall supply chain reconfiguration is extensive (compare Fig. 3d,e), but every change can be economically viable. Figure 3d draws on current estimates of mass flows in the UK: steel demand is around 15\u2009Mt\u2009yr, mainly from imports, leading to around 10\u2009Mt\u2009yr of scrap, most of which is currently exported; cement demand is around 13\u2009Mt\u2009yr, requiring clinker production of around 9\u2009Mt\u2009yr (ref.\u2009). Total construction and demolition waste is around 68\u2009Mt\u2009yr (refs.\u2009), most of which is concrete. A conservative estimate is that 4-4.5\u2009Mt of RCP could be produced with a 60% collection rate. The data in Fig. 3e assume that scrap steel volumes approach annual demand to reach 14\u2009Mt\u2009yr and that all UK steel scrap is recycled domestically, following the expansion of EAF capacity. This defines the total capacity for electric cement production. In this study, experiments used 5-30% of the steel mass as the input flux mass. EAFs can operate now with up to 20-30% slag. Although this could be increased, higher values are at present considered undesirable as slag is a waste by-product now, so the figure assumes a slag-to-steel ratio of 1:7, or 14%.", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement_clinker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cement clinker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_(metallurgy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flux (metallurgy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Calcination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slag", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Slag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binder_(material)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Binder (material)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sulfate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Portland cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_ash", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fly ash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human impact on the environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lime_(material)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lime (material)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silicon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc_furnace", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric arc furnace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_aggregate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Construction aggregate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blast_furnace", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blast furnace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carbon capture and storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Cleaning", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Cleaning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-024-07338-8/MediaObjects/41586_2024_7338_Fig1_HTML.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590224", "eventUri": "eng-9590224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Yet, its production process exacts a heavy toll on the environment. Traditional cement manufacturing involves heating limestone to extreme temperatures using fossil fuels, emitting copious amounts of greenhouse gases. In fact, if cement were a nation, its emissions would rank third globally, trailing only China and the United States.\n\nThe solution lies in a pioneering approach pioneered by scientists from Cambridge University. Leveraging the well-established concept of reactivating used cement through high-temperature exposure, the team ingeniously taps into the heat generated by another industrial heavyweight: steel recycling. Remarkably, the composition of used cement mirrors that of slag, a byproduct in electric arc furnaces utilized in steel recycling, presenting a symbiotic opportunity for emissions reduction.\n\nMark Miodownik, Professor of Materials and Society at University College London, hails this integration of cement and steel recycling as \"genius.\" He envisions significant emissions reductions if the process proves economically viable on a large scale, likening it to a David-and-Goliath battle against the entrenched cement industry. The hope is that electric cement, leveraging waste heat from steel recycling, will undercut traditional manufacturing costs.\n\nSpanish company Celsa is poised to validate this groundbreaking technique in a full-scale electric arc furnace located in Cardiff. Initial estimates suggest that, given current rates of steel recycling, low-carbon cement could fulfill up to a quarter of UK demand. However, with the anticipated rise in electric arc furnace usage, the potential for \"electric cement\" production could expand exponentially, offering a glimmer of hope in the fight against climate change.\n\nThe implications extend far beyond the UK, with the possibility of replicating this process worldwide to drastically curtail cement emissions globally. With cement being integral to infrastructure development across the globe, the widespread adoption of this eco-friendly approach could herald a transformative shift towards a more sustainable future.\n\nIn essence, the UK breakthrough promises not only to mitigate the environmental impact of cement production but also to revolutionize the construction industry's approach to sustainability. By harnessing innovation and collaboration across industries, this pioneering endeavor underscores the potential for science to drive tangible solutions to the pressing challenges of our time. As the world grapples with the urgent need to combat climate change, initiatives like these offer a beacon of hope, illustrating the power of ingenuity in reshaping our relationship with the planet.", "source": {"uri": "bbntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bbntimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "azamat_abdoullaev@bbntimes.com", "name": "Azamat Abdoullaev", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_arc_furnace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric arc furnace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_aggregate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Construction aggregate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limestone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waste_heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waste heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Environmental issues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiff", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cardiff"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Cryotechnology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.bbntimes.com/images/articles/society/Revolutionizing_Cement_Production__UK_Breakthrough_Promises_Drastic_Emission_Reductions.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590224", "eventUri": "eng-9590224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Fill in this short form. Help us serve you better!\n\nResearchers on Wednesday said they were a step closer to solving one of the trickiest problems in tackling climate change -- how to keep making cement despite its enormous carbon footprint.\n\nIn a world first, engineers from Britain's University of Cambridge have shown that cement can be recycled without the same steep cost to the environment as making it from scratch.\n\nCement binds concrete together but the whitish powder is highly carbon-intensive to produce, with the sector generating more than triple the emissions of global air travel.\n\nDemand for concrete -- already the most widely used construction material on Earth -- is soaring, but the notoriously polluting industry has struggled to produce it in a less harmful way to the climate.\n\nThe team at Cambridge believes it has a solution, pioneering a method that tweaks an existing process for steel manufacturing to produce recycled cement without the associated CO2 pollution.\n\nThis discovery, published in the journal Nature, could provoke \"an absolutely massive change\" by providing low-cost and low-emission cement at scale, said Julian Allwood, who co-authored the research.\n\n\"It is an extremely exciting project... I think it's going to have a huge impact,\" said Allwood, an expert on industrial emissions and key contributor to reports from the UN's scientific panel on climate change.\n\nTo produce cement, the basic ingredient in concrete, limestone must be fired in kilns at very high temperatures usually achieved by burning fossil fuels like coal.\n\nOn top of that, limestone produces significant additional CO2 when heated.\n\nThe cement industry alone accounts for nearly eight percent of human-caused CO2 emissions -- more than any country except China and the United States.\n\nSome 14 billion cubic metres of concrete are cast every year, according to industry figures, and more still will be needed as economies and cities grow in future.\n\nThe International Energy Agency says that if emissions from the cement industry continue to increase, a pledge of carbon neutrality by 2050 will almost certainly remain out of reach.\n\nMany efforts to produce low-carbon or so-called \"green cement\" are too expensive or difficult to deploy at scale, rely on unproven technologies, or don't come near zero emissions.\n\nThe Cambridge researchers approached the problem by looking at an industry that was already well established -- steel recycling, which uses electric-powered furnaces to produce the alloy.\n\nThey substituted a key ingredient in that process with old cement sourced from demolished buildings, Allwood said.\n\nInstead of waste being produced, the end result was recycled cement ready for use in concrete, bypassing the emissions-heavy process of superheating limestone in kilns.\n\nThis method -- which has a patent pending -- was \"a very low disruption innovation\" requiring little change or additional cost on the part of business, Allwood said.\n\nIf powered by renewable energy, he said, these furnaces could hope to produce zero-emission concrete at scale.\n\n\"Once the electricity has no emissions, then our process would have no emissions,\" Allwood said.\n\nCountries could not hope to bring CO2 emissions to zero by 2050 -- the key pledge of the Paris climate agreement -- using concrete as it exists today, he added.", "source": {"uri": "legit.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legit.ng -

Nova Scotia-based AlterBiota is working to change this.\n\nAlterBiota's innovation is to use a natural hydrous Bio Graphene Oxide (hBGO) admixture to strengthen concrete in place of extra Portland cement. Portland cement is a key component of concrete, and its creation is a highly carbon-intensive process. By minimising the volume of cement needed, manufacturers can drastically reduce the final carbon footprint of their concrete.\n\nThe hBGO is made using byproducts from the forestry industry, allowing the biomass-derived carbon to be permanently locked up in concrete infrastructure. In addition, the hBGO is manufactured in a circular, water-based, \"one-pot-synthesis process\" that leaves virtually no waste. The byproducts of the process include hydrogen, which is used as fuel, and industrial CO2, which can be sold for use in greenhouses and beverage production.\n\nThe use of hBGO also allows concrete producers to benefit from carbon credits associated with cement avoidance, which is likely to increase its take-up.\n\nAlterBiota recently closed a CAD$4 million (around \u20ac2.7 million) seed financing round led by Invest Nova Scotia. The funds will be used for industrial product trials, the construction of a commercial-scale plant, and to commercialise the company's concrete additive.", "source": {"uri": "springwise.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Springwise"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forestry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carbon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portland cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emission_intensity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emission intensity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_additive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food additive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova_Scotia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nova Scotia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nova Scotia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Materials_and_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Materials and Supplies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Nanomaterials", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Nanomaterials", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Catalysts_and_Adsorbents", "label": "dmoz/Business/Chemicals/Catalysts and Adsorbents", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Carbon", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Carbon", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www./wp-content/uploads/2024/05/innovationproperty-constructionstrengthening-concrete-with-bio-graphene.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590224", "eventUri": "eng-9590224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

That is because it's made by heating limestone up to very high temperatures by burning fossil fuels. Recycling cement would massively reduce its carbon footprint. Researchers say that if they switched to electric-powered furnaces, and used renewable energy like wind and solar rather than fossil fuels, that could mean no greenhouse gases would be released at all.And that would be a big deal. Cement forms the foundation of the modern economy, both literally and metaphorically.It is what binds the sand and aggregate in concrete together, and concrete is the most widely used material on the planet after water.It is also a major driver of climate change. If cement was a country, it would be the third biggest source of emissions after China and the US, responsible for 7.5% of human-made CO2.The problem is the material's uniquely polluting chemistry.It is made by heating limestone to up 1600 Celsius in giant kilns powered by fossil fuels.Those emissions are just the start. The heat is used to drive carbon dioxide from the limestone molecules, leaving a residue of cement.Add both these sources of pollution together and it is estimated that about a tonne of carbon dioxide is produced for every tonne of cement.The team of scientists, from Cambridge University, has found a neat way to sidestep those emissions.It exploits the fact that you can reactivate used cement by exposing it to high temperatures again.The ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limestone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_aggregate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Construction aggregate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiln", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molecule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Hydrogen", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 67}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9590224", "eventUri": "eng-9590224", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The vote fueled concerns Trump's party will not approve more money for Ukraine if they take control of the House, Senate and White House in November.\n\nHowever, Johnson said in his first major national security address this week that Russia poses a threat beyond Ukraine, and that American voters have expressed support for the aid as he traveled around the country.\n\n\"People understand that (Russian President Vladimir Putin) would not stop if he took Kyiv.

REUTERS/KEVIN Mohatt\n\nBy Patricia Zengerle\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelinskiy returned to the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday to cement relationships with lawmakers who will vote on future U.S. aid for his country, which could be in jeopardy if former President Donald Trump is reelected.\n\nZelenskiy, who is in Washington for this week's NATO summit, met with leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives and members of committees involved in defense, spending, diplomacy and national security.\n\n\"It's an incredibly important mission and we've got to stand by Ukraine,\" Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner told Reuters.\n\nThe visit comes amid deep uncertainty about this year's U.S. presidential election, which pits incumbent Democrat Joe Biden, a strong supporter of aid to Ukraine, against the Republican Trump, who has expressed skepticism about the amount of aid given.\n\nZelenskiy awarded the Order of Merit of Ukraine to Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell before having lunch with a group of Democratic and Republican senators. He later sat down with the Republican House of Representatives speaker, Mike Johnson, telling reporters he had just invited Johnson to Kyiv.\n\nJohnson, a close Trump ally, said it would be difficult to find the time for a trip before the November election, when every seat in the House will be up for grabs and his fellow Republicans hope to preserve or expand their narrow majority.\n\n\"We'd sure like to. The schedule's pretty tight through the election for us, so it's difficult to find the time to go, but we'd certainly like to,\" Johnson said.\n\nBiden's uneven June 27 debate performance against Trump and low public approval have raised fresh doubts about his mental fitness, and a handful of congressional Democrats have called for Biden to step aside.\n\nReuters reported last month that two Trump advisers had presented the Republican candidate with a plan to end Russia's war in Ukraine - if he wins the Nov. 5 election - that involves telling Kyiv it will only get more U.S. weapons if it enters peace talks.\n\nZelenskiy urged U.S. political leaders in a speech on Tuesday not to wait for the outcome of the U.S. election before moving forcefully to help Ukraine and called for fewer restrictions on the use of U.S. weaponry.\n\nJOHNSON CHANGED COURSE\n\nIn Congress, dozens of Trump's closest allies have voted repeatedly against assisting Zelenskiy's government, although Democrats and more internationally focused Republicans have worked together to approve the $175 billion in aid for Ukraine Washington has approved since Russia invaded in February 2022.\n\nMost recently, Johnson changed course in April - months after Biden requested the money - and allowed the House to vote on and pass $61 billion in assistance for Ukraine.\n\nWhen Zelenskiy last visited Congress in December, Johnson had said he would not support Biden's request for additional funding.\n\nThe House passed the supplemental spending package by 311 to 112, with the \"no\" votes coming from conservative Republicans closely allied with Trump. The vote fueled concerns Trump's party will not approve more money for Ukraine if they take control of the House, Senate and White House in November.\n\nHowever, Johnson said in his first major national security address this week that Russia poses a threat beyond Ukraine, and that American voters have expressed support for the aid as he traveled around the country.\n\n\"People understand that (Russian President Vladimir Putin) would not stop if he took Kyiv. He's a ruthless dictator in my view,\" Johnson said.\n\n(Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; additional reporting by Doina Chiacu and Katharine Jackson; Editing by Don Durfee, Michael Perry and Deepa

The vote fueled concerns Trump's party will never approve more money for Ukraine if they take control of the House, Senate and White House in November.\n\nHowever, Johnson said in his first major national security address this week that Russia poses a threat beyond Ukraine, and American voters have expressed support for the aid as he traveled around the country.\n\n\"People understand that (Russian President Vladimir Putin) would not stop if he took Kyiv.

Amid political uncertainty with an upcoming U.S. presidential election, Zelenskiy aims to secure continued support for Ukraine's defense.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy returned to the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday to strengthen ties with lawmakers who are set to vote on future aid for Ukraine. He also expressed gratitude for the $175 billion already authorized since Russia's invasion in February 2022.\n\nDuring his Washington visit, in conjunction with this week's NATO summit, Zelenskiy is anticipated to meet with key Senate and House leaders as well as relevant defense, spending, diplomacy, and national security committees. 'It's an incredibly important mission and we've got to stand by Ukraine,' Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner told Reuters.\n\nThe visit occurs amid significant uncertainty surrounding the U.S. presidential election, where incumbent Democrat Joe Biden, an advocate for Ukraine aid, faces former Republican President Donald Trump, a skeptic. Biden's inconsistent debate performance on June 27 and low public approval have sparked doubts about his re-election prospects.\n\nSome congressional Democrats have suggested Biden should step aside for another candidate. Reuters disclosed last month that two Trump advisers proposed a plan for ending Russia's war in Ukraine, contingent on Trump winning the November 5 election, which includes pressuring Kyiv into peace talks by withholding U.S. military support.\n\nIn Congress, Trump's close allies have consistently voted against aiding Zelenskiy's government, though Democrats and internationally focused Republicans have approved the $175 billion in assistance. CONTINUED AID IN DOUBT\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Trump ally, reversed his stance in April, allowing a House vote on Biden's $61 billion aid request for Ukraine. Despite previously opposing extra funding, Johnson's pivot secured House approval of the spending package. However, Trump's party is unlikely to sanction more aid if it gains control of Congress and the White House.\n\nJohnson acknowledged Russia poses a broader threat than just to Ukraine, emphasizing this during his national security address. 'People understand that (Russian President Vladimir Putin) would not stop if he took Kyiv. He's a ruthless dictator in my view,' Johnson stated.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelenskyy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "President of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Warner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Warner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_05_2019_12_10_51_4304562.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9715026", "eventUri": "eng-9715026", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1217, "textEnd": 1224}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 1531, "textEnd": 1541}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

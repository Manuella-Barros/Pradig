{"id": 239806368, "title": "Triona McCarthy: Sharpen that smile with these top teeth products for straightening, strong gums and pearly wh", "text": "I needed to get it sorted so I decided to go to Seapoint Dental Clinic as my mum and brother both went there and were very happy, plus I did my research and only heard good reports. The actual process of getting fitted for the clear plastic braces was very easy. A dental nurse called Beth put me at ease and Dr Jim Griffin examined me thoroughly and said that I was suitable. I got my trays and there\u2019s an app to go with them so off I started on my journey. I\u2019m not gonna lie, I found it a lil hard to get used to leaving them in for 22 hours/day and only taking them out to eat, drink and brush my teeth. I was just getting the hang of it when I got the worst cold, and was feeling so sorry for myself that I forgot all about them for two weeks. I\u2019m back using them again (sorry, Dr Griffin!) and I\u2019ll keep you all posted. All that focus on teeth has led me to oral beauty this week. Jo Browne Bamboo Toothbrush, \u20ac7.95, brownthomas.com, is made from Moso bamboo and the bristles are made from nylon 6, which is free from Bisphenol A, a chemical produced in large quantities in the production of polycarbonate plastics. It\u2019s estimated that 3.6 billion plastic toothbrushes are used worldwide every year, and around 80pc of these end up in the sea where they pose a hazard, so bamboo toothbrushes are a winner in my eyes. As well as my teeth looking well, I also like having minty-fresh breath and am currently enjoying Polished London\u2019s Prebiotic Breath Drops, \u20ac12.95, polishedlondon.com. The drops are infused with apples and peppermint, and they\u2019re formulated using inulin, which nurtures gut health, and prebiotics to help the microbiome. I was really interested in trying the Novomins Vitamin D3 Gummies, \u20ac18, dowlingspharmacy.ie, as they bolster bone and muscle health, boost your immune system and keep your vitamin D levels topped up. They are devised by Dr Peter McQuillan, a celebrity dental surgeon who specialises in the process of nutrient absorption through the mouth. They bring you a high-strength burst of vitamin D3 in a lovely mango flavour, and are a great way to ensure you get your daily dose of sunshine, even when the sun is scarce. Always consult your GP before beginning supplements. And finally, I\u2019m giving a big toothy grin to Spotlight Oral Care Ultra Teeth Whitening Strips, \u20ac44.95 for a 14-day treatment, spotlightoralcare.com. Spotlight was founded by sisters and dentists, Lisa and Vanessa Creaven, who aim to provide the best clinically-proven and earth-kind oral care products possible. They have reformulated their strips to make your at-home experience even better, plus they protect enamel. Three of the best\u2026 Lip balms 1 Laneige Dreamy Lip Kit, \u20ac20.70, spacenk.com If you have a tween in your life then you\u2019ll be familiar with this brand. The four lip sleeping masks designed to nourish the lips are in yummy berry, mango, sweet candy and peach iced tea flavours. 2 asap Hydrating Lip Balm, \u20ac19, asapskincare.ie This balm by Australian cosmeceutical brand asap contains niacinamide to deeply moisturise lips and alpine rose to help reduce cold sore occurrence as well as spf15 for those sunny summery days. 3 The Ordinary Squalane + Amino Acids Lip Balm, \u20ac11.40, theordinary.com This brand new lip balm softens and hydrates dry lips through the use of biomimetic amino acids and squalane.

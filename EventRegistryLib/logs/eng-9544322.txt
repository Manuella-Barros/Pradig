I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it.'\n\nBritney closed out her post by admiring her longtime attorney, Mathew Rosengart, who she said is 'like a father' to her.

It's unclear if the video is new or from Britney's archives.\n\n'Ok I've been messing around and I thought this costume was beautiful !!! I used to do shows in Vegas with two layers of tights on my legs !!!' wrote the star, who famous held a Las Vegas residency at Planet Hollywood from 2013 to 2017.\n\nShe continued: 'They never let me show my real legs !!! It felt kinda weird and idiotic with a costume on my living room !!!'\n\nBritney then made reference to the late Prince, who famously wore flamboyant outfits on and off the stage.\n\n'Well Prince used to dress up in costumes everyday of his life in his house !!!

She sold it because she felt her family was taking advantage of her and using the home as if it were theirs -- but never inviting her to join them.\n\n'Lynne knows that she could easily do the same with Serenity, leaving her high and dry and homeless.'\n\nBritney and her mother have had a love-hate relationship for years. Prior to last week, the two had not spoken since December, when Lynne surprised Britney by traveling to LA to celebrate her 42nd birthday.\n\nThe mother-and-daughter duo were pictured in sweet snaps shared to social media, with images showing Britney cuddling up to Lynne on the couch and twirling her mom in the air.\n\nBritney and Lynne's estrangement was spearheaded by her claims Lynne didn't lift a finger to help free her daughter from her conservatorship.\n\nLast year they came to blows over claims Lynne threw out childhood dolls and journals from Britney's former family home.\n\nInsiders also claimed Lynne had been selling off her possessions both online and at a local consignment shop in Louisiana in recent years.\n\nLynne appeared to address her daughter's claims that she disposed of her belongings, insisting she wouldn't be so 'cruel.'\n\nBritney had previously claimed in her memoir The Woman in Me that her family saw her as nothing more than a 'cashflow.'\n\nThe incident at the Chateau Marmont was reminiscent of her infamous 2008 breakdown that landed her in an involuntary 5150 hold and led to her 13-year conservatorship (pictured)\n\nEarlier this month TMZ reported that Britney had become 'dysfunctional' and was in danger of going broke, something that was later slammed as 'inaccurate.'\n\nBritney famously shaved her head at a hair salon in Tarzana, a suburb of Los Angeles, in 2007, one day after she left a rehab facility in Antigua. She later re-entered treatment.\n\nA year later she was put under a court-ordered conservatorship which granted her father Jamie and a lawyer total control over her financial and personal affairs.\n\nIt was terminated in November 2021.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lynne Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Panic attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabasas,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Calabasas, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calabasas, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toxic (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thousand_Oaks,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thousand Oaks, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Thousand Oaks, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Rosengart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathew Rosengart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oops!..._I_Did_It_Again_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oops!...

In the footage, Britney sounds super excited as she chats up a cowboy delivering her a hat and riding in a grassy field as a dog runs nearby.\n\nThe content was bizarrely posted alongside a heated rant about what really went down at that hotel incident last week! As Perezcious readers know, paramedics were called to a Los Angeles hotel when she and her boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz were causing a scene. Supposedly they got loud and kicked out of a bar -- then got so rowdy she hurt her ankle!\n\nRelated: Jamie Lynn GUSHES Over Mom After Britney Blamed Her For Hotel Scandal!\n\nThe Baby One More Time vocalist was photographed leaving the establishment with her security without the need for the waiting ambulance. In the pics, she's covered in just a blanket -- and it doesn't look good, considering it's right as sources were coming out of the woodwork to raise their concerns about Britney's mental health and financial stability.\n\nThe Toxic singer has since clapped back at all the reports by insisting she merely sprained her ankle. However, it didn't help she also suggested she'd been \"set up\" by her mother Lynne.\n\nThat's pretty much still her version of the story -- except she's adding some key new details. The mother of two explained:\n\n\"I honestly wish my life was as wild as it has been portrayed !!! Either way, some s**t actually has happened to my foot and I might have to get surgery ... fingers crossed, hopefully not but I feel that I was harassed and gaslit and tricked to go on the street when my car was supposed to be there !!!

I am simply embarrassed they got me in my damn pajamas !!! I don't feel loved ... I feel mistreated !!! With that said, I'm going to treat myself this week !!!\"\n\nTreat herself? Well, we certainly hope it's just sprained and nothing more -- and she'll be fine with bed rest.\n\nThat said, this post is giving off very strange vibes because of the happy-go-lucky content compared to the heated caption! See (below):\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by XILA MARIA RIVER RED (@britneyspears)\n\nThe Grammy winner's foot has been seriously swollen, so it's not shocking to hear she might need surgery. No fun, though! We hope it heals quickly!\n\nAs for the manipulation accusations? Damn! Sounds like she really thinks someone was out to get her by forcing her outside under false pretenses just to continue to feed this so-called \"breakdown\" narrative. But would they?? She's out of her conservatorship, there's no one in charge of her anymore. What good would this do anyone? Is someone really trying to get her back in??\n\nWhat do y'all think? Are you buying that Britney might've been set up? Or do you think there's real reason to worry?

Britney was seen leaving the lavish hotel barefoot last week, prompting worries from fans.\n\nIn snaps shared online, the Toxic hitmaker was seen wearing almost no clothing and covering herself with only a blanket and pillow. She then later revealed an ankle injury. But Britney seems to be doing well since the rocky night at Chateau Marmont. She appeared to be in high spirits and looking content when she smiled behind the wheel of her car while driving around Thousand Oaks, which is northwest of LA.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Britney Spears shows off swollen ankle and blames mother after ambulance rushed to LA hotel\n\nBritney has broken her cover after her dramatic hotel stay\n\nShe did not appear to be in any distress, with her driving around calmly while wearing her blonde locks down and sporting a touch of makeup. Her trip seemingly suggested that her recent ankle injury was getting better, with it not preventing her from driving.\n\nThis comes after the Daily Mail reported that Britney had a heated argument with her felon ex-boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz last week. The argument led to the singer causing a scene inside the LA hotel, where Britney was said to be \"screaming\" in the hallway of her suite.\n\nThe singer was seen near LA\n\nAfter the public incident, a source revealed to TMZ that Britney and Paul returned to their hotel room where they \"partied and drank.\" But shortly after the pair were reported to have experienced a \"physical altercation in which Spears 'may have hurt her leg.'\"\n\nBritney later took to social media to show off her swollen ankle. In the caption of the snap, Britney penned: \"I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!! I was set up just like she did way back when !!!\" She continued: \"I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it !!!\"\n\nShe appeared to be driving well considering she showed off her 'swollen ankle' last week\n\nWhile showing off her swollen ankle and foot, Britney could be heard crying while explaining what happened. She told her Instagram followers that she \"really twisted her ankle last night like an idiot.\" She revealed that the injury came from trying to leap into the living room and she fell. She said it was \"so bad\" and spoke of how she was \"embarrassed\" in herself.\n\nShe also mentioned how the paramedics came and caused a huge scene, \"which was so unnecessary\" and all she needed was ice.\n\nThis comes as sources claim Britney needed to be kept in a conservatorship due to fears about her mental health. The singer was placed into a conservatorship in 2008, with her freed from it in November 2021 after the #FreeBritney movement erupted on social media.\n\nAfter her incident at the hotel last week, sources told Page Six they feared for Britney and argued that she should have remained in a conservatorship.

'At the time, Lynne was the only one who knew that she had hurt herself.\n\n'Lynne asked Britney if she was okay mentally and Britney told her mom that she was fine and it was just her ankle.\n\n'Lynne called 911 and told them that Britney was having a breakdown and had injured herself. She knew that Britney was in a traumatized state.'\n\nThe estranged duo had recently reconnected following the end of Britney's conservatorship battle with her father Jamie Spears, 71, and the finalization of her divorce from ex-husband Sam Asghari, 30.\n\nPhotographs taken the night of the incident showed the disheveled-looking pop star, barefoot and draped in a blanket - reminiscent of her infamous 2008 breakdown that landed her in an involuntary 5150 hold and ultimately lead to her 13-year conservatorship.\n\nExplaining her attire, the insider insisted it had nothing to do with her mental state.\n\n'When the ambulance arrived at the Chateau, they went directly to Britney's room and told her that they needed to make sure that she was okay after someone had called the paramedics,' they said.\n\n'When Britney looked out, she saw the ambulance and the gurney and she flipped out. She had a severe panic attack because seeing a gurney for her is traumatizing, for obvious reasons.\n\nIn an Instagram post, Britney claimed she was 'set up' by Lynne, 60, and rubbished claims she had suffered a mental breakdown as she posted a video of her swollen ankle\n\nSources tell DailyMail.com Lynne is now fearing Britney will sell Serenity, the Kentwood, Louisiana mansion she has lived in since Britney bought it in 2001. The singer is still the owner\n\n'Britney then grabbed a blanket and a pillow, leaving her belongings at the hotel. She did not have shoes on because her ankle was injured. She was not going to get in an ambulance and was not about to get checked out by them for an injured ankle.'\n\nAccording to the source, the Toxic singer - who was at the hotel with her felon boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz - was determined to flee.\n\nThe source continued: 'She said, \"I am getting the f***k out of here.\" She walked past the ambulance and got into a ride that was waiting for her out front.\n\n'She did not return to the Chateau.'\n\nBritney rubbished claims she had suffered a mental breakdown on Instagram - and posted a video of her swollen ankle.\n\n'Okay guys, so you know, I really twisted my ankle last night,' she said. 'It's so bad. Idiot right here tried to do a leap in the living room at the Chateau and I fell and embarrassed myself and that's it.'\n\nIt was later claimed she had been doing cartwheels while drinking alcohol.\n\n'Paramedics came to the door illegally and caused this huge scene and it was so unnecessary and all I needed was ice,' she said.\n\nThe Oops I Did It Again singer started crying and added: 'It is pretty mad but s***t happens.'\n\nIn the caption, Britney placed blame on her mother Lynne.\n\nBritney was at the celebrity hotspot with her boyfriend Paul Soliz - her former housekeeper - who accompanied the near-naked singer when she fled in a rage\n\nThe Toxic singer was said to have been traumatized on seeing a gurney and believing it was a 'set up' by her mom. She later claimed paramedics arrived at her room 'illegally'\n\n'I know my mom was involved !!! I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out !!!' she wrote.\n\n'I was set up just like she did way back when !!! I wish I had grandparents !!! I can't stand her !!! I honestly don't care I will say it.'\n\nBritney finished her post by praising her longtime attorney, Mathew Rosengart, who she said is 'like a father' to her.\n\nShe wrote: 'Psss this man is wonderful !!! He's like a father to me and he got me through last night !!! I adore you and admire you mister Mathew !!!'\n\nDailyMail.com contacted Rosengart, representatives for Britney and Lynne for comment.\n\nThe incident is believed to be the final straw for Britney who is now keen to sell Serenity, the mansion she had built in Kentwood, Louisiana in 2001, which her mother has lived in for two decades.\n\n'Britney is now going to sell Serenity,' the insider said. 'The incident at Chateau Marmont was the last straw.'\n\nA separate source close to the pop princess told DailyMail.com that Lynne is desperate to salvage her relationship with her daughter over fears she will leave her homeless.\n\nLynne was photographed at LAX, less than 48 hours after the incident, where she was greeted by her son Bryan and her granddaughter.\n\nLynne was photographed at LAX, less than 48 hours after the incident. Asked if she would 'always be there no matter what' for her daughter - she simply nodded (pictured in 1999)\n\nAsked if she would 'always be there no matter what' for her daughter - she simply nodded.\n\nBritney's father previously claimed that Serenity, and all the costs associated with maintaining it, were never paid for by Lynne.\n\n'Lynne has not been involved in her daughter's life for most of the past twelve years,' he stated in court documents in 2021. 'Despite their estranged relationship, the Conservatorship Estate, during the entire duration of the Conservatorship, has paid and continues to pay for the mansion in Louisiana where Lynne lives.\n\n'This includes all of her utility bills, weekly maid service, and all maintenance (totaling upwards of $150,000 per year and to date, nearly $2,000,000 in total).'\n\nCourt documents also revealed that Britney has spent approximately $1.7 million on her mother over the years.\n\nLynne, who went back to work as a substitute teacher in Kentwood last year, filed for chapter 7 - liquidation bankruptcy - in 1998. She has owned five companies in the past 20 years, including Britney Online, Inc. and One More Time Music, Inc. but is no longer involved in any of them.\n\nBritney previously sold the condo she owned in Destin, Florida, just one year after her release from the conservatorship. She purchased the property, which Lynne would use for vacation, in 2001 for $920,000 under an LLC.\n\nBritney thanked her 'wonderful' lawyer Mathew Rosengart (pictured together in 2022) for 'getting her through' her chaotic night at the Chateau Marmont\n\n'This man is wonderful! He's like a father to me and he got me through last night! I adore you and admire you mister Mathew,' Britney wrote about the federal prosecutor\n\n'Lynne used to spend so much time at Britney's condo and it was her favorite place to escape,' the second insider told DailyMail.com.\n\n'Britney didn't even give Lynne the opportunity to get her belongings out of the home before she sold it.\n\n'But Britney didn't sell it because she was broke. She sold it because she felt her family was taking advantage of her and using the home as if it were theirs - but never inviting her to join them.\n\n'Lynne knows that she could easily do the same with Serenity, leaving her high and dry and homeless.'\n\nBritney and her mother have had a love-hate relationship for years. Prior to last week, the two had not spoken since December, when Lynne surprised Britney by traveling to LA to celebrate her 42nd birthday.\n\nThe mother-and-daughter duo were pictured in sweet snaps shared to social media, with images showing Britney cuddling up to Lynne on the couch and twirling her mom in the air.\n\nBritney and Lynne's estrangement was spearheaded by her claims Lynne didn't lift a finger to help free her daughter from her conservatorship.\n\nLast year they came to blows over claims Lynne threw out childhood dolls and journals from Britney's former family home.\n\nThe incident was reminiscent of her infamous 2008 breakdown that landed her in an involuntary 5150 hold and ultimately lead to her 13-year conservatorship (pictured)\n\nInsiders also claimed Lynne had been selling off her possessions both online and at a local consignment shop in Louisiana in recent years.\n\nLynne appeared to address her daughter's claims that she disposed of her belongings, insisting she wouldn't be so 'cruel'.\n\nBritney had previously claimed in her memoir The Woman in Me that her family saw her as nothing more than a 'cashflow.'\n\nEarlier this month TMZ reported that Britney had become 'dysfunctional' and was in danger of going broke, something that was later slammed as 'inaccurate.'\n\nBritney famously shaved her head at a hair salon in Tarzana, a suburb of Los Angeles, in 2007, one day after she left a rehab facility in Antigua. She later re-entered treatment.\n\nA year later she was put under a court-ordered conservatorship which granted her father Jamie and a lawyer total control over her financial and personal affairs.\n\nIt was terminated in November 2021.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lynne Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Panic attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanterman\u2013Petris\u2013Short_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lanterman\u2013Petris\u2013Short Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mansion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toxic (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barefoot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentwood,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentwood, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentwood, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Rosengart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathew Rosengart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oops!..._I_Did_It_Again_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oops!...

Ex Claims He's a 'Deadbeat' Dad", "body": "Gabby Petito's Texts Show 'More and More Tension' With Brian Laundrie\n\nBritney Spears and her boyfriend, Paul Richard Soliz, recently made headlines for their alleged argument at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles. The singer's new flame, who once worked as a housekeeper in her home, has reportedly raised some red flags for people in her inner circle. Now, Paul's ex Nicole Mancilla has heightened concerns by claiming that he's a \"deadbeat dad\" to at least nine kids.\n\nNicole, who was allegedly once married to Paul, claimed in a May 6, 2024, interview with Daily Mail that he is the father to her five children, but he \"doesn't support not one kid. And they're at my house.\"\n\n\"He's a deadbeat dad,\" she added. \"It's difficult for me.\" Court documents filed by the Los Angeles County Support Services on March 22, 2024, demanded that Paul pay $1,167 per month in child support starting May 1, 2024, as well as 50 percent of healthcare costs for 9-year-old child Trystan, 8-year-old Dylan and 21-month-old Violet, according to the publication. The complaint revealed that the children have been receiving public benefits since January 2020.\n\nPaul's income was listed as $2,774 per month, and Nicole's as zero, according to Daily Mail.\n\nA separate filing in September 2021 named Paul as the father of a 17-year-old named Cesar and a 6-year-old named Nicholas in addition to Trystan and Dylan.\n\nNicole also claimed in her interview with the outlet that Paul had at least four other children, calling him \"the EBT Nick Cannon.\"\n\n\"Just let them know that my husband fell in Britney Spears' p -- y. He was married, and now he denies his children,\" she said. \"He neglects his children for her.\"\n\nNicole's mom, surgical assistant Sandra Smith, who lives with Nicole and her kids in L.A., added, \"He has ten kids. He doesn't support any of them. They have a 1-year-old together and he doesn't even pay attention to that one either.\"\n\nPaul was hired as a housekeeper in Britney's home in 2022. However, he was reportedly let go from the position when his criminal record, which includes disturbing the peace, child endangerment and firearm possession, was discovered. Britney and Paul sparked dating rumors in August 2023 shortly after her split from ex-husband Sam Asghari. The two allegedly split after a month, although some speculated that they remained together.\n\n\"Britney and Paul are definitely together,\" one source told Us Weekly in February 2024. \"He's still in the picture.\"\n\nOn May 2, 2024, news broke that Britney and Paul allegedly got into an argument at the Chateau Marmont hotel the night before and an ambulance was called due to concerns about the pop star possibly having a mental breakdown. She was \"out of control, crying, possibly cut, and almost driven away in an ambulance,\" TMZ reported.\n\nPrior to the ambulance being called, a woman matching Britney's description allegedly caused a disturbance in the lobby by \"harassing and threatening hotel employees and guests.\" Authorities were called to the scene but left when they found no signs of trouble. Britney and her boyfriend reportedly went back to their room around 11 p.m., when an altercation between them allegedly became physical. Hotel guests then called the ambulance out of fear that someone was injured, sources told the publication.\n\nBritney claimed on May 2 that the \"news is fake\" and that photos of her at the scene were actually of \"body doubles.\" I think most know that !!! I would like respect at this time for people to understand I am getting stronger everyday!! Truth sucks so can someone teach me how to lie???\" she wrote on Instagram, later claiming that she \"twisted my ankle and paramedics showed up at my door illegally.\"\n\nThe \"Toxic\" singer also claimed that her mother, Lynne Spears, was \"involved\" in the hotel incident. \"I haven't talked to her in 6 months and she called right after it happened before the news being out,\" she wrote. \"I was set up just like she did way back when !!!

Onlookers claimed that the couple were having an altercation and that the singer was injured. Police and paramedics were dispatched to the scene. However, no arrests were made. Britney later left with members of her team sans her boyfriend. Now, more reports about her mental state are being revealed.\n\nAn insider who witnessed Spears' hotel meltdown tells In Touch that the singer wasn't acting coherent during the encounter. \"Britney seemed completely out of it,\" the source revealed. \"If she wasn't high on something, she was definitely off her meds.\"\n\nBack in August 2023 when Britney Spears was married to Sam Asghari, reports suggested that major fights led to their divorce. Another sour spot in their marriage was allegedly due to the iconic singer refusing to go back on her medication.\n\n\"Britney is not a well person without the correct medication,\" a source informed OK! Magazine. \"No matter what she told her conservatorship judge or assures fans, she needs stability through a very regimented program of meds. After she was released from the conservatorship, she attempted to move away from being reliant on medication,\" the insider continued. \"However, in the last year that has caused many issues with her behavior becoming erratic, violent and even dangerous.\"\n\nSam Asghari reportedly urged Britney Spears to seek therapy and find a doctor who could help her control her mental health issues.

I hate to say it, but he could be vindicated.\"\n\nThe source highlighted how Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny did not put Britney through an evaluation when she ended the conservatorship.\n\nAt the time, Judge Penny said there was \"no need for a capacity declaration\" of Spears, and stressed it had been a voluntary conservatorship.\n\nA former boyfriend of the singer, who dated her for several years while she was under the conservatorship, also told Page Six, \"I think she needs to... pick up the Bible.\n\n\"She always said, too, that she wanted to go home to Louisiana. I hope she does. I'm not sure why she's still in LA. It's a cesspool there.\"\n\nBritney was seen on Thursday hobbling out of the Chateau on Thursday barefoot and wrapped in a blanket, wearing only underwear, as she was escorted towards emergency services.\n\nMultiple reports have said she had fought with her alleged ex-boyfriend Paul Richard Soliz, but the singer has since insisted paramedics were only called to the hotel as she suffered a sprained ankle.\n\nBritney has also prompted fears for her mental health with her outpouring of bizarre social media posts in the last year, including nude photos and videos that are said to upset her children, and a now infamous clip of her dancing with a pair of huge kitchen knives at her home.", "source": {"uri": "home.nzcity.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZCity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toxic (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Spears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Superior_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles County Superior Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544322", "eventUri": "eng-9544322", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

This is heartbreaking to him. Sam is a helper and was there for her in her hardest times. He hopes she is OK.\"\n\nThe insider noted that while Britney - who regained control of her multimillion-dollar fortune and various aspects of her life when a conservatorship that had been governed by her family was terminated in 2021 - \"doesn't communicate\" with Sam anymore, he found the pictures at the LA hotel to be \"definitely worrisome\".\n\nThe source added: \"Sam has been down this road with Britney before and knows how she is, he feels terrible if she is not surrounded by positive people in her life. Sam will always wish [Spears] the best and would be there for her if she needed him.\"\n\nJust hours after the incident took place, the '...Baby One More Time' hitmaker - who finalised her divorce from Sam that same day - took to Instagram to claim that she had simply suffered a \"twisted ankle\" and that there was no more to the story.\n\nShe said: \"I really twisted my ankle last night like an idiot - just to show proof.

Of course, caused this huge scene, which was so unnecessary and all I needed was ice.\n\n\"It is actually pretty bad but [stuff] happens.\"\n\nBritney went on to slam her mother Lynne Spears for getting involved in the drama and claims she was \"set up\".\n\nIn a caption posted alongside a second video, Britney wrote: \"I haven't talked to her in six months and she called right after it happened before the news being out.\n\n\"I was set up just like she did way back when !!!

Barefoot, wearing short shorts, draped with a blanket and clutching a pillow to her apparently topless chest, a disheveled Britney Spears walked out of the Chateau Marmont Hotel in L.A. in the early morning hours of May 2 with her security and her boyfriend, convicted felon Paul Richard Soliz, as first responders swarmed around them. An ambulance and fire trucks had been dispatched to the scene following a 911 call at 12:42 a.m., an LAFD spokesperson said, \"with reports of an adult female injured,\" though Britney was not taken to the hospital. (She later claimed in a rambling Instagram post that she'd twisted her ankle.)\n\nBut the incident was alarmingly reminiscent of her dark past. \"She had a boozefueled bust-up in a hotel room with Paul and refused treatment,\" says a source, adding that a \"crazed\" Britney, who's been boasting about drinking wine, hit \"rock bottom\" after a seven-day spiral that began on April 25 when the pair were caught behaving erratically in a series of dramatic photos.\n\n\"It's like 2008 all over again.\" That year began with a series of public meltdowns, prompting her father, Jamie, to take charge of her life via the infamous conservatorship, which would last for the next 13 years. Though she was finally freed in 2021, the troubled pop star settled a legal dispute over her dad's management of her finances on April 25, in which she was reportedly ordered to pay him $2 million in legal fees from her already dwindling bank account. Then on May 2, she settled her divorce from Sam Asghari, who had long been considered a stabilizing influence.\n\n\"Now, she's hanging out with this criminal, and friends fear history is repeating itself,\" the source says of Paul, who was first hired to do housework around her L.A. mansion in 2022. \"She's in serious danger.\"\n\nIt's no secret that Britney has been lonely. \"She's usually holed up around her mansion all day, making disturbing videos,\" says the source, adding that Paul \"provided a distraction. They've been hooking up for a while. Sam was convinced she cheated on him with Paul because of how she openly flirted with him.\"\n\nThe 38-year-old sure seems sweet on Britney, 42. \"She's a phenomenal woman,\" he's gushed. \"She's very good, positive .... She's a good person.\"\n\nBut is he? \"I'm not a bad dude. I understand that things have been said about me and that I have a criminal record. I get it. But I'm a working man,\" insists Paul, who was convicted of possession of a firearm by a narcotic addict in December 2022, stemming from a 2020 incident, and had previously been convicted of robbery in 2008, among a slew of other arrests. He has also revealed he has \"a handful\" of kids with a late ex, including one who is involuntarily hospitalized in a mental institution.\n\n\"That certainly raises red flags, considering Britney's history,\" says the source. \"Who knows what his motives are?\"\n\nHer loved ones are so concerned that they are considering a drastic step. \"There's actually been talk of pursuing another conservatorship,\" the source says of her friends and family, who have attempted at least one intervention since 2021, and fans have even called 911 on her behalf. \"No one wants to see it go this far, especially because of all the publicity and backlash over the last one, but Britney really needs help.\"\n\nPosting disturbing videos -- including one in early May where she called her little sister, Jamie Lynn, \"a bitch\" online is one thing, adds the source, \"but now she's intimately involved with a felon and she's been drinking, which she should definitely not be doing if she's taking medication for her bipolar disorder.\"\n\nThe star is also reportedly blowing through the $60 million she had when her conservatorship ended, thanks to monthly trips on private jets to luxury resorts in Hawaii and French Polynesia. And since she's vowed to never make music again, \"she needs to save her money,\" notes the source.\n\nTime is running out. \"This latest meltdown proves Britney's only getting worse,\" says the source. \"Her friends and family are desperate to save her before it's too late.\"", "source": {"uri": "intouchweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "In Touch Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alyssa_norwin@intouchweekly.com", "name": "Alyssa Norwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chateau_Marmont", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chateau Marmont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Fire_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Fire Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fire engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Asghari", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Asghari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Lynn_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Lynn Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipolar disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narcotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hawaii"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Polynesia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French Polynesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "French Polynesia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Journals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Journals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/brintey-spears-in-danger-with-paul-soliz-friends-fear.jpg?crop=0px%2C48px%2C2215px%2C1163px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544322", "eventUri": "eng-9544322", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 310, "textEnd": 315, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1012, "textEnd": 1020, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

It makes sense if you think about it -- delicious food, great areas to walk and clear your mind, one of the most equally loved and hated accents in the world, randomly being told you're number one with help from a middle finger by a stranger -- it's a well-rounded spot.\n\nBut in that list above of New England areas Britney has toured through, there's one glaring missing piece.\n\nSimple answer: no.\n\nIn fact, the only thing that pops up when you Google search \"Britney Spears Maine,\" \"Britney Spears in Maine,\" or anything like it, is headlines from Maine news sites about Britney. But, apparently, she's never once in her travels to Boston or Manchester, made the quick trek north to Vacationland.\n\nBut what if she did? Follow along.\n\nIf you take a peek at Britney's Instagram, it's a mixture of random pictures, memes, and videos of her dancing. But the one thing it's not? Following her every move and location.\n\nEven in the dancing videos, the camera is always in the same spot, showing the same background view. Unlike other celebrities, she doesn't tag her location ever -- she doesn't even toss a quickie post up on her story like \"OMG JUST BOUGHT A MOCHA FRAPPA WHATEVER THE HELL AT MY FAVORITE COFFEE SHOP, Y'ALL!\"\n\nBasically, she's been giving real lowkey vibes lately, meaning maybe she's ready to live a lowkey life. That said, instead of moving to Boston where the spotlight will shine on her, what if she moved to Maine for a more under-the-radar existence?", "source": {"uri": "92moose.fm", "dataType": "news", "title": "92 Moose"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Britney Spears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Providence,_Rhode_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Providence, Rhode Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Providence, Rhode Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worcester,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Worcester, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansfield,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mansfield, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coffeehouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Big_Dig", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Big Dig", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/696/files/2024/05/attachment-Britney-Boston-Maine.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544322", "eventUri": "eng-9544322", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

On Monday, she was spotted whipping her white Mercedes-Benz around the California city of Thousand Oaks -- which comes as somewhat of a surprise as she said may need surgery for her foot! We're no doctor, but shouldn't she be resting it?? It looked SUPER swollen in the snaps.

The two were all smiles as they drove around clad in sunglasses with their windows down. See for yourself (below):\n\nThis is the first time the pair has been spotted together since their hotel incident, which the pop star feels was a \"set up\" involving her mom Lynne Spears to feed into the narrative that she's having a breakdown.

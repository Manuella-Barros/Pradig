During his 2020 leadership campaign, Sir Keir Starmer promised to abolish the House of Lords, but according to reports in The Times the Labour leader appears to have abandoned this. According to the newspaper, Labour\u2019s election manifesto \u2013 which was agreed at the party\u2019s closed-doors Clause V meeting on Friday \u2013 will include plans to introduce an age limit for peers and scrap new hereditary roles. In 2022, he backed a report drawn up by former prime minister Gordon Brown that sets out plans for a regionally elected chamber that is around a quarter the size of now. At the time, the Labour leader said he would abolish the \u201cindefensible\u201d House of Lords \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d, ideally within the first term of a Labour government. Left-wing campaign group Momentum accused the Labour leadership of promising change but being \u201callergic\u201d to following through with it. Under the proposals, peers will be able to serve until they are 80 years old, or until the end of the parliament in which they reach that age. A ban on new hereditary peers is also suggested in a bid to reduce the size of the House. A spokesperson for Momentum said: \u201cThis is yet another disappointing Starmer U-turn. \u201cThe House of Lords is an anti-democratic institution well past its sell-by date. Years of Tory cronyism underline the need to scrap a system based on patronage among our political elite. \u201cKeir was right to pledge to abolish it in 2020 and again in 2022, following strong, detailed proposals from Gordon Brown. But once again, major progressive reforms have been junked by a Labour Leadership which rightly pledges change, but seems allergic to enacting it.\u201d This comes as Unite, one of the UK\u2019s largest trade unions, declined to endorse the manifesto. Sources told the PA news agency that Labour\u2019s stance on practices like fire-and-rehire meant the affiliated union could not support its policy platform Momentum also said it was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d the party had not committed to free school meals or scrapping the two-child benefit cap. \u201cWe need to kick out not just the Tories, but Tory policies too,\u201d a spokesperson said. Speaking at a 3 Lock Brewing Company in Camden on Saturday, Sir Keir said there \u201cwon\u2019t be any surprises on tax\u201d in Labour\u2019s manifesto. He added: \u201cWe finalised our manifesto yesterday, which was a great moment because at the end of the meeting it was acclaimed by everybody in the meeting.\u201d \u201cI want the 2024 manifesto to be a story as it is about the future of the country, and to provide the winning platform for that election as we go into it,\u201d he said.", "summary": "The party\u2019s manifesto will include plans to introduce an age limit for peers and scrap new hereditary roles, the Times reports.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/house-of-lords-keir-starmer-labour-gordon-brown-the-times-b1163088.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/06/08/17/2304ba8ce6070a30d168c0b27f98651bY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3OTUwNDk3-2.74480243.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:34:05", "author": "Rhiannon James", "authors": ["Rhiannon James"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.15}

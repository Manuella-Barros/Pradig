Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, and five of his House of Representatives colleagues to remain dedicated to reforming Nigeria.\n\nObasanjo stressed the importance of transparent and efficient governance and urged them to focus their efforts on enacting legislation that improves the lives of Nigerian citizens, saying: \"Nigeria needs to get leadership right to overcome challenges within two and a half years.\"\n\nObasanjo made this call on Friday during a meeting with the six federal lawmakers, led by Hon. Ugochinyere, who also serves as the chairman of the House Committee on Downstream Petroleum.\n\nThe meeting took place at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library in Abeokuta, Ogun State.\n\nThe other lawmakers present were Hon. Abdulmalik Danga (Adavi/Okehi), Dr. Usman Midala (Askira-Uba/Hawul), Hon. Peter Aniekwe (Anambra East/West), and Kama Nkemkanma (Ohaozara/Onicha/Ivo federal constituency).\n\nBefore the meeting went into a closed-door session, Obasanjo expressed concern about Nigeria's current economic difficulties. He stated that the country needs \"moral rearmament\" to address its socio-economic challenges and insisted that progress is impossible without changes in governance.\n\nObasanjo noted that proposals for a single presidential term, one-day nationwide elections, and a rotation of power between the North and South can only be effective if principled leaders are in place. He stressed that Nigeria will only advance when individuals with integrity and good role models hold positions of power.\n\nObasanjo stated, \"Nigeria needs to get leadership right to overcome challenges within two and a half years. In ten years, we should consolidate achievements, and in 25 years, we could see significant progress. Our problem is that we often take steps forward and backwards, which impedes progress.\n\n\"We need to rethink democracy and adapt a model that works for Africa. Whether we have a single six-year term or two four-year terms, our focus should be on improving our mentality and approach.\n\n\"We must address our own issues before worrying about term lengths. If the same mindset prevails in power, nothing will change. The real starting point is ourselves.\"\n\nUgochinyere, in his remarks, stated that they met with Obasanjo to discuss national issues, express solidarity, and gain insights into development and good governance. He praised Obasanjo for his previous reforms and expressed regret that past administrations did not build upon them.\n\nUgochinyere noted, \"If previous governments had continued with electricity reforms, foreign policies, civil service reforms, and digital reforms, we would not be facing the current economic challenges. Your reforms laid important foundations, and we hope the current administration can build upon them.\"\n\nHe informed Obasanjo that the lawmakers are co-sponsoring bills for a single six-year presidential term, power rotation between the North and South, and one-day elections to address systemic issues.\n\nHon. Abdulmalik Danga also appealed to Obasanjo to support the idea of rotating power within the three senatorial districts of each state to reduce marginalisation and ethnic agitation. Danga suggested including this rotation in the constitutional amendment to ensure fair representation across all regions.", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideato_North", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ideato North"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ideato North"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olusegun_Obasanjo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olusegun Obasanjo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Imo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olusegun_Obasanjo_Presidential_Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawul", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hawul"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohaozara", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohaozara"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohaozara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onicha", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Onicha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Onicha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anambra_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anambra East"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anambra East"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okehi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Okehi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Okehi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adavi,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adavi, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adavi, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abeokuta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abeokuta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abeokuta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_amendment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional amendment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Obasanjo-Ugochinyere-and-others-640x360.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804566", "eventUri": "eng-9804566", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

He argued that Nigeria requires a \"moral rearmament\" to overcome the socio-economic challenges it faces, emphasising that true progress cannot be achieved without significant changes in governance practices.\n\nObasanjo pointed out that proposals such as a single term for the President, holding all elections on a single day, and rotating power between the North and South, can only succeed if leaders of integrity and uprightness emerge. He maintained that Nigeria will only move forward when individuals with strong moral character occupy leadership positions, asserting that the number of terms in office would only matter if the right people are in charge.\n\nREAD MORE: I inherited \u20a63.2bn debt, \u20a6500m missing funds on assumption of office -- NAFDAC DG\n\nThe former President further argued that it is not merely a matter of changing the system but rethinking democracy itself. He suggested that the Western model of Liberal Democracy might not be suitable for Africa, advocating instead for a system that aligns with Africa's tradition of consensus-building. He stressed that if Nigeria gets its leadership right, the country could overcome its challenges within a few years and lay a solid foundation for lasting progress.\n\nIn response, Hon. Ugochinyere said the delegation had come to Abeokuta to consult with Obasanjo on a range of national issues and to express their solidarity with the former President. Ugochinyere praised Obasanjo for his visionary leadership during his presidency, particularly the foundational reforms he implemented between 1999 and 2007, which, he said, set Nigeria on a path to progress. He lamented that subsequent governments had failed to build on these reforms, which he argued has contributed to the economic difficulties the country now faces.\n\nUgochinyere informed Obasanjo that the lawmakers were co-sponsoring bills aimed at introducing a single six-year term for presidents and governors, mandating power rotation between the North and South, and setting a single day for all elections. He emphasised that these reforms are crucial for eradicating the bandwagon effect and ensuring equitable governance.\n\nREAD MORE: Coalition insists on sack of NNPCL GCEO Kyari over failure to fix refineries\n\nHon.

He lamented the regression in national development efforts, attributing it to the removal of critical building blocks.\n\nAccording to the former President, Nigeria has taken two steps forward and four steps backwards since his administration ended in 2007.\n\n\"As I have warned earlier, we should recognise that we are all sitting on a powder keg if we fail to begin doing the right thing. For instance, what the youth are demanding is very legitimate and should be listened to. Why should they be denied what rightfully belongs to them? They are frustrated, they are hungry, they are angry, they are unemployed, and they deserve to be heard\", he said.\n\nNoting that many in government should currently be behind bars or on the gallows, Obasanjo proposed a re-evaluation of Nigeria's democratic structure, beyond changing the country's system of government to thinking and character change.\n\nWhile answering the representatives about whether a single six-year term is the way to go or not, Obasanjo said, \"More than anything else, such as changing our system of government or adopting a single term of six or four years, we must change our ways of doing things. We must reform our thinking and character. I wish that succeeding governments had built upon the foundation we laid, even if not as quickly as hoped, but sadly, the blocks we put in place are being removed.\"\n\n\"What I know about Nigeria is that if we get it right -- both leadership and team -- because one tree does not make a forest, you need a good leader but also a good team for a well-done job. If we get it right in about two and a half years, we could overcome some challenges, and in about 10 years, we will have a solid foundation. In about 25 years, we could be there. But we always take one step forward, two steps aside, and four steps backwards, which is why we are where we are.\n\n\"For me, it is not just about the system; we may need to rethink our liberal democracy. In Africa, we often talk about loyal opposition, but what we do is reach a consensus and then there is no opposition; everyone is on the same page and moves together. In many African languages, the word for opposition translates to 'enemies.' What do you do with loyal enemies? Once you take power, you claim everything, and the opposition is left in the wilderness. This approach is not beneficial. We need everyone to join hands to advance society.\n\n\"Our main problem is ourselves.

We must reform our thinking and character.\n\n\"I wish that succeeding governments had built upon the foundation we laid, even if not as quickly as hoped, but sadly, the blocks we put in place are being removed.\n\n\"What I know about Nigeria is that if we get it right -- both leadership and team -- because one tree does not make a forest, you need a good leader but also a good team for a well-done job.\n\n\"If we get it right in about two and a half years, we could overcome some challenges, and in about 10 years, we will have a solid foundation. In about 25 years, we could be there.\n\n\"But we always take one step forward, two steps aside, and four steps backward, which is why we are where we are.\n\n\"For me, it is not just about the system; we may need to rethink our liberal democracy. In Africa, we often talk about loyal opposition, but what we do is reach a consensus, and then there is no opposition; everyone is on the same page and moves together.\n\n\"In many African languages, the word for opposition translates to 'enemies.' What do you do with loyal enemies? Once you take power, you claim everything, and the opposition is left in the wilderness. This approach is not beneficial. We need everyone to join hands to advance society.\n\n\"Our main problem is ourselves. Whether we adopt a single term of six years or two terms of four years, if we maintain the same mentality and approach, nothing will change.", "source": {"uri": "naijanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "enioluwa_adeniyi@naijanews.com", "name": "Enioluwa Adeniyi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olusegun_Obasanjo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olusegun Obasanjo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Imo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olusegun_Obasanjo_Presidential_Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogi_State", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kogi State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kogi State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebonyi_State", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ebonyi State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ebonyi State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abeokuta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abeokuta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abeokuta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anambra_State", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anambra State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Anambra State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borno_State", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Symfoni-1024x768-1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9804566", "eventUri": "eng-9804566", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Ugochinyere Ikenga, representing the Ideato North and South Federal Constituency of Imo State.\n\nOther lawmakers in attendance were Honourables Abdulmalik Danga (representing Adavi/Okehi), Dr. Usman Midala (Askira-Uba/Hawul), Hon. Peter Aniekwe (Anambra East/West), and Kama Nkemkanma (Ohaozara/Onicha/Ivo) federal constituencies.\n\nThe former president stated that the nation's challenges would be overcome if Nigerians critically re-examined themselves and consistently did the right thing.\n\nObasanjo noted that the lawmakers' calls for a single-term presidency, nationwide elections on one day, and power rotation between the North and South were not sufficient to put the nation on the right track.\n\nHe attributed purposeful leadership and a solid team as the only factors capable of driving positive development in the country.\n\n\"What I know about Nigeria is that we need to get it right in terms of leadership and the team. The point is that, within two and a half years, we can overcome these challenges.\n\nIn another 10 years, we need to consolidate what we have achieved, and in 25 years, we will be there. Our problem is that we take two steps forward and probably two steps backward, and that won't get us anywhere.\n\n\"For me, it's not just about the system; we need to rethink what we call democracy. We need to reconsider the Western Liberal Democracy model, where we talk about loyal opposition.\n\n\"In the African system, we typically work through consensus. We need to join hands to make things work. If we get it right, whether we have a single six-year term presidency or two four-year terms, we need to work on our mentality.\n\nWe have to decarbonize our brains. Our main problem is ourselves. Until we address our own issues, the length of office terms won't matter.\n\nIf the same people with the same mentality are in power, nothing will change. Our starting point is ourselves,\" the former president added.\n\nObasanjo further stated that Nigerians should elect leaders with proven pedigree and character capable of addressing the nation's myriad challenges.\n\nALSO READ: Inflation: Cost of living increases by 19% in one month -- NBS\n\nHe insisted that Nigeria will only progress when upright individuals and good role models are in positions of power, emphasizing that the number of terms spent in office is inconsequential if the wrong people are in leadership roles.\n\nIkenga, in his welcome remarks, said the lawmakers were in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, to express their solidarity with the former president and to learn from his extensive knowledge on development and good governance.\n\nThe lawmaker commended Obasanjo for the various reforms implemented during his administration, blaming successive governments for failing to build on these reforms for the benefit of Nigerians.\n\n\"If there had been consolidation of electricity reforms, foreign policies, civil service reforms, and digital reforms by successive governments, we would not be facing the economic challenges we are today.\n\nIf not for the foundation you laid in 1999, things would have been worse.\n\nAt that time, many did not see Nigeria's future, but we can now see the impact of your efforts in telecommunications reform, civil service reforms, and the establishment of anti-corruption agencies,\" he added.\n\nIkenga informed Obasanjo that the lawmakers were co-sponsors of bills seeking a single six-year term for the president and governors, power rotation between the northern and southern parts of the country, and a single day for presidential, governorship, national assembly, and state assembly elections, to eliminate

Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, the lawmaker representing Ideato North/South federal constituency of Imo State and five others of his colleagues in the House of Representatives, to remain committed in the quest for reformed Nigeria that is transparently and efficiently run while consistently channelling their energies into enacting legislations that are geared towards improving the livelihood of the Nigerian masses.\n\nThe former President gave the charge on Friday while playing host to the six federal lawmakers led by Hon. Ugochinyere, who is also the chairman of the House Committee Downstream Petroleum, at the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital.\n\nOther lawmakers in attendance were: Hon Abdulmalik Danga representing Adavi/Okehi; Dr. Usman Midala (Askira-Uba/Hawul); Hon. Peter Aniekwe (Anambra East/West) and Kama Nkemkanma (Ohaozara/Onicha/Ivo federal constituency).\n\nBefore the meeting went into a closed-door session Obasanjo lamented the country's current economic hardship, noting that Nigeria would need a \"moral rearmament\" to overcome the socio-economic challenges confronting it. He insisted that the nation cannot move forward if there are no changes in the ways and manners in which governance was being administered.\n\nHe pointed out that the calls for a single term of office for the President, one-day nationwide elections, and a power rotation between the North and the South by the lawmakers can only work if upright leaders emerge.\n\nHe insisted that Nigeria will only progress when upright individuals and good role models are in positions of power, emphasising that the number of terms spent in office will only make a difference if the right people are in leadership roles.\n\n\"What I know about Nigeria is that we need to get it right in terms of leadership and the team. The point is that we can overcome these challenges within two and a half years.\n\n\"In another 10 years, we need to consolidate what we have achieved, and in 25 years, we will be there. Our problem is that we take two steps forward and probably two steps backwards, and that won't get us anywhere.\n\n\"For me, it's not just about the system change alone; we need to rethink democracy. We need to reconsider the Western Liberal Democracy model and what can work for Africa that will be home-grown.\n\n\"In the African system, we typically work through consensus. We need to join hands to make things work. If we get it right, whether we have a single six-year term presidency or two four-year terms, we need to work on our mentality.\n\n\"We have to decarbonise our brains. Our main problem is ourselves. We must address our issues before the length of office will matter.\n\n\"If the same people with the same mentality are in power, nothing will change. Our starting point is ourselves,\" the former President added.\n\nEarlier, Ugochinyere, in his remarks, said they were in Abeokuta to confer with the former President on a wide range of national issues and to also express their solidarity with the former President and equally learn from his fountain of extensive knowledge on development and good governance especially at this challenging times.\n\nThe lawmaker said Obasanjo saw the future of the country and worked towards it, having been at the helm of affairs as the President between 1999 and 2007 during which he laid foundations for strong reforms that brought progress.\n\nHe commended the former President for the various reforms implemented under his administration and blamed past governments for not consolidating them in the interest of Nigerians while hoping that the present administration of President Bola Tinubu will find a way to make things work differently.\n\n\"If successive governments had consolidated electricity reforms, foreign policies, civil service reforms, and digital reforms, among other things, today, we would not be facing the economic challenge that is fighting us.\n\n\"If not for the foundation you laid in 1999, things would have been worse, and at that time you were doing it, most people did not see the future of Nigeria. We can see your effort in transforming telecommunication reform in the country. What you did in the civil service reforms, the establishment of anti-corruption agencies,\" he added.\n\nUgochinyere informed Obasanjo that the lawmakers were co-sponsors of Bills seeking a single term of six years for Presidents and governors, power rotation between the northern and southern parts of the country, and one-day elections for presidential, governorship, national assembly, and houses of assembly seats, to eradicate the bandwagon effects.\n\nAlso speaking, Hon. Abdulmalik Danga (Kogi/Adavi/Okehi Federal Constituency of Kogi State) appealed to the ex-president to support the call for rotating power between the North and South across the three senatorial districts of each state. According to him, this would reduce marginalisation and douse ethnic group agitations.\n\n\"I'm suggesting that the rotation of power between North and South can be inculcated into the constitution amendment so that power can be rotated within the three senatorial districts of each state. In my state, for example, Kogi Central (the Ebira people), if not by divine intervention, we've only had just one axis; as I speak, the western axis, the Yoruba-speaking part, has never had it, and we don't know whether it would get to their turn. The same thing is happening in Benue state. We are just pleading with you, the founding fathers, that if this can be looked into, it would douse the agitations of several ethnic groups. Let it be made compulsory that power should rotate within the three senatorial districts of each state,\" the lawmaker pleaded.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title":

Highly regarded former federal prosecutors and law professors go further, saying it could open Alito to charges of perjury and impeachment based on the two letters Alito sent to Congress. Emily Baden, in an interview with Erin Burnett on CNN\u2019s \u2018OutFront\u2019 said that Justice Alito and his wife Martha-Ann while on a walk stopped in front of Baden\u2019s home while she was outside. Martha-Ann Alito and Baden then had a heated exchange over anti-Trump signs Baden had in her yard. Baden said while that happened, Justice Alito \u201cjust kept walking and basically disappeared.\u201d Baden admitted to calling Martha-Ann Alito a profanity during the confrontation and regretting that. The sidewalk altercation happened on February 15, according to Baden and confirmed by a police report. That\u2019s nearly a month after the upside-down U.S. Flag was photographed by The New York Times flying at the Alito\u2019s home on January 17. Emily Baden and her husband have since moved from the neighborhood. At the very least, Justice Alito must remove himself from all Jan. 6 and Trump related cases.", "summary": "In a CNN interview, the neighbor Justice Alito alleged instigated the upside-down U.S. flag flying at his home, said he was \"at best mistaken...at  worst outright lying\" about the timeline of the confrontation and flag flying.", "url": "https://www.cleveland.com/darcy/2024/06/alito-alleged-timeline-lie-flagged-darcy-cartoon.html", "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/SB6WHQVFZZFNHLGMZFRZQC3D7U.jpg?auth=4087770bcd8f68a39f524eb82cfcb2d835d333f8829f7fd8003353238890d669&width=1280&quality=90", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:56:36", "author": "Jeff Darcy", "authors": ["Jeff Darcy"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.522}

He's just the better fighter anyway, at least by looking at the quality of recent competition.\n\nRobert Whittaker faces off against Ikram Aliskerov in the main event for UFC Fight Night betting this Saturday from Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. Whittaker was originally supposed to fight Khamzat Chimaev at this event but with Chimaev withdrawing due to an illness, Aliskerov was shifted from last week's card.\n\nUFC odds have the former title challenger Whittaker installed as a -145 favorite with the fast-rising Aliskerov coming back at +125. Here are my best free UFC Fight Night: Whittaker vs. Aliskerov picks and predictions for June 22.\n\nAliskerov has three first-round finishes in three trips to the octagon but this is a massive step up in competition. He earned a UFC contract with a Contender Series win against Mario Sousa two years ago but Sousa is clearly not a UFC-caliber fighter.\n\nAliskerov starched Phil Hawes in the first round of his UFC debut but Hawes has been knocked out in four of his last five fights. In his most recent bout, Aliskerov knocked out Warlley Alves, who is 2-6 in his last eight with four of those losses coming inside the distance. The toughest opponent that Aliskerov has ever faced was ironically, Chimaev at Brave CF back in 2019, and Khamzat knocked him out cold in two minutes.\n\nNow Aliskerov takes on Whittaker who has gone 14-3 over the last decade with his only defeats during that span coming against former champion Israel Adesanya and current champ Dricus du Plessis.\n\nThere is some concern with the damage that Whittaker has absorbed in his career but he proved that his chin is still solid in his last fight when he ate a spinning head kick from Paulo Costa in the opening round and went on to dismantle him the rest of the way.\n\nExpect Whittaker to weather the early storm from Aliskerov and use his more technical kickboxing and experience to pull away in the later rounds.\n\nWhile both of these fighters have only nine days to prepare for each other, the adjustment should be much easier for Whittaker. He was training to fight a highly-dangerous grappler with knockout power in Chimaev so it won't take much to adjust to a finisher with a combat sambo background like Aliskerov.\n\nOn the other hand, Aliskerov was a -1,300 favorite against a BJJ specialist in Antonio Trocoli last weekend. Trocoli was going to be making his promotional debut after a 31-month absence from the sport and was moving down to middleweight after fighting at 205 for most of his career. Suffice to say, facing a well-rounded UFC veteran like Whittaker is a massive change from a tomato can like Trocoli.\n\nIn addition, Aliskerov will now be fighting in a five-round main event after previously preparing for a three-round bout. Aliskerov has never gone past 15 minutes and his last three fights ended inside the first round.\n\nWhittaker is a cardio machine that knows how to control the pace and has fought in several 25-minute fights. With Whittaker's last seven wins coming by decision, grab that prop at big plus money.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikram_Aliskerov", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ikram Aliskerov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Whittaker_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Whittaker (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khamzat_Chimaev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Khamzat Chimaev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Hawes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Hawes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dricus_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dricus du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brave_Combat_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brave Combat Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlley_Alves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warlley Alves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Adesanya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel Adesanya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_jiu-jitsu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazilian jiu-jitsu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickboxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kickboxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerobic exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grappling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambo_(martial_art)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sambo (martial art)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/7882b1f8-978f-463e-a34e-9e4ddd0e4d83.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669095", "eventUri": "eng-9669095", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 766, "textEnd": 773}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

If Whittaker loses, he could begin to dip significantly in the rankings.\n\nWhittaker is currently ranked No. 3 and potentially two wins away from a chance to regain his title. A loss to Aliskerov could delay his pursuit. He's 33, so he's not yet on the wrong side of 35, but time is beginning to be a factor in his ability to perform at his best.\n\nThe co-main event is a potentially explosive heavyweight clash between two Russian contenders. Sergei Pavlovich faces veteran Alexander Volkov. Pavlovich is looking to rebound from a first-round KO loss to Tom Aspinall in a battle for the interim heavyweight title.\n\nVolkov was supposed to fight Jailton Almeida at UFC 302, but he was moved to this card to match up with Pavlovich.

Today, he takes a closer look at the UFC on ABC 6 main event between former middleweight champion Robert Whittaker and short-notice opponent Ikram Aliskerov.\n\nFeb 17, 2024; Anaheim, California, USA; Robert Whittaker lands a jab against Paulo Costa during UFC 298 at Honda Center. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe main event in Saudi Arabia features an impromptu middleweight matchup between two talented fighters who aren't afraid to use their jab.\n\nComing from a traditional martial arts base, Robert Whittaker has developed into one of the most unique striking stylists at 185 pounds.\n\nUsing a combination of speed, accuracy and a fluid economy of movement, the Australian will deceptively blitz off different angles. Like many karate-based strikers, Whittaker will feint or show a certain speed to draw his opponent into a false sense of security, only to disrupt the perceived timing with off-beat strikes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DanTomMMA/status/1382169527027261440\n\nAs we've seen in multiple fights, Whittaker often will assert himself through rear-legged front kicks that he uses to launch himself into variations of left hooks and shifting overhand shots. The former champ also has no issue when it comes to sticking to his fundamentals, building offense off of deceptive jabs and feints.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DanTomMMA/status/1397627348489424896\n\nThat said, Whittaker is not beyond being taxed for his sometimes low-handed approach and will need to be on his best behavior opposite a competitor like Ikram Aliskerov.\n\nDespite coming from an extensive sambo background, Aliskerov has steadily been improving his striking for those paying attention.\n\nSmartly prioritizing his lead hand, Aliskerov plies a deceptively effective jab at range. The 31-year-old will occasionally play off his jab, offering up change-ups in the form of hook-cross combinations.\n\nWhen feeling in Stride, Aliskerov will attach kicks or knees to his combos, working particularly well off his lead side. Although Aliskerov's offerings off of the lead side should serve him well on paper, the Dagestani's A-game is arguably on the ground.\n\nIkram Aliskerov def. Warlley Alves, UFC 294\n\nConsidering Aliskerov's grappling prowess, no one should be shocked if the Dagestani fighter attempts to take this party to the floor this Saturday.\n\nA world and European champion in sambo, Aliskerov is no stranger to closed-quarter combat. Like many high-level operators out of Dagestan, Aliskerov does his best work from the clinch - a place where he can chain to and from takedown attempts.\n\nWhether Aliserkov is working from bodylock positions or single-leg variations, the 12-year pro doesn't seem to be short on ideas in this space. Aliskerov also keeps solid reactive takedown shots in his back pocket, which could come in handy against a blitzing \"Bobby Knuckles.\"\n\nThat said, Whittaker has proven to be much more difficult to ground than many presumed.\n\nAside from the fact that Whittaker's footwork makes it difficult for his opponents to set up their shots, the Australian also shows the small technical intricacies that make him hard to ground or hold down when grasped.\n\nFor example, while most fighters are reliant on more traditional defenses such as sprawls or battles for under-hooks, they typically end up losing out to superior grapplers since these defensive tactics involve a commitment to contact (which in turn begets more grappling).\n\nWhereas Whittaker, though capable of using those defenses, does not rely on them. Instead, \"The Reaper\" prefers to head off takedown attempts at the pass.\n\nAlready possessing a strong base and balance, Whittaker's hip and grip awareness also have improved through the years.\n\nNot only does Whittaker utilize grip breaks and wrist controls, but the 33-year-old is also disciplined about consistently circling out to his opponent's weak side, which helps dissuade re-shots and takedown chain adjustments from his foes. Even Romero had difficulty grasping or chaining off his initial attempts due to Whittaker's persistence to fight hands.\n\nWhat is even more impressive is Whittaker's ability to go from thwarting takedown attempts to striking off the breaks, something that will also likely keep Aliskerov honest in exchanges with him.\n\nStill, if Whittaker does find himself on the bottom in this fight, the Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt will need to be extra careful with his propensity to look for underhook getups given Aliskerov's knack for finding kimuras.\n\nDespite the oddsmakers opening this fight at a pick'em, public money has come in the former champion, listing Whittaker -154 and Aliskerov +120 via FanDuel.\n\nANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 17: Robert Whittaker of New Zealand celebrates defeating Paulo Costa of Brazil in their middleweight fight during UFC 298 at Honda Center on February 17, 2024 in Anaheim, California. (Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images)\n\nConsidering that Whittaker is a much more proven product on paper, I can completely understand the early enthusiasm for bettors backing the Australian in this spot.\n\nThat said, I stand by my initial feeling that Aliskerov is a deceptively trickier task than Whittaker's original opponent - Khamzat Chimaev - from a stylistic perspective.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Chimaev offers a hell of an early storm to weather on paper, but Whittaker has traditionally done well against aggressive, grapple-heavy fighters.\n\nAliskerov, however, offers a much different ask given that the Dagestani fighter is more fundamentally sound than Chimaev and appears to be able to fight at a solid pace for three rounds. Moreover, Aliskerov is among the handful of decent jabber in the division, which could pay some potential dividends considering the success Costa had when jabbing in Whittaker's last fight.\n\nBut between Aliskerov's inexperience at this level and the fact that last week's shakeup affects him more with the multiple weight cuts compounded with travel at hand, I can't help but side with the speed and savvy of Whittaker.\n\nI believe that Whittaker can have success with his kicks at distance and timing change-ups in close, potentially producing his first finish since 2017. The pick is Whittaker by knockout in Round 3.\n\nAs the main event, Whittaker and Aliskerov are expected to make their walks to the octagon at approximately 5 p.m. ET. The fight broadcasts live on ABC and streams on ESPN+.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Whittaker was originally to fight the undefeated Chimaev, but an illness forced Chimaev out of the contest, which led to the matchmakers pulling Aliskerov out of last weekend's UFC Vegas 93 co-main event and inserting him into the Whittaker fight.\n\nMuch was made of what it could mean for Whittaker to be the first to beat Chimaev and whether he'd earn another shot at UFC gold, but Whittaker is focused solely on the lesser known Aliskerov.\n\n\"My biggest concern was making sure that the fight happened, was going through with the fight,\" Whittaker said at UFC Saudi Arabia media day. \"My biggest concern now is beating Ikram.\"\n\n\"He's very much a dangerous opponent,\" he continued. \"You can look at it on paper that he might be more dangerous [than Chimaev] because of how well-rounded he is, but honestly, every fight brings a level of threat and a level of danger that has to be addressed.\"\n\nChimaev and Aliskerov actually fought one another in 2019, a year before Chimaev burst onto the UFC scene. That Brave Combat Federation encounter was brief, but competitive, with Chimaev eventually prevailing via knockout.\n\nSince that time, Chimaev's star has continued to rise, and he'd likely have earned a title shot by now at either welterweight or middleweight were it not for health problems that have repeatedly caused the fighter to withdraw from bouts. Whittaker isn't disappointed that he's the latest to miss out on a fight with Chimaev, and he feels there's a lot his team did in camp that will apply to his replacement foe.\n\n\"I'm not really worried about it too much, who I'm fighting, I'm going to be honest,\" Whittaker said. \"I'm here to fight. I was fit, I was ready, and this is how I provide for my family. Everyone knew I wanted to fight. I'm here, so I'm going to fight.\"\n\n\"By this stage in the camp, all the work's been done,\" he continued. \"I'm fit, I'm strong, I'm sharp, and all the skills that I worked for Chimaev, no skill is wasted, no skill is useless. A lot of it can be used in this fight, so all the work's been done. I'm ready.\"\n\nA win over Chimaev would have firmly pushed Whittaker to the front of the middleweight contenders' line, where he would await the winner of the UFC 305 headliner between champion Dricus du Plessis and Israel Adesanya. Both fighters hold wins over Whittaker, but the former champion has recently knocked off ranked opponents Paulo Costa and Marvin Vettori.\n\nChimaev is out of the picture for the foreseeable future and there's no guarantee a win over Aliskerov holds the same weight in the eyes of the fans nor the UFC. Regardless, Whittaker expects victory to bring the proper spoils, whether that's a title shot or another chance to fight Chimaev.\n\n\"The only sure thing in the UFC is that winning opens doors,\" Whittaker said. \"My focus is solely on this Saturday night, getting my hand raised, and I'll worry about the rest afterwards.\"\n\n\"If [Chimaev is] around at the top of the game and I'm around at the top of the game, our paths will cross,\" he continued. \"I don't have any particular opponents that I look to fight. It's just they give me a name and I say yes and then we're here.\"", "source": {"uri": "mmafighting.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MMA Fighting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexander_k_lee@mmafighting.com", "name": "Alexander K.

Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe main event in Saudi Arabia features an impromptu middleweight matchup between two talented fighters who aren't afraid to use their jab.\n\nComing from a traditional martial arts base, Robert Whittaker has developed into one of the most unique striking stylists at 185 pounds.\n\nUsing a combination of speed, accuracy and a fluid economy of movement, the Australian will deceptively blitz off different angles. Like many karate-based strikers, Whittaker will feint or show a certain speed to draw his opponent into a false sense of security, only to disrupt the perceived timing with off-beat strikes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DanTomMMA/status/1382169527027261440\n\nAs we've seen in multiple fights, Whittaker often will assert himself through rear-legged front kicks that he uses to launch himself into variations of left hooks and shifting overhand shots. The former champ also has no issue when it comes to sticking to his fundamentals, building offense off of deceptive jabs and feints.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DanTomMMA/status/1397627348489424896\n\nThat said, Whittaker is not beyond being taxed for his sometimes low-handed approach and will need to be on his best behavior opposite a competitor like Ikram Aliskerov.\n\nDespite coming from an extensive sambo background, Aliskerov has steadily been improving his striking for those paying attention.\n\nSmartly prioritizing his lead hand, Aliskerov plies a deceptively effective jab at range. The 31-year-old will occasionally play off his jab, offering up change-ups in the form of hook-cross combinations.\n\nWhen feeling in Stride, Aliskerov will attach kicks or knees to his combos, working particularly well off his lead side. Although Aliskerov's offerings off of the lead side should serve him well on paper, the Dagestani's A-game is arguably on the ground.\n\nRobert Whittaker vs. Ikram Aliskerov breakdown: Potential grappling threats\n\nIkram Aliskerov def. Warlley Alves, UFC 294\n\nConsidering Aliskerov's grappling prowess, no one should be shocked if the Dagestani fighter attempts to take this party to the floor this Saturday.\n\nA world and European champion in sambo, Aliskerov is no stranger to closed-quarter combat. Like many high-level operators out of Dagestan, Aliskerov does his best work from the clinch - a place where he can chain to and from takedown attempts.\n\nWhether Aliserkov is working from bodylock positions or single-leg variations, the 12-year pro doesn't seem to be short on ideas in this space. Aliskerov also keeps solid reactive takedown shots in his back pocket, which could come in handy against a blitzing \"Bobby Knuckles.\"\n\nThat said, Whittaker has proven to be much more difficult to ground than many presumed.\n\nAside from the fact that Whittaker's footwork makes it difficult for his opponents to set up their shots, the Australian also shows the small technical intricacies that make him hard to ground or hold down when grasped.\n\nFor example, while most fighters are reliant on more traditional defenses such as sprawls or battles for under-hooks, they typically end up losing out to superior grapplers since these defensive tactics involve a commitment to contact (which in turn begets more grappling).\n\nWhereas Whittaker, though capable of using those defenses, does not rely on them. Instead, \"The Reaper\" prefers to head off takedown attempts at the pass.\n\nAlready possessing a strong base and balance, Whittaker's hip and grip awareness also have improved through the years.\n\nNot only does Whittaker utilize grip breaks and wrist controls, but the 33-year-old is also disciplined about consistently circling out to his opponent's weak side, which helps dissuade re-shots and takedown chain adjustments from his foes. Even Romero had difficulty grasping or chaining off his initial attempts due to Whittaker's persistence to fight hands.\n\nWhat is even more impressive is Whittaker's ability to go from thwarting takedown attempts to striking off the breaks, something that will also likely keep Aliskerov honest in exchanges with him.\n\nStill, if Whittaker does find himself on the bottom in this fight, the Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt will need to be extra careful with his propensity to look for underhook getups given Aliskerov's knack for finding kimuras.\n\nRobert Whittaker vs. Ikram Aliskerov odds\n\nDespite the oddsmakers opening this fight at a pick'em, public money has come in the former champion, listing Whittaker -154 and Aliskerov +120 via FanDuel.\n\nRobert Whittaker vs. Ikram Aliskerov prediction, pick\n\nANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 17: Robert Whittaker of New Zealand celebrates defeating Paulo Costa of Brazil in their middleweight fight during UFC 298 at Honda Center on February 17, 2024 in Anaheim, California. (Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images)\n\nConsidering that Whittaker is a much more proven product on paper, I can completely understand the early enthusiasm for bettors backing the Australian in this spot.\n\nThat said, I stand by my initial feeling that Aliskerov is a deceptively trickier task than Whittaker's original opponent - Khamzat Chimaev - from a stylistic perspective.\n\nDon't get me wrong: Chimaev offers a hell of an early storm to weather on paper, but Whittaker has traditionally done well against aggressive, grapple-heavy fighters.\n\nAliskerov, however, offers a much different ask given that the Dagestani fighter is more fundamentally sound than Chimaev and appears to be able to fight at a solid pace for three rounds. Moreover, Aliskerov is among the handful of decent jabber in the division, which could pay some potential dividends considering the success Costa had when jabbing in Whittaker's last fight.\n\nBut between Aliskerov's inexperience at this level and the fact that last week's shakeup affects him more with the multiple weight cuts compounded with travel at hand, I can't help but side with the speed and savvy of Whittaker.\n\nI believe that Whittaker can have success with his kicks at distance and timing change-ups in close, potentially producing his first finish since 2017. The pick is Whittaker by knockout in Round 3.\n\nPrediction: Whittaker inside the distance Robert Whittaker vs. Ikram Aliskerov start time, where to watch\n\nAs the main event, Whittaker and Aliskerov are expected to make their walks to the octagon at approximately 5 p.m. ET. The fight broadcasts live on ABC and streams on ESPN+.\n\nFor more on the card, visit MMA Junkie's event hub for UFC on ABC 6.", "source": {"uri": "mmajunkie.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news",

Especially now, skillset wise I understand the threat and the danger that he poses to me.\n\n\"But I believe I'm better across the board and there's a reason I'm ranked #3 and a previous middleweight champion - and he's going to find out.\"\n\nDespite being ranked in the top 5 and coming off an impressive decision win over Paulo Costa earlier in the year, Whittaker acknowledged that he'll never feel the pressure of a UFC main event dissipate.\n\n\"The fear of performing well is massive, it doesn't change, and it doesn't get easier,\" he explained, before sending an ominous message to Aliskerov: \"I'll deal with it how I always do and come Saturday; I'm going hunting... No pressure, no diamonds.\"\n\nWhittaker certainly needs to go head-hunting if he's to deliver the statement win that he desires, with his last knockout victory coming all the way back in 2017 against Ronaldo Souza - his seven wins since that bout have all come via the judges' scorecards.\n\nYet 'The Reaper' expanded on this ferocious gameplan at the pre-fight press conference, in which he noted that \"as much as it's a sport, it's a combat sport,\" where respect goes out the window as soon as the cage door locks behind him.\n\n\"We're two warriors going in there and we're going to really test our metal. The idea is to be in there and be the hunter, and just hunt him down, and hurt him, and hurt him [again] until he goes away, is very much the gameplan.\"\n\nWhilst a dominant decision win, or viral knockout, over the highly touted Khamzat Chimaev would have undoubtedly seen the Australian re-enter the title picture in a big way, defeating the unranked Aliskerov is more about maintaining strength of schedule.\n\n\"The middleweight division is full of opportunity, it's dynamic and flowing,\" he shared, with the 185lb title up for grabs in just a few months' time when champion Dricus du Plessis returns to action to face Israel Adesanya at UFC 305.\n\n\"Winning opens doors, and I'm looking forward to getting over Ikram.\n\n\"The only sure thing in the UFC is that winning opens doors, and my focus is solely on this Saturday night and getting my hand raised - I'll worry about the rest afterwards.\"\n\nInterestingly, should Whittaker get his hand raised and take minimal damage, there could be a chance that he steps back into the training room on short order in order to align himself as the backup fighter for the upcoming title bout.\n\nThat bout, which had been rumored ever since the South African wrestled away the title from Sean Strickland in February 2024, was finally confirmed earlier this week following a 'War Room' leak.\n\nIf a backup option fails to materialize, there's always the option to face Strickland himself later in the year; with a win there likely securing another shot at reclaiming his undisputed middleweight title.\n\nRobert Whittaker vs Ikram Aliskerov is your new main event of UFC Saudi Arabia, scheduled for June 22 live from the Kingdom Arena in Riyadh.", "source": {"uri": "bloodyelbow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bloody Elbow"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Whittaker_(fighter)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Whittaker (fighter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikram_Aliskerov", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ikram Aliskerov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronaldo_Souza", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronaldo Souza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Combat sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khamzat_Chimaev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Khamzat Chimaev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dricus_du_Plessis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dricus du Plessis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Strickland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Strickland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Adesanya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Adesanya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middleweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Backup", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloodyelbow.com/wp-content/uploads/1/2024/06/GettyImages-2158297587-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9669095", "eventUri": "eng-9669095", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 3622, "textEnd": 3629}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

He will now face Ikram Aliskerov, an unranked middleweight, whom many, including Renato Moicano, feel is a tougher matchup for \"The Reaper.\"\n\nAliserkov won first-round finishes in his two fights in the UFC. Moreover, he has only lost once in MMA to Khamzat Chimaev at UFC Brave CF 23. Even though he won a first-round knockout, it was Chimaev's most challenging fight before he joined the UFC.\n\nRenato Moicano and Gilbert Burns are hosts of the Show Me The Money podcast. The latest podcast episode previewed the fight between Ikram Aliskerov and Robert Whittaker. Both, particularly Moicano, were high on Aliskerov's chances of springing an upset.\n\n\"If you watch the fight, Khamzat Chimaev versus Ikram Aliskerov before the knockout, Chimaev tried several takedowns and the guy was just defending. If you look at his grappling, yeah, I think he could be even better than Chimaev in grappling. I think that's going to be a hard fight for Robert Whittaker,\" said Moicano on the podcast.\n\nGilbert Burns also agreed with the assessment. Burns pointed out that Aliskerov's fight against Chimaev was at 180 lbs. He felt Aliskerov would have extra energy in a 185-fight against Whittaker, thus having an advantage.\n\nBurns also revealed he saw Aliskerov sparring with Johnny Eblen, the Bellator middleweight champion.

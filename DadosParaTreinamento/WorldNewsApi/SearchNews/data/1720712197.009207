Cllr Secas was elected on the third count, as she got surplus 35 votes bringing her total to 1,636 and past the quota. \u201cI\u2019m delighted, I\u2019m overwhelmed,\u201d Cllr Secas said. \u201cI would like to thank every single person who voted for me and my family for their support, understanding and patience, especially in the last few months. \u201cI would also like to thank my campaigners, the people who support me and especially Thomas Hannon, who has been out with me almost every single time since the very beginning of my campaign.\u201d Transfer-friendly candidate Cllr Secas was surprisingly low in tallies for the first while on Saturday, but got a late-night push later Saturday evening. Despite this, she missed out on making the quota by 31 votes. This is the third time around that Cllr Secas was elected, as she narrowly missed out on being elected in 2009. She gets the fourth seat for the Limerick City East constituency, behind that of poll-topper Cllr Catherine Slattery, newcomer Cllr Peter Doyle and Fianna Fail\u2019s Cllr Joe Pond.", "summary": "<table><tr><td><img src=\"https://www.limerickleader.ie/resizer/300/200/true/2024_06_09/ilim_Elena_Secas_elected_9-6-24-1717937436924.jpg--.jpg?1717937441013\" alt=\"\" align=\"left\" />LABOUR councillor Elena Secas is celebrating reelection for Limerick City East as she missed out on quota.

It started out with me having that intention of going back to how it started for me, which was just sitting with myself and really getting back to that first passion of songwriting. Nerding out over references and artists and poetry -- whatever -- and really tapping into that.\"\n\nCabello's most recent album, Familia, arrived in April 2022. Where that album focused on complex heartbreak, C, XOXO will shake up perceptions of the singer. \"I'm always scheming but I won't say too much about it because I love a calculated surprise,\" she told Rolling Stone in November 2023, adding: \"It always has to be about challenging myself and doing something new. So really consuming a lot of new art and a lot of new references. A lot of new music, new movies, new novels, new photography. To me, what produces different output is having new input. That's what's inspired me.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "larisha_paul@rollingstone.com", "name": "Larisha Paul", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOXO_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "XOXO (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camila_Cabello", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camila Cabello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Luv_It_(Psy_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "I Luv It (Psy song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_Girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gossip Girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboi_Carti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playboi Carti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_Her_Daddy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Call Her Daddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/camila-cabello-album-announcement.jpg?crop=0px%2C19px%2C1798px%2C1015px&resize=1600%2C900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543993", "eventUri": "eng-9543993", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 161, "textEnd": 168}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

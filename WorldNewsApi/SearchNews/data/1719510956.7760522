It\u2019s the third time an IPL final is going to be played between top two teams in the points table. Two-time champions KKR have beaten 2016 winners SRH twice in this IPL season \u2013 once in the league stage and in Qualifier 1 respectively. Sunday\u2019s final is being played on a red-soil pitch, with 63m and 70m square boundaries, along with a straight boundary at 77m. It is the pitch where Punjab Kings beat Chennai Super Kings by seven wickets on May 1. After winning the toss, Cummins said Shahbaz Ahmed takes Abdul Samad\u2019s place in the playing eleven. \u201cLooks like a good wicket, played on a different wicket the other night. There was no dew on the other night\u2019s game, but when it does, it\u2019s very damaging.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve had now dew the other night, I don\u2019t feel there\u2019ll be any today, I want to have a crack with the bat first. We have a style that doesn\u2019t work always, but when it does work, it\u2019s very damaging. We have done well defending scores,\u201d he said. KKR skipper Shreyas Iyer, leading a side in an IPL final for the second time, said they have bowled first on winning the toss and his playing eleven is unchanged from their Qualifier 1 win over SRH in Ahmedabad earlier this week. KKR have been unbeaten while chasing in IPL 2024. \u201cWe\u2019ll get a fair idea about how the pitch will play. It\u2019s a red soil and we played our last game on a similar surface. We need to stay with the present, stick to the basics and execute all our plans. Every individual is taking responsibility, this is a big game, we\u2019ve plenty of people who\u2019re playing in a final for the first time, nervous, but this is also a good chance,\u201d he said.

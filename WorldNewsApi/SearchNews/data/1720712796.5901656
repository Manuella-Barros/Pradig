Baby was re-elected to represent Tallaght South this afternoon on the fifth count, surpassing the 1,257-vote quota this afternoon. His son, Britto, is a first time candidate and was elected to neighbouring Tallaght Central on the ninth count, two hours later. It is the first time a Fine Gael candidate has been elected to the area for nearly 20 years. Speaking to reporters on the family\u2019s result, the pair said they were delighted to win their seats and looked forward to representing the Tallaght area for the next five years. \u201cWe are very happy,\u201d Baby Pereppadan said. \u201cWe have worked very hard these last couple of months, he\u2019s working full time and I\u2019m a full-time councillor for five years.\u201d \u201cWe got a very good response from nearly all the houses. We are very happy\u201d Speaking on his first campaign, Britto Pereppadan said: \u201cI was selected on the third of July last year at the Fine Gael selection convention to run as a candidate in Tallaght Central. \u201cSince then, I\u2019ve really been at it. I\u2019ve been working hard over the last ten or eleven months. So I\u2019m really grateful and privileged for the result. \u201cWe\u2019ve been putting the hours in, whether it\u2019s after work or over the weekend. Whenever we got a chance we were getting involved in the community and speak with many people, knock on doors, hand leaflets out. We\u2019ve been going all out so I\u2019m really happy with this result\u201d he added. The family have been based in Tallaght for over 20 years and Baby has been contesting elections since 2009, winning for the first time in 2019. Today, we won his first election beside his son. Baby said: \u201cThis is a special occasion, especially because it\u2019s a father and son elected on the same day in different constituencies and very different areas.\u201d The father-son councillors are just two of the many Fine Gael candidates contesting this year\u2019s local election, around Dublin, who come from a migrant background. Speaking to Newstalk yesterday, former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar name-checked them both, adding that for every \u201cfar-right Twitter warrior who\u2019s going to get elected, there\u2019ll be at least one Fine Gael migrant-background candidate in Dublin elected\u201d.

You do get the odd racist comments out at the door, but I mean, you\u2019re seeing two hundred, three hundred people a day \u2013 every single day \u2013 so I would generally say it\u2019s been the minority,\u201d Britto said. \u201cYou just have to give it your best. It is an area where we haven\u2019t had a Fine Gael seat in the last 20 years, so I think that I\u2019m very privileged that the people have entrusted me to represent them on a county level. \u201cI\u2019ll give it my best shot, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d he added. Father and son FG candidates, Baby and Britto Pereppperdan, have both been elected to South Dublin County Council. @thejournal_ie pic.twitter.com/0AN4AT8VVY\u2014 Muiris O\u2019Cearbhaill (@muirisoc) June 9, 2024 Voters are still being counted at Weston Airport in Dublin. Palmerstown-Fonthill is the only remaining ward in South Dublin County Council where no candidate has reached the quota of 1,616. Just one candidate has been elected to the tightly-contested seven-seater Clondalkin ward so far, independent incumbent Francis Timmons, surpassing the quota of 1,601. While People Before Profit\u2019s candidate Darragh Adelaide sits currently on 1,277 votes after the eight count, and will most likely take the second seat, it\u2019s unclear which candidate will be first past the quote to take one of the remaining five seats. There are five candidates who have recieved around 1,100 votes after the eighth count, including Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s William Carey, Independent Ireland\u2019s Linda De Courcy, Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s Trevor Gilligan, Social Democrats\u2019 Eoin \u00d3 Broin, and Fine Gael\u2019s Shirley O\u2019Hara.", "summary": "Baby and Britto Pereppadan were elected to Tallaght South and Tallaght Central, respectively.", "url": "https://www.thejournal.ie/baby-and-britto-win-seats-tallaght-6403442-Jun2024/", "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6403442/river/?height=400&version=6403771", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:14:30", "author": "View All Articles", "authors": ["View All Articles"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.064}

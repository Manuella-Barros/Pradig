{"id": 232029220, "title": "NFL Rumors: Zach Wilson in 'Positive State of Mind' with Broncos, In the Mix for QB1", "text": "The Denver Broncos may have drafted Bo Nix in the first round and have Jarrett Stidham returning, but Zach Wilson is reportedly making a name for himself this offseason as well. \"They're trying to regain his confidence again. I'm told he's in a positive state of mind,\" ESPN's Jeremy Fowler said of Wilson. The Broncos traded for Wilson in April as part of a swap of late-round picks. Wilson spent his first three NFL seasons with the New York Jets, putting himself on the shortlist of worst first-round quarterbacks of this generation. The BYU product threw for 6,293 yards and 23 touchdowns against 25 interceptions with the Jets, compiling a 12-21 record as a starter. Fowler said Wilson is \"in the mix\" as the Broncos try to determine their Week 1 starter. Denver used the No. 12 overall pick on Nix in April's draft, and the Oregon product should get a long look at earning the job. Nix has reportedly been impressive in camp as well, and at age 24, he's just a few months younger than Wilson, who already has three years of NFL experience. Stidham started the final two games of the 2023 regular season and does have the advantage of spending a full year in Sean Payton's system. The 27-year-old threw for 496 yards and two touchdowns against an interception while leading the Broncos to a 1-1 record. \"It's kind of the orphan group. They're all orphan dogs,\" Payton told reporters last month. \"They've come from somewhere but they're doing good. It's a good room. One's coming from college, one's coming from two or three NFL systems and the other is coming from one system. They're all in a race to learn this system. I would say ... man, they're doing well.\"", "summary": "The Denver Broncos may have drafted Bo Nix in the first round and have Jarrett Stidham returning, but Zach Wilson is reportedly making a name for himself this\u2026", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10124127-nfl-rumors-zach-wilson-in-positive-state-of-mind-with-broncos-in-the-mix-for-qb1", "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/v1717941736/caz3mftbhldkeo7hkhyt.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:11:33", "author": "Tyler Conway", "authors": ["Tyler Conway"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.015}

Cody Rhodes revealed the idea that he'd have been okay with stepping aside for WrestleMania 40, so The Rock could face Roman Reigns at the event is \"nonsense.\" Below are some highlights (via Fightful):\n\nCody Rhodes on The Rock being a pro wrestler: \"I grew up a huge fan of The Rock. I have a lot of respect for The Rock. Maybe more than anybody in any locker room. When I made eye contact with The Rock for the very first piece of business we ever did, I got an instant understanding of who he is. He's not a movie star. He's not a potential Presidential nominee, which would be great at this point. He's not a businessman with all these partnerships. When I looked at him in the eyes, I saw exactly what he is. He's a pro wrestler. He's a pro wrestler who understands the nature, 'I like this crowd. I'm going to get them really excited. Then really upset. Then as excited as they've ever been. Then I'm going to get them to tell their friends to come back.'\"\n\nOn his respect for The Rock: \"At that moment, I had the utmost respect for him because in my heart, that's how I feel. I could do a bazillion other things, but I'm a wrestler. To see that from the biggest movie star on the planet, it's a lot of respect.\"\n\nOn the idea that he'd be \"okay\" with stepping aside for The Rock at WrestleMania 40: \"Where we would butt heads is in the idea that you could just come back in the midst of a story that was taking place and just because you're The Rock, you can step into the starting lineup and take WrestleMania for yourself. A lot of people said, 'He's The Rock. He can do whatever he wants.' I saw a podcast with two wrestling heads talking and they said, 'I'm sure Cody is fine stepping aside for WrestleMania and doing it later in the year.' In my mind, I'm thinking, 'That's insane.' That's the Super Bowl of what we do. The last day of WrestleMania, the last match, it's our literal Super Bowl. The idea that somebody thought I would be cool with it. They don't know me. That's nonsense. I worked my whole life for this. Rock should know I wouldn't be cool with it. Maybe that's an understanding him and I have. He found out, I'm not cool with it. That's a good thing. You know who wasn't cool with The Rock? Steve Austin. They made magic together. They rubbed together so much it created diamonds. I do have a lot of respect for him.\"\n\nUltimately, Cody Rhodes did face Roman Reigns in the main event of WrestleMania 40: Night 2, beating Reigns to become the new WWE Undisputed Champion. Cody will also be in action this weekend at WWE Money in the Bank 2024, teaming with Randy Orton and Kevin Owens against three members of The Bloodline.

Instead, the \"Cody Crybabies\" stirred things up, leading to a major two-night event where Cody finally got his moment at the end of the second night.\n\nCody Rhodes recently shared his thoughts about heading into WWE WrestleMania XL. The Rock and Roman Reigns teamed up against Rhodes and Seth Rollins in the main event of night one, where the bad guys won. The next night, Rhodes defeated Reigns to claim the Undisputed WWE Universal Title, with The Rock and others getting involved.\n\nIn an interview with The Pivot Podcast, Rhodes discussed WrestleMania XL.

However, The Rock returned in January and pushed for a singles match with Reigns, postponing Rhodes' match with Reigns. Now, Cody vs. The Rock is being planned for WrestleMania 41, depending on Rock's schedule.\n\nThe Rock has announced his return to WWE, citing his new board role as a factor that will make it easier for him to get what he wants.

The company shifted back to the rematch between Rhodes and Reigns when fans led the \"We Want Cody\" movement. Rhodes then beat Reigns for the title at WWE WrestleMania 40.\n\nSpeaking on The Pivot Podcast, Cody Rhodes shared his thoughts on The Rock and noted that he had respected him because he was a wrestler at heart.\n\n\"I grew up a huge fan of The Rock. I have a lot of respect for The Rock,\" Cody Rhodes said. \"Maybe more then anybody in any locker room because I made eye contact with The Rock for the very first piece of business we ever did, I got an instant understanding of who he is. He's not movie star, he's not potential presidential nominee, which would be great at this point, I'm all about anything else. He's not this businessman with all these partnerships. When I looked at him in the eyes, I saw exactly what he is. He's a pro wrestler.\n\n\"He's a pro wrestler who understands the nature of, I'd like this crowd to be really excited, then I'm going to get them really upset, then I'm going to get them as excited as they've ever been, then I'm going to get them telling their friends to come back. So in that moment, I had the utmost respect for him. Because in my heart, that's how I feel. I could do a bazillion other things, but I'm a wrestler. That's what I am, and to see that from the biggest movie star on the planet, a lot of respect.\"\n\nCody Rhodes continued by saying that he and The Rock didn't see eye to eye with the idea that The Rock could come back and take WrestleMania for himself. He stated that the idea that he would be cool with stepping aside was insane.\n\n\"Where we could butt heads is in the idea that you could just come back in the midst of a story that was taking place and just because you're The Rock, you can step into the starting lineup and take WrestleMania for yourself,\" Cody Rhodes said. \"A lot of people will say, 'He's The Rock, he can do whatever he wants.' I even saw this really fun podcast with two wrestling heads talking back and forth and they said, 'I'm sure Cody's fine stepping aside for WrestleMania and then doing it later in the year.' In my mind, I'm thinking, that's insane. That's the Super Bowl for what we do.\n\n\"To get to the Sunday, the last day of WrestleMania, the last match, is our Super Bowl. I used to be financially, to get to that match was the big money match, when the pay was all different. The idea that somebody thought I would just be cool with it, they don't know me. That's nonsense.\"\n\nCody Rhodes then said that The Rock should have known that he would not be cool with it. However, he noted that sometimes not being on the same page led to making magic.\n\n\"I've worked my whole life for this. Rock should know I wouldn't be cool with it. I think maybe that's an understanding that him and I had, he found out I'm not cool with it,\" Cody Rhodes said. \"That's a good thing. Because you know who wasn't cool with The Rock was Steve Austin, and they made magic together. They rubbed together so much, they created diamonds, they made magic together.

The next night, Rhodes won the Undisputed WWE Universal Title from Reigns. The Rock and others got involved.\n\nOriginally, Rhodes was going to take on Reigns for the title after winning the Undisputed WWE Title with no involvement from The Rock, but The Rock returned in January and pushed behind the scenes for a singles match with Reigns, where Rhodes would have to have his bout with Reigns at a later date. Cody vs. The Rock is in the works after WWE teased it on the post-WrestleMania edition of Raw as WWE hopes to do the match at WrestleMania 41 as long as Rock's schedule allows it.\n\nWhile speaking with The Pivot Podcast, Rhodes discussed the situation with WrestleMania XL.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nCody Rhodes headlined both nights of WrestleMania 40 earlier this year, as his rivalry with Roman Reigns and The Bloodline faction evolved into a feud with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson.\n\nAt one point, despite Rhodes earning a shot at the WWE title with his win at the Royal Rumble, there was doubt that he would challenge Reigns as it seemed The Rock was going to go up against him in the main event. That storyline was put on hold as The Rock did main event Night 1 of WrestleMania, but in a tag-team match with Reigns against Rhodes and Seth Rollins.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nRhodes went on to win the WWE Undisputed Championship over Reigns on Night 2 of WrestleMania, but the reason behind the decision to catapult him into the main event is still a mystery to most fans. The story is set to be told in WWE's documentary on Wednesday night, \"WrestleMania XL: Behind the Curtains.\"\n\n\"The American Nightmare\" touched on how he felt about the ordeal in an interview on \"The Pivot.\" He said he had the utmost respect for The Rock and knew he was, in his soul, a pro wrestler when he got to know him. However, he was not just going to step aside for him.\n\n\"Where we could butt heads is in the idea that you could just come back in the midst of a story that was taking place and, just because you're The Rock, you can step into the starting lineup and take WrestleMania for yourself,\" Rhodes explained. \"A lot of people will say, 'He's The Rock, he can do whatever he wants.' I even saw this really fun podcast with two wrestling heads talking back and forth, and they said, 'I'm sure Cody's fine stepping aside for WrestleMania and then doing it later in the year.' In my mind, I'm thinking, that's insane. That's the Super Bowl for what we do.\n\nWWE SETTING RECORDS AT ARENAS AND STADIUMS AS POPULARITY SOARS IN 2024\n\n\"To get to the Sunday, the last day of WrestleMania, the last match, is our Super Bowl. And it used to be, financially, to get to that match was the big money match, when the pay was all different. The idea that somebody thought I would just be cool with it, they don't know me. That's nonsense. I've worked my whole life for this.\n\n\"Rock should know I wouldn't be cool with it. I think maybe that's an understanding that him and I had. He found out I'm not cool with it. That's a good thing. Because you know who wasn't cool with The Rock was Steve Austin, and they made magic together. They rubbed together so much, they created diamonds, they made magic together. So I do have a lot of respect for him.\"\n\nThe Rock told Rhodes at the \"Monday Night Raw\" after WrestleMania that he would see him when he returned. Rhodes said his head has been on a swivel ever since.\n\nRhodes is still the champion and has had multiple title defenses since defeating Reigns.

However, an opportunity for another main event emerged when The Rock became available to face Reigns. Rock said he and Nick Khan first started to talk about the match back in December of 2021.\n\n\"The deal wasn't quite there,\" he said. \"So we decided to shoot for WrestleMania the following year, which of course was WrestleMania 40.\"\n\nRock said the pieces started to come together once the TKO merger finalized. Triple H said he told Rhodes it wasn't likely he'd headline WrestleMania the afternoon of the Royal Rumble, only a few days after it was announced that Rock would be joining TKO's board of directors.\n\n\"I sat with Cody at the Royal Rumble in the afternoon and told him it was becoming more of a reality that the match with Roman and The Rock could take place at WrestleMania. I don't think anybody knew a thing outside of Cody. And I'm sure that was a brutal day,\" he said.\n\nLater, it was revealed that no plans were made for Rhodes after the angle took place where he allowed The Rock to step into his place at WrestleMania on the February 2 edition of SmackDown. Cameras captured Rhodes that day in a somber mood.\n\n\"Obviously his next question is where does that leave me. I'm like, not sure yet. So that's on me to figure out because this is all happening in real time...we're going to see what the reaction is,\" Triple H said.\n\nThe reaction to the SmackDown angle online and crowd reactions on the following episode of Raw eventually caused everyone to pivot. The Rock revealed that he was the one who pitched the idea of Roman vs. Cody, with himself going heel.\n\n\"I called Nick [Khan] and Triple H and I called Ari [Emanuel]. I said, here's how I'm feeling. We can truck through this and we can put on this main event. And the majority of the world, many of which who don't watch WWE who we do plan on pulling in...they're going to love this idea of Rock and Roman and we're going to tell this amazing story. Hopefully this will be the first chapter of a few. We could do that. However, my gut says Ari, Nick, Triple H, my gut says I don't like, even if its like a segment of fans, I don't like that they're upset. And that really bugged the s*** out of me. And it's not how I've operated my entire career. I don't like it. And I knew, essentially, the choice was mine.\"\n\nEventually, the story turned into Rhodes & Seth Rollins teaming together to take on Reigns & The Rock on night one, with the stipulation being if Rock & Reigns won, Bloodline rules would take place the following night when Rhodes challenged Reigns for the WWE title. Reigns & The Rock ended up winning night one, but Rhodes won the following night regardless of the stipulation to finish his story and become WWE Champion for the first time.\n\nSource", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_rose@postandcourier.com", "name": "Bryan Rose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Rhodes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cody Rhodes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_H", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple H"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_39", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania 39"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Rumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_SmackDown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WWE SmackDown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Rollins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seth Rollins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Raw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Raw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Rock, Paper, Scissors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Resolers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Resolers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/0d/90d952fb-1dd9-57a6-aa5e-deb0b86d890a/668632121c9c0.image.jpg?crop=1024%2C538%2C0%2C19&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701345", "eventUri": "eng-9701345", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-02", "textStart": 1527, "textEnd": 1537}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

He ended up being the star of that April weekend in Philadelphia, finishing his story on night two by ending Roman Reigns' historic WWE title run and capturing the belt that eluded his Hall of Fame father throughout his career.\n\nHe's dropped some tidbits in the past about how he went from winning the Royal Rumble to momentarily stepping aside for Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson to that moment. And we heard from Johnson's creative partner Brian Gewirtz that Rhodes was supposed to be more enthusiastic about giving up his second straight 'Mania main event so The Rock could have his dream match against Reigns.\n\nNow, ahead of the WWE doc's release, Rhodes shared another advance peak behind the curtain with Super Bowl champ-turned-sports talk star Ryan Clark and the rest of The Pivot podcast crew.\n\nIt comes when the former Pittsburgh Steelers Pro Bowl safety asked Cody why he said he's not a fan of The Rock.\n\n\"I grew up a huge fan. I have a lot of respect for The Rock -- maybe more than anybody in any locker room, because when I made eye contact with The Rock for the very first piece of business we ever did, I got an instant understanding of who he is.

He's not a businessman with all these partnerships.\n\n\"When I looked at him in the eyes, I saw exactly what he is: He's a pro wrestler. He's a pro wrestler who understands the nature of, 'I'd like this crowd to be really excited, then I'm gonna get them really upset, then I'm gonna get them as excited as they've ever been, then I'm gonna get them telling their friends to come back.' So in that moment, I had the utmost respect for him, because in my heart, that's how I feel. I could do a bazillion other things, but I'm a wrestler. That's what I am, and to see that from the biggest movie star on the planet -- so a lot of respect.\n\n\"Where we would butt heads is in the idea that you could just come back in the midst of a story that was taking place, and just because you're The Rock, you can step into the starting lineup and take WrestleMania for yourself. And a lot of people will say, 'He's The Rock, he can do whatever he wants.' I even saw this fun podcast with two wrestling heads just talking back and forth, and they had said, 'I'm sure Cody's fine stepping aside for WrestleMania and then doing it later in the year.'\n\n\"And in my mind I'm thinking, 'That's insane.' That's the Super Bowl for what we do. To get to the Sunday, the last day of WrestleMania, the last match, is our literal Super Bowl... The idea that somebody thought I would just be cool with it is -- They don't know me. That's nonsense. I worked my whole life for this.\n\n\"Rock should know I wouldn't be cool with it. Maybe that's an understanding that him and I have, is he found out, hey, I'm not cool with it. That's a good thing. Cause you know who wasn't cool with The Rock was Steve Austin. And they made magic together. They rubbed together so much it created diamonds, they made magic together. So, I do have a lot of respect for him.\"\n\nThe angle Triple H & WWE's creative team came up with (along with the players and their people) involves a lot of real world elements like Johnson's seat on the Board of WWE's parent company TKO, so it's impossible to rule out how their presentation of the \"real\" story will be enhanced, manipulated, or even made up to fuel future business they want to do. And a Rock/Rhodes singles match is absolutely one piece of business all involved want to do.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, I'm not buying this -- or whatever we get in the documentary -- whole cloth. But Cody's doing his job well here, because the story he's offering has me more excited for the WrestleMania XL: Behind The Curtain documentary. And the doc should in turn get me more excited for those future pieces of business.", "source": {"uri": "cagesideseats.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cageside Seats"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_rueter@cagesideseats.com", "name": "Sean Rueter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Rhodes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cody Rhodes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Clark_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Clark (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Rumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amateur wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_XL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania XL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stone Cold Steve Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_H", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple H"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BygsuOaS-oVhcac8RzMVAU0JslU=/0x38:1200x638/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25274161/080_SD_02022024_CN_33608__afc9895a1dc9a4b79c4d02de56808711.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701345", "eventUri": "eng-9701345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

I don't like it. I knew that the choice essentially was mine. I believe we should go Roman/Cody, will Cody finish his story,\" he added.\n\nMonths ahead of WrestleMania 40, it was speculated that The Rock would return to WWE to take on Roman Reigns for the Undisputed Universal Championship. Speaking further in the documentary, The Rock revealed what he had pitched to the company officials previously.\n\n\"I said 'here's how I'm feeling - We can truck through this and we can put on this main event. The majority of the world, many of which who don't watch WWE - who we do plan on pulling in in the execution of our marketing plan etc, they are gonna love this idea of Rock and Roman and we're gonna tell an amazing story. We could do that,\" The Rock said.\n\nThe Rock versus Reigns match was soon waved off. Fans also wanted to see Rhodes complete his story after losing WrestleMania 39's main event against the Tribal Chief. After missing out on the main event at the Show of Shows, The Rock turned his eyes to a tag-team fixture. He teamed up with Reigns to take on Rhodes and Seth Rollins on Night 1 of WrestleMania 40. In that match, The Rock pinned the American Nightmare to seal a victory.\n\nA defeat on the first day of WrestleMania 40 led to several doubts about whether Rhodes would beat Reigns for the Universal Championship. To the fans' liking, Rhodes was able to complete his story by pinning Reigns on the final night of the Show of Shows.

Rhodes captured the Undisputed WWE Universal Title from Roman Reigns, with The Rock and others involved. Rhodes expressed his disagreement with the decision, emphasizing the importance of his own journey and the potential for friction to be good for business.\n\nJust hours before the behind-the-scenes WrestleMania 40 documentary is released by WWE on YouTube, Cody Rhodes addressed the recent rumors about his involvement in the main event. Specifically, his willingness to let The Rock take his main event spot at WWE WrestleMania 40. The speculation suggested that Rhodes was open to stepping aside for The Rock, who was initially pushing for a singles match against Roman Reigns. However, Rhodes has firmly denied these claims, adding another layer to the story behind the scenes.\n\nFans Wondered Why Cody Was Cool With The Rock Taking His Spot\n\nThe main event of night one at WrestleMania 40 saw The Rock team with Roman Reigns against Rhodes and Seth Rollins, with the heels emerging victorious. But, that wasn't the original plan for the show. The following night, Rhodes captured the Undisputed WWE Universal Title from Reigns, with The Rock and others getting involved. Originally, this was always going to be the main event, even though the booking might have been slightly different.\n\nSomewhere on the road to WrestleMania, things got messy.\n\nInitially, Rhodes was slated to face Reigns for the title in a straightforward singles match. However, The Rock's return in January altered these plans. The Rock campaigned for a high-profile singles match with Reigns, which The Rock called the biggest main event in WWE and WrestleMania history. On an episode of SmackDown, Rhodes seemed to willingly walk away from the main event match he'd spent two years working toward. The WWE Universe was confused with why WWE would try to sell that angle and why Rhodes would agree to it.\n\nRhodes Wasn't On Board With the Decision\n\nIn a recent interview on The Pivot Podcast, Rhodes confirmed he wasn't at all happy with the decision. He explained:\n\n\"Where we would butt heads is in the idea that you could just come back in the midst of a story that was taking place, and just because you're The Rock, you can step into the starting lineup and take WrestleMania for yourself. A lot of people said, 'He's The Rock. He can do whatever he wants.' I even saw a podcast with two wrestling heads talking, and they said, 'I'm sure Cody is fine stepping aside for WrestleMania and doing it later in the year.' In my mind, I'm thinking, 'That's insane.' That's the Super Bowl of what we do. To get to Sunday, the last day of WrestleMania, the last match, it's our literal Super Bowl. The idea that somebody thought I would be cool with it. They don't know me. That's nonsense. I worked my whole life for this.\"\n\nRhodes then said The Rock had to know he wasn't going to be cool with it. Even if he didn't know on his own, Rhodes suggested The Rock found out, and noted, \"That's a good thing.\" Not only because it let The Rock know where Cody stood, but because that kind of friction can actually be good for business. He used The Rock and Steve Austin as a perfect example. They butted heads a lot but always made magic.\n\nRhodes acknowledged that while he respects The Rock, he wants to ensure that his own journey is not overshadowed. It all worked out and now, The American Nightmare and The Final Boss are Rhodes potentially set to lock up in the future.", "source": {"uri": "thesportster.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Probably why Rhodes stole his entire gimmick, or at least why he won't turn to the dark side to follow in his footsteps.\n\nWhy did WWE agree to this collaboration deal - besides the money, of course? Was it to get attention for the promotion ahead of Money in the Bank? Or maybe as a tongue-in-cheek way of tipping the hat to Rhodes heel truthers even if they aren't willing to pull the trigger on the deal right now, a sort of John Cena joins the nWo during the Firefly Funhouse match at WrestleMania 36? Either way, if Rhodes wants to remain on top as a babyface, this probably isn't the way to get it done.\n\nWhile it's unclear how Rhodes feels about The Rock personally at the moment, at the time he was excited to see him return, as he had nothing but respect for one of the greatest professionals to ever lace up a pair of boots.\n\n\"I grew up a huge fan of The Rock. I have a lot of respect for The Rock. Maybe more than anybody in any locker room. When I made eye contact with The Rock for the very first piece of business we ever did, I got an instant understanding of who he is,\" Cody Rhodes told The Pivot via Fightful.\n\n\"He's not a movie star. He's not a potential Presidential nominee, which would be great at this point. He's not a businessman with all these partnerships. When I looked at him in the eyes, I saw exactly what he is. He's a pro wrestler. He's a pro wrestler who understands the nature, 'I like this crowd. I'm going to get them really excited. Then really upset. Then as excited as they've ever been. Then I'm going to get them to tell their friends to come back.' At that moment, I had the utmost respect for him because in my heart, that's how I feel. I could do a bazillion other things, but I'm a wrestler. To see that from the biggest movie star on the planet, it's a lot of respect.\"\n\nRhodes then went on to discuss the decision to push The Rock for a main event spot at WrestleMania 40, seemingly putting his \"Story\" on ice in favor of another tail. While Rhodes did go along with it and fans ultimately saw how things shook out in the end, he wasn't exactly stoked on WWE's initial decision, as he didn't want to lose what he'd worked so hard to obtain.\n\n\"Where we would butt heads is in the idea that you could just come back in the midst of a story that was taking place and just because you're The Rock, you can step into the starting lineup and take WrestleMania for yourself,\" Rhodes noted.\"A lot of people said, 'He's The Rock. He can do whatever he wants.' I saw a podcast with two wrestling heads talking and they said, 'I'm sure Cody is fine stepping aside for WrestleMania and doing it later in the year.' In my mind, I'm thinking, 'That's insane.' That's the Super Bowl of what we do. The last day of WrestleMania, the last match, it's our literal Super Bowl. The idea that somebody thought I would be cool with it. They don't know me. That's nonsense. I worked my whole life for this. Rock should know I wouldn't be cool with it. Maybe that's an understanding him and I have. He found out, I'm not cool with it. That's a good thing. You know who wasn't cool with The Rock? Steve Austin. They made magic together. They rubbed together so much it created diamonds. I do have a lot of respect for him.\"\n\nDid WWE do Rhodes wrong with their initial handling of The Rock's return? Yes, while fans now appreciate how it all came together, it's safe to say Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque and company were flying by the seat of their pants at the time and did genuinely hope to have The Rock headline Night 2 against Roman Reigns when they booked the duo's shared segment. When The Rock's long-awaited documentary on the subject ultimately comes out, hopefully this dynamic will be more fleshed out for curious fans to sink their teeth into.", "source": {"uri":

Fans have anxiously awaited this behind-the-scenes look at the most successful WrestleMania in the company's storied history.\n\nThe \"Showcase of the Immortals,\" as it has come to be known, is the biggest event in professional wrestling. Months of storytelling culminate in a Super Bowl-esque extravaganza for hundreds of thousands of fans who pack out the largest football stadiums, two nights in a row. the documentary chronicles every moment leading up to the main event in Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field, following Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns, Seth \"Freakin'\" Rollins, movie megastar/wrestling legend Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, and WWE creative head Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque as they intricately weave their way through the chaos of building one of professional wrestling's greatest storylines of all time.\n\nIn April 2023, one year before WrestleMania XL, the WWE merged with Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) to form TKO Group Holdings. During this, Triple H was spearheading WWE's creative direction to the adoration of wrestling diehards. Not a single beat was skipped creatively.\n\nBy January 2024, Johnson would be appointed to TKO's board of directors along with being the new holder for the trademark rights of his in-ring character, \"The Rock.\"\n\nAfter a failed attempt to secure a main event in 2023's WrestleMania with Roman Reigns, Johnson's real-life cousin, the stage was set for Rock to return to the ring to face Reigns in Philly.\n\nThere was just one problem... a nightmare, if you will: Cody Rhodes.\n\nRhodes was on the verge of finishing a story decades in the making. His father, wrestling legend Dusty Rhodes, had never once held a world title with the organization despite being a prominent name in the business. Cody had promised his father that he would one day hold that very title.\n\nWhile the story is simple, Rhodes' journey was anything but.\n\nCody struggled to get over with WWE audiences and the creative team, leading to numerous character changes during his initial tenure with the company.\n\nAfter leaving in 2016, Rhodes wrestled in independent circuits worldwide, helping to start rival wrestling promotion All-Elite Wrestling.\n\nWhen Rhodes returned to the WWE in 2022, he was the \"American Nightmare,\" a slick play on his father's persona, \"The American Dream.\"\n\nBut as has been seen with many big-fish independent wrestlers jumping into the ocean that is World Wrestling Entertainment, Rhodes had to get over in a big way if he wanted the richest prize in the game, the WWE Undisputed Championship held by Roman Reigns.\n\nAnd get over, he did.\n\nRhodes successfully earned a title shot at WrestleMania 39 in Inglewood, CA, against Reigns but ultimately lost, becoming another notch in the bedpost tracking Reigns' unprecedented 1,316-day run as WWE Undisputed Champion.\n\nNothing about Reigns should be taken for granted here. Holding the title for over three and a half years is a feat that hasn't been touched since the 80s in the WWE. He also happens to be part of one of wrestling's royal families, aka The Bloodline, which also includes The Rock.\n\nThe writing was on the wall for Reigns and Rock to eventually square off and provide the biggest main event in sports entertainment history, and the time was WrestleMania XL.\n\nRhodes, meanwhile, would secure a world title shot of his choosing after winning his second Royal Rumble match in a row.\n\nThis was quite the predicament for Triple H and the WWE creative team. To go with the clear blockbuster matchup of Rock vs Reigns or appease the diehard fans ready to finally see Rhodes live his and his father's dream.\n\nIf there's anything that's been learned about the game... it's how one plays it.\n\nViewers come into any WWE-produced documentary understanding there will be a layer of protection for all parties involved. Add in that The Rock is a gigantic public figure, and an actual board member of the company who possibly holds political aspirations, he simply can't be made out to be a control freak who doesn't care about some jabroni's title shot.\n\nThat said, I frankly didn't care about Cody's title shot at the time, personally.\n\n\"The Great One has returned! Move aside you Homelander-cosplaying daddy's boy,\" I thought at the time. I even hoped Rock would return at the Royal Rumble and then challenge Reigns for the belt at 'Mania.\n\nBut if Blue-tista taught us anything, it is that no matter how beloved a personality is, wrestling fans will make their presence felt, for better or worse.\n\nHere is where The Rock, Seven Bucks Productions' Brian Gerwirtz, Levesque, and the WWE writing staff deserve extreme due credit. They chose to listen to the fans and fly by the seat of their pants to deliver a storyline unlike any ever seen before. If that doesn't warrant the official title of \"People's Champion,\" then why even create an entire belt specifically for it?\n\nIt's symbolic of seeing the bigger picture and being able to deliver what the people wanted; Cody Rhodes. And by the end of it, even disapprovers like this author wanted it, too.\n\nI enjoyed the honest commentary from all the major players here. Even if it kills kayfabe, the documentary feels like it will live on for generations to come. The storyline became an instant classic and was genuinely loved by both the \"marks\" and \"smarks\" of the world.\n\nA beautifully edited montage of the Rhodes-vs-Reigns main event on Night 2 skillfully puts the viewer right back into reliving moment after glorious moment before faith in the promotion is rewarded. Rhodes finishes his story and kisses the center of the ring.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The landscape he may find when he returns is nothing like what he left: The Bloodline is completely diverse.\n\nRoman Reigns shows no signs of life, Jimmy is no longer around and everything that made his short stay a small paradise has vanished in the cool summer breeze.\n\nOn second thought, though, there's probably one thing that will remain the same, and that's the fact that Cody Rhodes will likely still be champion. The Atlanta native has been unrivaled since winning the championship in April and has already defeated AJ Styles and Logan Paul in high-profile bouts, proving that he's at the top of the roster.\n\nRhodes spoke about The Rock's potential comeback on \"The Pivot podcast\": \"I wouldn't want him to come back the same way he did for WrestleMania. It's not enough to train for two or three months, say he's really sorry that he's got a lot of work in Hollywood and go back out.\n\n\"I hope he comes back and I hope he comes back fully psyched so we can continue our rivalry. If I could give you a date, I would say it will be next year already; I think 2025.\"\n\nAll signs suggest 2025 as the most appropriate date for that to happen. The place for that big match would be WrestleMania 41, but we wouldn't have to wait until April, as The Rock could return at the Royal Rumble (at the end of January) to restart the rivalry in the lead up to the big show.\n\nRhodes doesn't forget that The Rock is to blame for nearly missing out on the WrestleMania main event, and that, if it weren't for the fans, the current situation could be quite diverse.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who think he's The Rock and he can do whatever he wants. I've come to hear that and it sounds crazy to me,\" said Rhodes.\n\n\"To make it to the main event on the second night of WrestleMania, which needless to say is our Super Bowl, you have to be here and have proven things all year long. Rock should know that I'm not one of those guys and it didn't feel right to me; I wasn't going to walk away.\"\n\nWith all this brewing behind the scenes, Cody has to have an opponent to match him until the time comes, and everything seems to indicate that it will be Randy Orton who will test him.\n\nThey have a history, a past and a present, now that both have joined forces against Sikoa and his henchmen.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Rhodes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cody Rhodes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_XL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania XL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloodline_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bloodline (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ_Styles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AJ Styles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Rumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Orton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randy Orton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/37e1496283800bcdd546f55a71c0d649/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/07/03/17200243990893.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701345", "eventUri": "eng-9701345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

This was documented by many cameras throughout the whole experience, and fans got to finally see the documentary on YouTube today after months of edits.\n\nIn the WrestleMania XL: Behind The Curtain documentary, The Rock addressed the decision to switch from a match between him and Reigns to one between Cody and Reigns. He explained a meeting he had with WWE officials where he shared his thoughts on the matter.\n\nThe Rock expressed that while they could go ahead with the main event featuring him and Roman Reigns, which would attract a broad audience, including many who don't typically watch WWE, he felt uneasy about a segment of fans being upset. This discomfort went against how he had operated throughout his career.\n\n\"I said 'here's how I'm feeling.' We can truck through this and we can put on this main event. The majority of the world, many of which who don't watch WWE - who we do plan on pulling in in the execution of our marketing plan etc, they're gonna love this idea of Rock and Roman and we're gonna tell an amazing story. We could do that.\"\n\n\"My gut says that I don't like, even if it's a segment of fans, I don't like that they're upset and it really bugged the shit out of me. It's not how I've operated my entire career. I don't like it. I knew that the choice essentially was mine. I believe we should go Roman/Cody, will Cody finish his story? Take care of those fans because it's critical and important.\"\n\nDuring the February 2nd, 2024 edition of WWE Smackdown, Cody Rhodes appeared to step aside to allow Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson to face Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 40. However, at the Kickoff event, Cody ultimately chose Reigns as his opponent for WrestleMania.\n\nCody Rhodes said that The Rock should have known that he wouldn't be okay with losing the WrestleMania 40 main event match spot to The Rock. In the end, they went the direction they did and the Final Boss ended up in a tag team match on night one instead. Only time will tell how things pan out for WrestleMania 41, because The Rock has promised his return.\n\nWhat's your take on The Rock doing his thing at WrestleMania 40?

However, Rhodes surprised many by confronting the leader of The Bloodline and informing him that he would not be his opponent at this year's Show of Shows and instead gave up his spot to The Rock initially.\n\nThe WrestleMania XL: Behind The Curtain documentary revealed Cody Rhodes' immediate reaction following the shocking decision, as he was clearly dejected and noted that he had to believe he wouldn't lose the faith fans had in him.\n\n\"I have to believe, right, one thing, you can lose the faith of the fans. We've seen it tons of times. I have to believe that I won't lose their faith. And there might be fans who are upset that I've been talking about this title for two years and haven't decided to wrestle Roman Reigns at WrestleMania.\"\n\nWWE CCO Triple H revealed that Cody asked him about his future plans for The Showcase of the Immortals following a significant change. The Game admitted he originally had no idea what he had planned for Rhodes.\n\n\"Obviously, his next question is, where does that leave me? I'm, like, not sure yet. So that's on me to figure out cuz this is all happening in real time.\n\nWe're gonna see, at least that's how I saw it is, we're going to see what the reaction is.\"\n\nThankfully, the die-hard wrestling fanbase rallied behind Cody Rhodes, sparking a massive backlash.

Rhodes was recently a guest on the Pivot Podcast where he was asked about being willing to step aside for the Rock to challenge Roman Reigns instead.\n\nRhodes said that the issue was anyone believing that he would be ok with just letting the Rock come in and take the spot. He went on to say that anyone who believed he would be ok with the change did not know him, citing the main event of WrestleMania as the \"Super Bowl of what we do.\" Rock vs. Rhodes has been rumored for WrestleMania 41 but not yet confirmed.\n\nThey had a history. Check out Rock and Rhodes' history:\n\nOpinion: It makes sense that Rhodes would not be happy with the change and thankfully WWE made a big adjustment after going with a story that did not seem to be the most popular. What matters is getting the biggest and most interesting feud possible for WrestleMania's main event and that is what they did, with Rhodes being the centerpiece that a lot of people were wanting to see.\n\nYou can find more from Thomas Hall at kbwrestlingreviews.com, or check out his- Amazon author page with 30 wrestling books.", "source": {"uri": "wrestlingrumors.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "WrestlingRumors.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_hall@wrestlingrumors.net", "name": "Thomas Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rhodes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rhodes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Rhodes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cody Rhodes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Elite_Wrestling", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All Elite Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Rumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Rumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Main_Event", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WWE Main Event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://media.wrestlingrumors.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/13031011/The-Rock-Cody-Rhodes.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701345", "eventUri": "eng-9701345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

That means Rhodes knew that when he found Reigns in the crowd and pointed at him, issuing a challenge as soon as he won the Rumble. That wasn't enough to stop the Reigns vs. Rock match from happening, but fan backlash to the change forced WWE to make the right decision.\n\nWrestleMania XL: Behind The Curtain, a documentary that was supposed to air directly after WrestleMania 40, has finally been released. The doc tracks the build to this year's blockbuster WrestleMania with a heavy focus on the rollercoaster ride that was the build to its night one and night two main events. The biggest question hanging over that build is how close were we to really not getting Cody Rhodes vs. Roman Reigns 2? Turns out we were pretty darn close.\n\nThe Royal Rumble Point\n\nTriple H confirmed during the doc that he sat down with Rhodes on the afternoon of the Royal Rumble, so hours before The American Nightmare went out there and booked his spot in the WrestleMania main event, to tell him Reigns vs. The Rock on The Grandest Stage Of Them All was becoming a reality (H/T to WrestleTalk for the transcription).\n\nI sat with Cody at the Royal Rumble that afternoon and told him it was more becoming more of a reality that the match between Roman and Rock could take place at WrestleMania, and I don't think anybody knew a thing outside of Cody, and I'm sure that was a brutal day.\n\nTo describe the day on which Rhodes would be winning the men's Royal Rumble for the second year in a row brutal just goes to show how hard it likely hit Rhodes that after all that work, he wouldn't be getting the chance to finish his story. Triple H revealing that conversation happened when it did also confirms that when Rhodes stood on the turnbuckle and pointed to Reigns watching from a skybox, he was going into business for himself.\n\nPlans Really Do Change\n\nAt that moment, the plan was for Reigns vs. Rock to be the main event at WrestleMania 40. Days later, Rhodes would officially sacrifice his shot to The Great One. The documentary followed Rhodes back to his bus after that happened, a clearly deflated grandson of a plumber admitting he'd need to rely on fan reactions from here on in, a bottle of vodka in front of him. A low point and one where he likely assumed the stunt he pulled by gesturing to Reigns after the Rumble wasn't going to be enough.\n\nRock was also featured in the documentary and admitted he was the one who made the call to switch the match back and give Rhodes the chance to finish his story. A wise decision, eventually, and one that led to one of the greatest main events in WrestleMania history, not to mention a fantastic build. If you didn't already need reminding, know now more than ever with Triple H and The Rock calling the shots, if fan reactions are passionate and loud enough, bad decisions can and will be reversed.",

A lot of people said, 'He's The Rock. He can do whatever he wants.' I even saw a podcast with two wrestling heads talking, and they said, 'I'm sure Cody is fine stepping aside for WrestleMania and doing it later in the year.' In my mind, I'm thinking, 'That's insane.'\n\n\"That's the Super Bowl of what we do. To get to Sunday, the last day of WrestleMania, the last match, it's our literal Super Bowl. The idea that somebody thought I would be cool with it. They don't know me. That's nonsense. I worked my whole life for this. Rock should know I wouldn't be cool with it. Maybe that's an understanding that him and I have. He found out, I'm not cool with it. That's a good thing. You know who wasn't cool with The Rock? Steve Austin. They made magic together. They rubbed together so much it created diamonds. I do have a lot of respect for him.\"\n\nIt was obvious early on that the objective of The Rock returning to WWE in January was to set up a match with Reigns for WrestleMania.\n\nAfter Rhodes won the Royal Rumble and fans started turning on the idea of Rock taking his spot, especially since WWE had been building the story of the American Nightmare finishing the story for the past year, something had to change.\n\nIt's to the credit of everyone involved that WWE did pivot by aligning Rock with Reigns and the Bloodline, giving Rhodes the moment he earned. It also worked out great in the long-term because instead of potentially just one match for the Brahma Bull, WWE could a total of three WrestleMania matches from him.\n\nRhodes and Rock have already teased doing a singles bout after the Final Boss pinned the undisputed WWE champion in the main event of WrestleMania night one. The match between Rock and Reigns is also still floating out there.\n\nRhodes Addresses Potential Heel Turn\n\nIn the same interview on The Pivot Podcast, Rhodes also talked about the possibility of eventually turning heel and what that might mean.\n\nThere does come a point when the top babyface runs the risk of alienating at least some portion of the audience, for whatever reason. John Cena spent years being booed by a vocal group of WWE fans, but he and the promotion resisted the urge to turn him heel.\n\nCena recently admitted in an interview on Insight with Chris Van Vliet (h/t Nick Miller of Wrestling Inc.) there was a plan for him to turn heel in 2011 when he was feuding with The Rock:\n\n\"I got word that they were gonna do it. I went out and recorded a new song. I went out and got all new gear. ... I was ready to go and already thinking about what I can do with the story. What is a heel? A heel is not just new gear. ... The message behind the singlet and the boxing robes and the boots is it's the exact opposite of what you saw with the street gear.\"\n\nThe plan was aborted, according to Cena, because the company was concerned about what it would mean financially since heels don't sell as much merchandise as babyfaces.\n\nThere is no reason to think about turning Rhodes at this point. He's the biggest star in WWE right now, and he moves merchandise like few other people in the industry can.\n\nIt wouldn't be a surprise if there comes a point when Rhodes turns heel, but fans shouldn't expect it to happen for a long time.\n\nRumors on WWE Trademark Filing, MVP's Contract Status\n\nWWE has taken advantage of some iconic WCW events, including WarGames, Great American Bash and Halloween Havoc.\n\nThe company could add another former WCW pay-per-view to that list.\n\nPer Subhojeet Mukherjee of Ringside News, WWE filed to trademark SuperBrawl for broadcast media.\n\nThis would seem to indicate WWE plans to use the name for an upcoming event. It wouldn't be a surprise if SuperBrawl gets used for an NXT special event, since the developmental brand has been using Great American Bash and Halloween Havoc since 2020.\n\nSuperBrawl was one of WCW's signature events from 1991 to 2001. The 2001 show was the penultimate pay-per-view in WCW history before the company was sold to WWE.\n\nAnother rumor from WWE involves MVP's status. The former manager of the Hurt Business is still under contract to the company, per Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful Select (h/t Jenkins).\n\nSince MVP is currently managing Omos, whose only television matches this year were the Royal Rumble and Andre The Giant Memorial Battle Royal on the April 5 episode of SmackDown, there hasn't been an opportunity to get the former United States champ on TV.\n\nMVP's in-ring career might be over at this point. His last match was nearly two years ago to the date in a tag bout with Omos against Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford on Raw on July 18, 2022.\n\nGiven how deep WWE's roster is at this point and how packed both Raw and SmackDown are each week, it's going to be hard to find time to get all of the people under contract time on television.\n\nIf there is a good creative idea for MVP and/or Omos, he will likely be back on the red brand when that happens.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_wells@bleacherreport.com",

match", "body": "Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes is still expecting a huge showdown with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson - and knows exactly how long he might have to wait.\n\nRhodes is the reigning Undisputed champ in WWE thanks to his epic WrestleMania win over Roman Reigns back in April.\n\nA sizable byproduct of the build to that main event match was the rivalry that developed between Rhodes and The Rock.\n\nAs well as leaving him bloodied and battered in a beatdown that left fans in tears, Rock got over on The American Nightmare by pinning him in the tag team bout that came the night prior to Rhodes' major success.\n\nAs such, there's plenty of mileage left in the feud between the two, with a future showdown almost inevitable after The People's Champ vowed post-WrestleMania that he'd be heading back to WWE specifically to pick up where he'd left of.\n\nIn reality, Johnson stepped back away from wrestling commitments to film The Smashing Machine, but it hasn't dampened speculation as to when he'll tune back into WWE duties.\n\nRhodes is ready, however, telling The Pivot podcast that he's prepared for the titanic tussle - once Johnson can spare the time.\n\n\"The Rock told me he'd see me when he comes back,\" he explained.\n\n\"My head has been on a swivel every day since the day after WrestleMania, for when the Final Boss, as the Rock goes by now, for when his music hits.\n\n\"I'll be 100% in the same spot I was, and I'll be ready for him.\n\n\"If he comes in any bit like he did for WrestleMania, he'll be doing the whole 'oh I finally got off, I've been so busy' - the dude was on like a three-month training camp, he was dialled in, so I will certainly be dialled in myself.\n\n\"If I could give you a guess, I feel like, I hope it happens in the next year.\"\n\nWWE have made no secret of the fact that a match between Rock and Reigns had been the original plan for WrestleMania, only for a strong fan backlash to force a frantic change of plans that saw Rhodes put back into pole position in the storyline, with The Undertaker and John Cena playing a part in a memorable Mania moment.\n\nWhile Rhodes spoke mainly in character about the movie megastar, he did hint that the pair may have legitimately 'butted heads' on the issue of Rock being inserted into the title picture, effectively ahead of him, saying: \"He found out I wasn't cool with it.\"\n\nRhodes later dodged the more direct question when asked whether it had resulted in real beef between the two, instead discussing his differences with fellow star Seth Rollins.\n\nRhodes will wrestle in a marquee match at WWE's Money in the Bank Premium Live Event on Saturday, having successfully defended his title against the likes of Logan Paul and AJ Styles in recent months.\n\nHe teams with Kevin Owens and Randy Orton in a six-man tag team encounter with The Bloodline, in what promises to be a hard-hitting contest.\n\nAs well as the men and women's ladder matches that give the event its name, Saturday's show also features Sami Zayn defending his Intercontinental title against Bron Breakker, while Seth Rollins challenges Damian Priest for the World Heavyweight Championship.",

In the WrestleMania XL: Behind The Curtain documentary, WWE CCO Triple H revealed that considering the year-long buildup for Rhodes, not having him win the Royal Rumble would have derailed his momentum and credibility as the top star.\n\nMoreover, still a bit sceptical about the main event at that point, The Game wanted to see the audience's reaction to Cody Rhodes's victory and then make a decision, despite himself informing Cody of the heartbreaking news regarding WrestleMania earlier in the day.\n\n\"My gut was that if Cody fails, that damages him. We gotta have him win the Rumble and see what the reaction is, and then go from there.\"\n\nHowever, as it turned out, the fans rejected The Rock and sided with Cody Rhodes. This led to The Final Boss using his influence to change the main event at WrestleMania 40 and give the fans what they desired to see with Cody Rhodes emerging on top at The Showcase of the Immortals.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Triple H's decision to book Cody Rhodes to win the 2024 Royal Rumble match?

It showed the excitement surrounding his return, the heartbreak some - read: Cody Rhodes - felt along the way, and ultimately how Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque and company landed on their eventual main event, the \"American Nightmare\" and Seth Rollins versus Roman Reigns and the \"Final Boss.\"\n\nNow, for fans who genuinely didn't follow along with the backstage drama going on behind the scenes from January through the first full weekend of April, let alone those who didn't religiously watch the promotion's television product through the first third of the year, there is probably plenty of entertaining tidbits sprinkled throughout the show, like when Rhodes learned about Rock-Roman, or the backstage meetings that ultimately led to the main events that took place.\n\nBut for fans in the know? Fans who followed along every step of the way? This documentary felt like low-key propaganda if not outright revisionist history.\n\nTake, for example, the news that Rhodes was told the day of the Rumble that Rock-Roman was potentially on the table. If that was the case, why did Rhodes, a true company man, point at Reigns and declare he wanted him, with cameras following him along and Michael Cole hyping up the call? Wouldn't Cole have been instructed to play up the ambiguity, let alone Rhodes told not to make the point?\n\nGranted, the promotion did try to spin this, showing how The Rock is talking to the writers and media about a way to make things right for everyone, but doesn't this feel more like a revisionist spin, as opposed to the in-the-moment reactions, especially when the documentary literally lets it be known that Rhodes-Reigns was the initial plan, then Rock-Reigns, before finally settling on what fans got in the end?\n\nUltimately, this show was just that, a show that gave fans an insider's perspective on The Rock's return and showcased him as a galavanting hero who finally answered fans' pleas for another match in a massive way. Even if the chances of Rock-Reigns now feel incredibly unlikely, at least any time soon, fans now have a feud between the \"Final Boss\" and the WWE Champion to look forward to, and frankly, that's a solid payoff to what felt like a very contentious situation.\n\nThe Rock reveals how he allowed Cody Rhodes to finish his story\n\nSpeaking of The Rock's big return to WWE and how it impacted the WrestleMania 40 plans, the \"Final Boss\" delivered an absolute humdinger of a quote in a standout segment of the WrestleMania XL: Behind The Curtain documentary, where he handed over his main spot to the \"American Nightmare\" and his \"Cody Crybabies.\"\n\n\"I called Nick and Triple H, and I called Ari, and I said, 'Here's how I'm feeling. We can truck through this and put on this main event, and the majority of the world who don't watch WWE, they're gonna love this idea of Rock and Roman, and we're gonna tell an amazing story.\n\n\"We could do that, but my gut says, Ari, Nick, and Triple H, my guy says, I don't like, even if it's a segment of fans, I don't like that they're upset, and I knew that the choice was essentially mine. Either we truck through this and we make this main event, or we don't, and I went with the latter. I told those guys here's what I believe we should do. We should go Roman vs. Cody, let Cody finish his story, because it's critical and important to those fans, the 'Cody Crybabies' I called them.\"\n\nIs everything The Rock said in the segment correct? Yes, technically, it is; casual fans would have loved Rock-Reigns, and even if it came at the expense of Rhodes' match, even hardcore fans would have come around to it, too. And yet, it's the way he talks about it that simply rubs some fans the wrong way, as WWE played into the \"We Want Cody\" conversation on par with, if not more than, the natural upswell of fans support who organically chanted the phrase at shows and posted about it online. If The Rock wants to take that win, he can have it, even if it's not too hard to see that it isn't totally true.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matty_breisch@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Matty Breisch", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_XL", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania XL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Rhodes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cody Rhodes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Rollins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seth Rollins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_H", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple H"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cole_(wrestling)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cole (wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hardcore wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Rock, Paper, Scissors", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Resolers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Resolers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/What-does-The-Rock-WWE-really-gain-with-WrestleMania-XL-Behind-The-Curtain.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701345", "eventUri": "eng-9701345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The Rock pitches the idea to revert back to Roman vs. Cody, addressing fan sentiment. WWE pivots, and Cody becomes the champion, setting up a huge showdown at WrestleMania 41.\n\nWWE finally released the much anticipated \"WrestleMania XL:Behind the Curtain\" documentary about the lead-up to WrestleMania 40 on Wednesday. Fans were curious to see how the big pivot came about and who was responsible for all of the chaos. When it was announced The Rock would take on Roman Reigns, things went off the rails. But, it was also The Rock who seemingly got things back on the tracks.\n\nThe Rock Said He Didn't Like Upsetting Cody Fans\n\nDuring the documentary, The Rock expressed his regret over angering a portion of the fanbase by taking Cody's spot in the match against Roman Reigns. He and Triple H believed that delivering the Roman Reigns vs. The Rock match was what fans wanted and Reigns said it was good to finally deliver on something that had been teased for years. But, when Cody fans started taking the power back and making their discontent public on social media and in arenas, The Rock called an audible.\n\nFans' reactions were swift and vocal, leading to a reconsideration of the new plans for the show. But, it was The Rock who took the first action to make things right. He said he called Triple H, Nick Khan, and Ari Emanuel and said they could push through with a new main event -- something the Rock says happens a lot in wrestling -- or not force it. He figured there was a better way.\n\n\"My gut says, I don't like, even if it's a segment of fans, I don't like that they're upset, and that really bugged the s--t out of me. It's not how I've operated my entire career and I don't like it, and I knew that the choice, essentially, was mine. It was either we truck through this and make this main event, or we don't. I went with the latter and told those guys, 'Here's what I believe we should do.\"\n\nHe then said he pitched the idea that they go back to Roman vs. Cody and take care of those fans and let Cody finish his story. Eventually, he then pitched the idea that he become the Final Boss and what he called the greatest heel in pro wrestling.\n\nWWE Was Working On The Fly\n\nTriple H then said everyone got to work. The documentary showcased The Rock's genuine concern for fan sentiment and his desire to make things right. The original plan for WrestleMania was Seth Rollins vs. CM Punk and Cody vs Roman Reigns. With Punk injured, the opening was there to include Seth Rollins and The Rock said he and Brian Gewirtz came up with the idea to have a tag match.\n\nThe Rock's timing might have been off for WrestleMania 40, but his efforts to make amends were highlighted in the documentary. Whether fans buy into the fact that The Rock was the reason things were reverted back to Cody, or if his original plan backfired, the fact is, Cody is the champion and WWE is now set up for a huge showdown at WrestleMania 41.", "source": {"uri": "thesportster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSportster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_parsons@thesportster.com", "name": "Jim Parsons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_H", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple H"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCW_World_Heavyweight_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WCW World Heavyweight Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerslam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Powerslam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Tag_Team_Championship_(WWE)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Tag Team Championship (WWE)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Jericho", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Jericho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Cold_Steve_Austin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stone Cold Steve Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Intercontinental_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WWE Intercontinental Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayward,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hayward, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hayward, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ari_Emanuel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ari Emanuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Rollins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seth Rollins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CM_Punk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CM Punk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Indoor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Indoor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Rock,_Paper,_Scissors", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Rock, Paper, Scissors", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Resolers", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Resolers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/the-rock-wwe-wrestlemania-40-doc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701345", "eventUri": "eng-9701345", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1996-03-10", "textStart": 155, "textEnd": 165}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Reports suggest he may reappear around SummerSlam 2024, possibly setting up a feud with Solo Sikoa and the New Bloodline.\n\nThe ongoing saga promises to be a masterful storyline in WWE's recent history, ripe with potential for memorable moments and epic matches. Rumors even swirl about a potential showdown between Reigns and The Rock, marking a symbolic passing of the torch as \"The Head of the Table.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Rhodes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cody Rhodes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_XL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania XL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_Sikoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solo Sikoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_in_the_Bank_ladder_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money in the Bank ladder match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SummerSlam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tag team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Universal_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WWE Universal Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/safeimagekit-739773050_726751104_romnady-1024x576.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701345", "eventUri": "eng-9701345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

The former has been shooting a new film, doing movie star things and getting injured, while the latter has been taking some time off after dropping The WWE Championship and losing a singles match for the first time in more than three years in the main event of WrestleMania 40. Fortunately, Triple H and the rest of the creative team have weathered their absence nicely, thanks in part to Drew McIntyre doing the best work of his career and some fantastic turns from other key players like Cody Rhodes and Damian Priest.\n\nFor those of you who may not be watching wrestling on a weekly basis, let me recap quickly. The Rock and Roman Reigns are part of the same real life legendary wrestling family, which their villainous characters refer to as The Bloodline. Collectively, that family has main evented more than fifteen WrestleManias over the last four decades. Ahead of WrestleMania 40, they worked together to try and stop WWE's top babyface, or good guy character, Cody Rhodes from finally winning The WWE Championship in honor of his father. He was able to overcome, however, and Roman and The Rock went on hiatus the next week with the implication being they'd return to reclaim glory.\n\nIn their absence, however, WWE has started moving their story in a different direction. Solo Sikoa, Roman's younger cousin, has started systematically bringing in new family members, ones who are loyal to him. In addition, he's pushed out longtime Bloodline OGs and close Roman Reigns allies Jimmy Uso and Paul Heyman and recently declared himself Tribal Chief. It all seems to be building to Roman Reigns returning and confronting his cousin Solo about what's been going on.\n\nWe don't know exactly when Roman is going to return, but it'll almost certainly be as a surprise at one of WWE's major monthly events. The two most likely candidates are this Saturday's Money In The Bank (which I discuss here) or at SummerSlam in August. Fans are convinced and rightfully so that Solo's recent attack on Roman's longtime manager Paul Heyman, a character who isn't normally involved in anything physical, was simply too brutal for Reigns to ignore. His character wouldn't put up with that, nor would WWE want his character to seem like he would put up with it; so, therefore, he must be coming back soon.\n\nBut what does that mean for The Rock? Well, a certain percentage of WWE fans are convinced Solo Sikoa isn't actually acting on his own. They think The Rock is ordering him to remake The Bloodline so when he returns, he's in charge, not the longtime leader Roman Reigns. The People's Champion, while being outwardly subservient to Reigns since his return last year, has also planted enough seeds of doubt to make it clear he's not happy as a second in command. That's likely especially true after Reigns lost at WrestleMania and likely in his eyes, dishonored the family legacy.\n\nWe don't know exactly where any of this is going in the short-term, but the long-term path seems pretty clear. We are eventually going to get a Bloodline Civil War, likely with Roman Reigns and The Rock as leaders of rival factions of the family. Reigns will likely take the OG members Solo Sikoa kicked out, plus some other family members who left awhile ago like Jey Uso, and The Rock will take Solo Sikoa and this new army of vicious family members he has added including Jacob Fatu.\n\nI think it's unlikely we see The Rock and Roman Reigns return at the same time. I also think it's unlikely The Rock, with all his movie star commitments, is going to work a significant portion of the year. So, I suspect we'll see Roman Reigns return first, likely at SummerSlam in August. I think he'll start feuding with Solo Sikoa for a few months and then we'll see The Rock around Thanksgiving at Survivor Series. That would allow for a new injection of momentum into the storyline, and it would, in theory, allow The Rock to work the roughly four months between then and WrestleMania to build out a story and perhaps the most anticipated wrestling match ever against Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 41, which he's hinted at.\n\nOf course, that's all just still speculation at this point. So, we'll just have to watch for clues each week and wait for these huge returns to come at some point in the future.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mack_rawden@cinemablend.com", "name": "Mack Rawden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Rhodes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cody Rhodes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_Sikoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solo Sikoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloodline_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bloodline (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Priest", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damian Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_McIntyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew McIntyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Heyman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Heyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_H", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple H"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_match_types", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling match types"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Face (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SummerSlam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Usos", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Usos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Fatu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Fatu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Survivor Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feud_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Feud (professional wrestling)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nzoGQxUZfmWakaWb95CS8-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701345", "eventUri": "eng-9701345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

However, the match that garnered the most excitement was the main event between Cody Rhodes and Roman Reigns. The American Nightmare finally dethroned The Tribal Chief with the assistance of John Cena and The Undertaker and became world champion.\n\nCody Rhodes recently appeared on The Pivot podcast and expressed his desire to sit down with Roman Reigns and watch their encounter together. First, he praised Seth Rollins and stated that he had been his guy since he came back to WWE. Then, The American Nightmare talked about not getting a chance to sit down and chat with Reigns.\n\nRhodes stated that The Tribal Chief's family and his family share a certain connection in wrestling. He believed that his fight with Reigns for the WWE Undisputed title was written in destiny. The match was filled with many surprising moments and riveting in-ring action between two of the company's top stars. It ended with Reigns hitting Rollins with a chair, allowing Rhodes to hit three Cross Rhodes and win the title.\n\nMeanwhile, since winning the world title, the former Stardust has been a fighting champion. After beating AJ Styles and Logan Paul, he will wrestle in a 6-man tag team match against The Bloodline. Furthermore, according to several reports, the match between him and Solo Sikoa is earmarked for SummerSlam.\n\nEvery sport has four or five entities that have mastered their respective disciplines and accomplished everything there is to achieve. Similarly, Cody Rhodes recently discussed who he felt belonged on his Mount Rushmore of the wrestling industry.\n\nIn the same podcast, The American Nightmare chose The Rock, even after admitting that they weren't big fans of each other. Then he went on to add the names of John Cena, Ric Flair, and his father, Dusty Rhodes. The champ argued for placing Dusty on Mount Rushmore in wrestling, stating that his influence and legacy are still evident in the wrestling business.\n\nInterestingly, he didn't include his mentor and one of his best friends, Randy Orton on the list. Many fans are predicting that The Viper could soon turn heel and potentially betray Rhodes, kickstarting a new rivalry. However, they'll have to first tackle the Bloodline problem as they team up to face the faction this Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "firstsportz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FirstSportz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Rhodes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cody Rhodes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Reigns", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roman Reigns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Undertaker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Undertaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania_XL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania XL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WrestleMania", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WrestleMania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Rollins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seth Rollins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cena", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Cena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_thread", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Narrative thread"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJ_Styles", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AJ Styles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_tag_team_match_types", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling tag team match types"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutter_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cutter (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solo_Sikoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solo Sikoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bloodline_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bloodline (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SummerSlam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SummerSlam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Orton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Randy Orton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Rushmore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mount Rushmore"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ric_Flair", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ric Flair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cody-Rhodes-and-Roman-Reigns.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701345", "eventUri": "eng-9701345", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

When asked about the moment he had in Madison Square Garden on Friday night following SmackDown, where he got to hold up his championship in the same place his father did, Rhodes said that pro wrestling is at its best when it's real.\n\n\"Well, you'll hear this a lot about pro wrestling and sports entertainment. It's at its best when it's real,\" Cody Rhodes said. \"It's kind of funny to look at it that way because there's a suspension of disbelief in what we're doing. What's competitive, and what's performance? But with things like my story, I'm not able to be a character anymore in my life that's not really who I am.\n\n\"Just because they watched me grow up, they've seen some of the excursions I've taken and some of the things in the paths that I took to then come back to WWE, and truthfully, at eight years old, that was my goal. My goal was to do what I did last night, and I wish he had been alive for it and had that moment. But after his passing, the ball started rolling in a completely different way, and everything just started coming to me in unique and different routes than I thought.\n\n\"But I often get emotional on the microphone. There's a good chunk of wrestling fans who that is not what they are tuning in for. They are not into this dude up there crying all the time. They are not. But that was one of those ones, and I was happy that we did it for the MSG crowd. Of course, we'll blast it out everywhere, but just specifically to have that moment because the story was I was eight years old. I saw that picture. I wanted to be a pro wrestler.\n\n\"So I got to live the picture, and I got to keep it versus him getting all excited and holding it up there and then to have the heat of it being taken away. But he loved the Garden, and the Garden was really good to Dusty, and they didn't have to be. That's kind of how I look at all New York crowds. They don't have to be that way to you.\n\n\"Especially like Austin, Texas. This is a country boy, a redneck, and he vibed with them. So when he was alive, all he spoke about, if you could get him going about wrestling, is these three shots he had in Madison Square Garden. Those more than anything, more than Flair, more than anything, more than running his own company. It was just those three shots in the Garden. They changed his career.\"\n\nWhen asked prior to Friday when the last time he looked up and said something to his father was, Rhodes spoke about a moment that took place after his match against Roman Reigns at WrestleMania XL and revealed what he told his father that night.\n\n\"I think I got a little gun shy about fans,\" Cody Rhodes admitted. \"Fans online were starting to get to the point where, like, 'Okay, we get it. You're not the only wrestler with a family. Okay, bro, we get it. Your dad was in it. We get it.' And then other fans were like, 'No, we love this because we loved him, and we love this thread.'\n\n\"So I'd gotten a little gun shy about. I don't want my voice to crack; I don't want there to be this moment just because I got to kind of stand at Mania. I had a brief moment where I got to look up, and I'm very shocked that Michael Cole, or nobody, could pick up what I was saying. And maybe it was just the shot was so quick.\n\n\"Shout out to Michael Cole. He's the best commentator ever. But I looked up, and I said, 'Sorry it took me so long.' I think I had planned on saying a bazillion other things, but that's really how I felt. Because he was a believer, like, truthfully, not just dad, that's my boy. Like, he really thought, like, 'No, I think he's got it. He's just got to find it.' And then I did.

It dropped on YouTube a few hours ago, so let's get to it!\n\n-Run Time: 1:00:28\n\n-We start with HHH on the private jet talking about this being the biggest WrestleMania of all time as it is 40 years in the making. \"The pressure of it being WrestleMania is overwhelming.\" HHH notes the card on paper was probably 80% done in October and along the way, a lot of things happened. HHH: \"Something magical will come out of this chaos.\"\n\n-Opening!\n\n-Tom Rinaldi is the narrator for this doc which is cool as he is great at these. HHH meets with the staff at WWE HQ in Stamford as we are told that HHH is now the one in charge of WrestleMania's direction. He knows where he is going as WrestleMania is the North Star.\n\n-Cody Rhodes is jogging as we are told that he has been chasing the WWE Title for two years. One year ago at WrestleMania 39, Cody had his first chance at Roman and lost, which stunned everyone. Paul Heyman notes the audience was clamoring for the rematch as soon as the ref counted three to end the first match.\n\n-HHH says the intent was to give Cody a hot year to lead to Roman/Cody II at WrestleMania XL. They had the story planned out, but there was another blockbuster story out there. HHH says they had been talking about Roman/Rock for years. Here's the Rock and he says fans have been waiting for his match with Roman for years and they have been quietly building to it.\n\n-Rock talks about his history with Nick Khan and how they were kids in Hawaii going to Polynesian Pro-Wrestling. They bring up how they even teased Rock/Roman on The Young Rock TV show. I remember that tease. They nearly got a deal done for WrestleMania 39, but it didn't happen, so they decided to wait until XL. The Rock says it all started to dove tail and converge nicely after WWE and UFC merged to form TKO. Rock is friends with Ari Emanuel and he considers him his big brother. They discussed what value Rock could bring to the company.\n\n-Sept 15, 2023: The Rock shows up on The Pat McAfee show from Boulder, CO and they tease Rock/Roman for WrestleMania XL. The Rock then popped up on SmackDown that night in Denver and of course the crowd lost their minds. The Rock says everything was making sense and it seemed everything was set for Mania.\n\n-Jan 1, 2024: The Rock makes another surprise appearance at RAW: Day 1. We see Rock backstage hugging Nia and then Damian Priest. Rock says on paper the main event for Mania was Cody vs. Roman which they had building towards since the previous Mania, but they knew they had another Main Event. The Rock said he had to test the waters and drops the famous, \"should The Rock sit at the Head of The Table,\" line. HHH: \"That changes some things.\" We see footage of people freaking out on various podcasts about the idea of Rock/Roman at WrestleMania.\n\n-Roman Reigns had been Champion for nearly 4 years and Rock calls it an iconic run. Heyman says The Rock coming back presented them with a million other options. HHH says you can make an argument that Rock/Roman could be seen as a bigger match because of all the outside attention The Rock's presence would bring.\n\n-In January The Rock gets named to the TKO Board of Directors and tells everyone the business of WWE is what he loves the most. He has grown up in the business and it's in his DNA. We see HHH showing Rock some old WWF Titles (holding the Backlund one) and they take a picture together with that title. Rock notes he has a chance to make greater opportunities for the talent and wanting to make their relationships at home thrive. HHH shows Rock a photo hanging in the new HQ of Rocky Johnson and Tony Atlas with the Tag Titles and it causes Rock to squirt a few tears. He thanks HHH for that and gives him a hug.\n\n-HHH says they had a bunch of conversations with The Rock and they decided to continue The Cody/Roman story, but also explore what Rock/Roman could look like.\n\n-The Royal Rumble comes four days after The Rock joins the board. Now we catch back up with Cody who is still answering questions about finishing the story. HHH says he told Cody the afternoon before The Rumble that it was becoming more of a reality that Rock/Roman could be the Mania Main Event. He knows that had to crush Cody.\n\n-We catch the final few moments of The Rumble where Cody eliminates CM Punk to win his second straight Rumble Match. HHH notes that if Cody lost there, it would damage him, so he wanted to give him the win and see where the reactions went from there. Good call!\n\n-Cody knew the story was shifting when he showed up on RAW the next night and that explains his RAW promo. He admits he couldn't tell people how he felt and he no longer could believe anything unless he was standing in the ring and seeing it.\n\n-Cody's promo is interrupted by CM Punk and HHH notes that Seth's original opponent for WrestleMania was CM Punk. That verifies what we all assumed and what Punk said in his now infamous MMA Hour interview. We see Punk telling HHH about his injury after The Rumble. Punk: \"I hope I'm wrong, but I think I tore my triceps.\" What's wild is that injury was probably the best thing to happen for everyone including Punk as it has given him the fire feud with Drew McIntyre. Rollins throws out the idea of Cody challenging him at WrestleMania. The question is what does Cody do at Mania if Punk doesn't get hurt and faces Seth and they stick with Rock/Roman?\n\n-Cody is on his bus before SmackDown where he is going to announce his intentions and you can tell it is killing him inside. Later Cody tells Roman he wants the Title, but not at WrestleMania. That's the sound of a wet fart rolling through the crowd. The crowd quickly rebounds though as Cody brings out The Rock and steps aside so he can face Roman at WrestleMania. Rock says he had a nice moment with Cody in the ring and then he had the stare down with Roman with the crowd chanting \"This is Awesome.\"\n\n-The Rock goes back through Gorilla with everyone congratulating him and he gives a hug to Roman. HHH tells Roman that was great and tells Rock it was \"fucking bad ass.\" Rock says they will chat this week. Roman says the fans have been waiting for this and it's great to deliver on something like this.\n\n-Meanwhile Cody is on his bus and man, does he look so heartbroken. Cody says he has to believe he won't lose the faith of the fans. He can understand if some fans are upset. HHH notes Cody asked where it leaves him and he told him, \"not sure yet.\" HHH takes the blame and says that's on him and it's up to him to figure out as it is all happening in real time. He wanted to see what the reaction is.\n\n-The immediate reaction was podcast and YouTube personalities losing their minds over the idea of Rock/Roman. MY BOYS IN THE CLUTCH! Love their YouTube videos. Doubt they ever read this, but big fan over here. McAfee notes on his show that he is very torn about this as he loves Cody Rhodes.\n\n-The Rock says eventually the fans started voicing their concerns and #WeWantCody trended for 72 hours. HHH says if Rock/Roman happens in any other time or place it is the biggest match of all time, but the fans loved Cody and were invested in his story. The Rock says you can either truck through or listen to what the fans are saying.\n\n-We go to RAW and the crowd is chanting for Cody and we are getting \"Rocky Sucks,\" chants. The Rock decided they needed to pivot. He knew they could pull in the fans outside the bubble with Rock/Roman and he notes it would be the first chapter of a few, but his gut told him it was a mistake to have a segment of the fans upset. He didn't like a segment of the fans being upset and it bothered him. He admits the decision was ultimately his and he felt they needed to give the fans Cody finishing his story.\n\n-The Rock appears of McAfee on 02.08.24 (as they were in Vegas for Super Bowl week and thanks for reminding me about that game. My Niners will back!) and they start the new plan with Rock leaning heel as he calls Cody's passionate fans, \"Cody Crybabies.\" Just like that an insult was born. McAfee says it was awesome to see Rock drop back into being Rock so easily. HHH says they all agreed on the new plan and wanted to blur the lines of fiction and reality.\n\n-WrestleMania XL Kick-Off: Press Event. The WWE decided to hold a press conference during Super Bowl week and broadcast it live on YouTube and Peacock. My live recap of the event is here and I again, thank everyone that joined me. This was absolutely amazing as they teased Rock/Roman, before Cody called bullshit and took his rightful place in the WrestleMania Main Event. Roman brings up Dusty, so Cody feels it is fair game to bring up Sika (Rest in Peace sir), who was still alive then, and brings up Rock's grandfather. He notes they would be ashamed, so Rock SLAPS THE PISS OUT OF CODY'S MOUTH! FANTASTIC!\n\n-The Rock told HHH he had a thought so they hashed out what they wanted to do. They discussed the idea of a Triple Threat, but Rock spoke to Brian Gewirtz (former head writer of WWE) and the idea was to do a Tag Match on Night One with the outcome impacting the Main Event of Night Two.\n\n-We jump to a photo shoot off all four men to build towards the new plan. We see them shooting the Super Bowl commercial that teased what was coming even though the Tag Match had not been announced yet. They discuss the beauty of Mania being two nights now and how they can be more creative. They don't say it here, but it also nicely ties into what happened to close WrestleMania X, XX, and XXX. It's crazy what they keep stumbling into and we can start guessing what could happen at WrestleMania L.\n\n-The Rock was in Hawaii and called Nick and Ari and told them they would see Rock 10.0 as The Final Boss. Nick and Ari told him they loved it and for him to go for it. That brings the return of UPPER DICK HOLLYWOOD ROCK! The Rock back with his old swagger and gear was amazing as he tore up the crowd and Cody every week.\n\n-Oh yeah, Seth is injured as he suffered a torn MCL and meniscus in his left knee. He is happy it didn't cost him WrestleMania and he feels confident he will be 100%. We see Seth working out in the ring and testing out a brace. He is cool with the brace, but is hoping it is gone by Mania.\n\n-The Rock is at Gorilla talking to the tech people and sound people to work out the kinks of his new entrance to fit his new character. Stuff like this is sweet! They discuss whether there should be a mark for The Rock when he makes his entrance. Rock notes he is confident he can hit it without the mark as he doesn't want it shown on camera. We then see the entrance proper and it's cool seeing it come together after hearing them talk about it.\n\n-Cody is at a live event in Louisiana and says he isn't sure how long this is going to last as business is as hot as it has ever been. It has been up to him to lead as Champion without being The Champion. He loves doing it and won't change. He knows if he didn't have the connection he does with the people, Rock would be facing Roman. The biggest star on the planet had to wait because the fans were so invested in Cody.\n\n-They pat themselves on the back (and really, they should) about the string of sell-outs on RAW and SmackDown. They also show Rock on the talk show circuit and discussing how he has been roasting each city. Oh Phoenix got raked! ROCK CONCERT! How can you now love Final Boss/Hollywood Rock? Rock says he has never received so many calls and texts about his Final Boss character and Rock just decided he needed to do it his way.\n\n-RAW: March 25: RAW gets dark as Rock just beats the dog out of Cody in the rain with a weight belt while dropping F bombs all over the place. They even include the stuff that happened after RAW went off the air and Rock dropped more F bombs. The man had to be having the time of his life. The Rock notes the only thing that matters is if The Final Boss is entertaining to the fans. HHH says when you put all those creative minds together it makes something magical, and nothing can touch it.\n\n-We are a few days before Mania and Cody has a dinner with his friends and family. I assume Ricky Starks may have been there, but I didn't catch him on camera anywhere. Cody talks about how they are back a year later and have made it.\n\n-WrestleMania XL: Night One: I was supposed to be there for both shows, but everyone that could go with me, backed out due to cost. Roman is working on his cardio on a treadmill and notes what they are creating is art to him. Of note, one of the Televisions has Tiger Woods' miracle win at The Masters in 2019. I still have that entire round on DVR.\n\n-The Rock, with his People's Champion Belt, meets up with HHH in Gorilla and they both want to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. I guess we are skipping The Hall of Fame where Rock made it about him and cussed out a fan to end the show.\n\n-We skip everything else on the card because this isn't their story and get to the Tag Main Event. Good for Seth for finally getting his WrestleMania Main Event. I mean, he was likely getting it with Punk anyway, but it's cool for him to check that one off the list. Props to Rock as well for working his ass off after being out the ring for so long. Rock pins Cody to set the stage for Night Two. Sure, it ended Night One on a downer, but there was a bigger story being told and everyone there knew it.\n\n-WrestleMania XL: Night Two: Cody points out Dusty on one of the production trucks and how he is sporting his million dollar smile. HHH is on stage working out the details with Roman's special entrance. Again, I am a sucker for all this backstage technical stuff!\n\n-Again, we jump to the Main Event and the show up to this point was already better than the previous night with a more engaged crowd. Now, I am sure the warmer temps probably helped the crowd. There were all kinds of twists and turns, but once the bell rang, we got the match we needed. We see HHH and Prichard on headsets back in Gorilla. Their match at 39 was technically a better match, but this one had the better story and obviously the epic ending. It is going to get my vote for Match of The Year.\n\n-AVENGERS ASSEMBLE! Jimmy Uso saves Roman, but here's Jey to spear him off the stage and through a table. Solo saves Roman like last year, but John Cena is here to get his revenge and put Solo through a table. Here's The Rock to give us Mania XXVIII and XXIX flashbacks. Rock sends Cena packing and then we hear The Shield's music. Seth hobbles into the ring and eats a spear from Seth. The Rock is standing tall and hey, here's THE UNDERTAKER as the crowd is just losing their minds. Sure, Austin would have been great, but this was still perfect. The best part was Roman having flashbacks when seeing Seth and blasting him with a chair to callback to 10 years earlier when Seth broke up The Shield. Seth even falling the same way Roman fell was Chef's Kiss. That lets Cody get the win and I tweeted out I LOVE PRO-WRESTLING when Cody won the WWE Title. I will proudly say it again, I LOVE PRO-WRESTLING.\n\n-Cody walks backstage with The Title on his shoulder and gets congratulated by everyone. Cody says he thought when he won, he would feel complete. We see Cody taking picture with HHH. Cody says his first though was \"what do we do next with this?\"\n\n-The answers are already in process as the next night, The Rock lets Cody know their story had just begun.\n\n-HHH at the post show press conference noting on every metric this is the biggest Mania of all time. Well, other than attendance, but we know what he meant. He tells the documentary crew that he is already trying to piece together where they go for WrestleMania XLI.\n\n-And that's how we end. As always, WWE crushes it with these documentaries. This one seemed a bit rushed at the end as I was hoping to get a little more of Cody's in ring celebration with all The Avengers and pick up things they were all saying to each other. They have always done these documentaries after Mania and they usually touch on all the matches with a handful getting the main focus. I enjoyed how this year they knew the story was more about how they got to this Mania and all the turns it took. As I mentioned, I loved all the production meetings they had and the footage of them working on entrances and figuring out how to shoot things. This was mainly the story of The Rock, Cody, and HHH with Seth and Roman being the co-stars. This is definitely worth a watch as you don't get a chance to see stuff change so quickly in real time as Rock noted that in wrestling, they have a history of just plowing ahead. I tend to think if Vince was still in charge they would have, but he did pivot at Mania XXX (which also happened because of Punk being MIA). With that one though, Batista vs. Orton was an awful choice to headline a Mania. As they said here, the fans want Rock/Roman, but just not this year. I still would like to know what Cody was going to do at Mania if Punk never gets hurt and Rock/Roman happens. Not having The Rumble winner in either World Title match seems bizarre. I guess Punk/Rollins could have turned into Punk/Rollins/Cody? No matter as we got what we all deserved in the end and based off this I assume we are getting Rock/Roman next year in Vegas, but who knows? We have some time before we get there.

Rhodes has clearly heard some of the comparisons to Homelander, so Rhodes introduced Homelander to the American Nightmare in an amazing new video ad for The Boys season 4. Footage of Homelander and Rhodes is spliced together in the video, with Rhodes eventually turning around and asking, \"So Homelander, what do you want to talk about?\" Rhodes' eyes then glow red, previewing a battle that everyone would love to see. You can see the video below.\n\nWith the bleach blonde hair and the red, white, and blue gear, you can see why there have been so many comparisons of Rhodes to Homelander, at least aesthetically. As characters the two couldn't be more different, and Rhodes is up for the eventual showdown. Plus, those powers will come in handy in his next Title defense, so really it's a win-win. The caption for the post reads \"Homelander, you just met your American Nightmare! Watch all new episodes of The Boys streaming now on Prime Video. #ad @theboystv @primevideo.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Cody Rhodes (@americannightmarecody)\n\nWhat's Next For Rhodes\n\nWe'll have to wait and see if we ever get a true Rhodes vs Homelander battle in the ring, but Rhodes has a full plate regardless. Rhodes was able to defeat AJ Styles at Backlash, but shortly after was targeted by The Bloodline. That would be the new Bloodline though, as Roman Reigns isn't currently leading the ship. Reigns has been absent from WWE since losing to Rhodes at WrestleMania 40, and in his absence, the Bloodline has been taken over by Solo Sikoa.\n\nSikoa has taken Reigns' absence and run with it, stepping in as the leader of the group and drafting his own members, and he started that run by kicking out Jimmy Uso. Sikoa bought in someone to help with that as well in Tama Tonga, and then a few weeks later Tonga Loa made his surprise debut as the next member of the faction. The final piece of the puzzle was revealed recently, as Sikoa brought in Jacob Fatu to the group.\n\nFatu made a massive impression when he debuted, as he attacked Rhodes, Randy Orton, and Kevin Owens. All three of SmackDown's top babyface fell in one swoop to The Bloodline, and Owens, Orton, and Rhodes will look to get some payback on them at Money in the Bank, where they will face the trio in a six-man Tag Team match.\n\nMoney in the Bank Card\n\nWorld Heavyweight Championship Match: Damian Priest (C) vs. Seth \"Freakin\" Rollins\n\nUndisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton and Kevin Owens vs. The Bloodline\n\nMen's Money in the Bank Ladder Match: LA Knight vs. Drew McIntyre vs. Carmelo Hayes vs. Chad Gable vs. Jey Uso vs. Andrade\n\nWomen's 2024 Money in the Bank Ladder Match: Iyo Sky vs. Bianca Belair vs. Tiffany Stratton vs. Naomi vs. Zoey Stark vs. Chelsea Green\n\nIntercontinental Championship Match: Sami Zayn (C) vs. Bron Breakker\n\nAre you excited for Money in the Bank?

This urge comes from the fact that the legend has never experienced perfect closure among the WWE audience. But due to health reasons, he's no longer intending to lace up the boots.\n\nIt appears that The Undertaker would be open to making future WWE appearances in one-off segments like the one he made at WrestleMania 40. However, he's not at all interested in getting involved in storylines to build up toward a full-fledged match inside the squared circle. Hence, the fans have to contend with the fact that they have already seen the last of perhaps the best sports entertainers of all time.\n\nMercedes Mone Allegedly \"Was Difficult To Work With\" In Her WWE Days\n\nDuring an appearance on Insight with Chris Van Vliet, The Undertaker was asked if the WrestleMania 40 cameo raised back etch within him for wrestling one more match. In response, it was clearly mentioned that he's retired and will never compete in another match. But, being under a lifetime contract with the WWE, if the company needed him to make such a cameo appearance, he'd be open to doing it.\n\n\"Yeah, I could do it. I couldn't do it to the standard that I wanted to do it,\" The Undertaker was clear about his wrestling status.\n\n\"But, I mean, yeah, there's certain things that I don't feel like I would be able to do. After I did it [the WrestleMania 40 appearance], I came back and I was like, 'I'm good now. I don't need to do this again.' Not saying that I wouldn't -- if they needed something like that again -- but I'm not going to have a match or I'm not coming out of retirement.\"\n\nRoyal Rumble Internally Touted As Two-Night WWE Premium Live Event\n\nThe last match featuring The Undertaker career took place at WrestleMania 36, where he defeated AJ Styles in a cinematic Boneyard Match. Being a pre-taped match, this match took place without an audience and he could not agree to terms with retirement given this fact. However, he was back at WrestleMania 40 in front of a packed stadium crowd.\n\nAs seen at the 2024 edition of Wrestlemania, The Undertaker got involved in the night two main event by helping Cody Rhodes to get over the interference created by The Bloodline.

Recently, the Undisputed WWE Champion was asked to name his Mount Rushmore, sparking much discussion.\n\nSpeaking to The Pivot Podcast, Cody Rhodes named his Mount Rushmore, featuring John Cena, Ric Flair, his current rival The Rock, and his father Dusty Rhodes.\n\n\"My Mount Rushmore just from a feeling is... I can't believe I'm going to say this because he's not a fan of mine and I'm not a fan of his but one of the heads is going to be The Rock.\n\n\"In addition to that it's going to be John Cena. It's going to be the Nature Boy Ric Flair, then it's going to be my dad.\"\n\n\"The cool thing about putting dad in Mount Rushmore is I can always make an argument. If people want to get into these 'objective' conversations, I'm like 'cool take a look at the show now.' His footprints are there more than anyone else's.

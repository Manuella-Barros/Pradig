The singer grew up in Barbados with her two younger brothers, Rorrey and Rajad, and parents, Ronald Fenty and Monica Braithwaite. She also has three older siblings \u2014 sisters Kandy and Samantha and brother Jamie \u2014 from her father's previous relationships. While Rihanna's older siblings have remained more private, her younger brothers have stepped into the spotlight with the singer, appearing on red carpets together and supporting her various musical and business endeavors over the years. In November 2021, when Rihanna was declared a National Hero of Barbados, her brother Rorrey celebrated the milestone on Instagram by calling his sister his \"hero.\" \"My Hero! The Right Excellent Robyn Rihanna Fenty! National Hero Of Barbados,\" he wrote alongside a photo of the artist. Rihanna shares an equally close bond with her youngest brother Rajad, whom she has even referred to as her \"son.\" From their childhood in Barbados to Rorrey's self-proclaimed \"funcle\" status, here is everything to know about Rihanna's five siblings. Rihanna and brothers Rorrey and Rajad were raised in Barbados Rihanna and her younger brothers, Rorrey and Rajad, were raised in a bungalow in Barbados by their parents, Ronald and Monica. In 2012, Rihanna returned to Barbados for an episode of Oprah's Next Chapter, where she gave Oprah Winfrey a tour of her childhood home. During the tour, she revealed that she shared a room with her brother and mom. When Rihanna was 14, her parents divorced, in part due to Ronald's struggles with addiction. \u201cHe taught me everything, and as awful as he was to my mom, at times, it didn\u2019t compare to how great he was as a father,\" the \"Diamonds\" singer told Oprah. \"And I had to come to terms with that, and I was able to close that gap with him.\u201d In 2018, Rihanna shared a photo with both of her parents on Instagram with the simple caption, \"home.\" Rihanna has three older siblings through her father Before becoming a father to Rihanna, Rorrey and Rajad, Ronald had three children from previous relationships: daughters Kandy and Samantha and son Jamie. The Grammy Award-winning singer was reportedly introduced to her half-siblings at different times in her childhood. Most of her siblings stay out of the spotlight Rihanna\u2019s three older half-siblings \u2014 Kandy, Samantha and Jamie \u2014 lead a more low-key life than their megastar sister. Her younger brother, Rorrey, however, has been a bit more public. He currently serves on the Board of Directors for Barbados Tourism Marketing Inc. He has also hosted several events on the island, including Lost in Paradise and Imagine Weekend. Rihanna shares a close bond with younger brother Rajad Rihanna grew up close to her siblings and even said her younger brother Rajad felt like a \"son\" to her in a post on X (formerly Twitter). In an interview with Oprah in 2012, Rihanna said that she would treat Rajad when he did well in school. \u201cHe\u2019s so disciplined and ... he loves anything to do with biology, anything to do with internet,\" she said. \"He\u2019s been into technology since he was about 7 years old.\u201d Rajad was reportedly the first of Rihanna\u2019s brothers to have a child, as he and his girlfriend revealed they were pregnant in 2020. Rorrey and Rajad call Rihanna by her birth name, Robyn While the world knows her simply as Rihanna, the \"Umbrella\" singer was born Robyn Rihanna Fenty. When speaking to Oprah in 2012, the Fenty founder shared that her mother Monica and younger brothers still called her Robyn. They are supportive of Rihanna's endeavors The family also has supported the star in her rise to fame. \u201cThey are very supportive. They are obviously very excited, you know, it\u2019s not that they\u2019re completely unphased by it. But they\u2019re not affected by it,\u201d Rihanna told Oprah in 2012. That support has continued beyond her music career and into her business and philanthropic endeavors, such as the Fenty x Puma Fall 2016 show in New York and her annual Clara Lionel Foundation Diamond Ball. Rihanna's mother Monica told Vogue in 2017 that the family was raised to give back. \u201cWe were always a family of giving back,\u201d Monica told the outlet. \u201cWhen you are raised with empathy, you start small ... and she would grow.\" Rorrey cheered on Rihanna during the 2023 Super Bowl Halftime Show Rorrey was among the crowd at the 2023 Super Bowl, where Rihanna performed during the halftime show. The supportive brother wore a shirt that read: \"Rihanna concert interrupted by a football game, weird but whatever.\" He shared a photo of him with a small child in the stands with the caption, \"Fam Affair.\" Rihanna also took her performance as an opportunity to announce some exciting news of her own: her second pregnancy with partner A$AP Rocky. The singer showed off her growing baby bump in a red close-fitting bodysuit and matching bandeau. Rajad is a father In 2021, Rajad welcomed his first and only child with his partner, the musician Nora. \"2020 has been full of its twists and turns as well as its blessings but this may just be the biggest blessing of them all and I am happy and thankful that we are able to welcome this new life into the world and into our families,\" he wrote on Instagram announcing the pregnancy. Now 3 years old, Rajad's child is seemingly close to Rihanna's two children, RZA and Riot. In May 2024, Nora shared photos of the family at RZA's second birthday at the Color Factory in New York City. Rorrey considers himself a \"funcle\" Rorrey has dubbed himself as a \"funcle\" on Instagram many times. In January 2022, he posted a photo of himself holding one of his nephews with the caption, \"Funcle 4L.\" Just a few days later, when Rihanna announced her first pregnancy, she shared a shot of the singer showing off her bump and wrote, \"FUNCLE Pt. 2 ??????.\" Rorrey has also documented some of his time spent with Rihanna's children on social media.

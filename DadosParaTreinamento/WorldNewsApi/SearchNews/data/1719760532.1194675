{"id": 225348964, "title": "An Insider\u2019s Guide to the Golden Era of UK Hip-Hop", "text": "In the UK, hip-hop culture started emerging in the early 80s with rappers, DJs, graffiti writers and breakdancers taking their cues from what was happening stateside and putting their own spin on it. Crews formed across the country as like-minded people started making music together and building communities. And in London, there was a British-Jamaican teenager with a film camera documenting it all. Normski Anderson grew up in north-west London. His parents bought him a camera when he was 10 years old, and he began photographing friends, family, and everything that was happening around him. His mum and stepdad both worked for Transport for London and brought darkroom equipment home from the Transport Photography Centre, which they set up in the bathroom. \u201cI\u2019d bunk off school just take to pictures and go and do fucking printing in my darkroom while my mum was at work,\u201d he remembers. \u201cEveryone now talks about OCD and ADHD \u2013 I had all of that. The dark room was a way for me to release all of that. I\u2019d be in there all day, sometimes all night.\u201d Normski was drawn to hip-hop and street culture after seeing Beat Street in 1984, a coming-of-age film about rappers, DJs and breakdancers in New York. \u201cWe were like, oh my God?!\u201d he says. \u201cThose guys are in matching tracksuits, they\u2019ve got colourful trainers, headbands on, they\u2019re spinning on the floor. They look like acrobats... We want to be part of that!\u201d He soon found himself shooting live shows every weekend, taking press shots for local rappers and photographing breakers as they busked in central London. \u201cI was touched by it,\u201d he says. \u201cI saw people that looked like me, and that made me feel like this is the place for me now. I've finally got something for me. That\u2019s really why I fell into it with open arms.\u201d Looking back, he now realizes that he was one of the only people photographing the burgeoning scene in which he was embedded. He explains: \u201cA load of my photos are just portraits of young, mostly Black, inner-city kids. This was a time in culture and society where, had I not taken these photographs, there would have been a whole lot less photographs of that scene.\u201d He began getting his snaps published in the seminal British magazine Hip Hop Connection and soon became an integral part of the team there. \u201cWithout the adrenalin shot of Normski\u2019s imagery, Hip Hop Connection might never have made it to a second edition,\u201d remembers Andy Cowan, the magazine\u2019s editor from 1989 to 2009. As the culture grew, Normski landed a job presenting Dance Energy, a magazine show on BBC2 that covered music, fashion, skateboarding and youth culture. By this point, the scene had ascended from the deep underground to within touching distance of the mainstream. \u201cWe'd never have thought back then that the thing we were into would blow up,\u201d says Normski. \u201cWe just created our own world, you know, like all subcultures do. You're forced to create your own culture.\u201d He knew things were changing when he heard a hip-hop beat used as the incidental music on BBC News, as well as Masterchef. \u201cNow, all these years later, there\u2019s mums walking around in fucking puma tracksuits! Now everyone's on it. You can't control it. Every motherfucker, no matter what colour you are or where you come from,\u201d he says. His dedication to documenting Black culture took him from the early days of UK hip-hop to shooting big stars from the States like Public Enemy and De La Soul. He saw it all, from the sound system culture of Notting Hill Carnival right through to the birth of techno. \u201cI tried to capture the essence of a lot of artists in their early days. Some of which have turned into mega stars. Some of which are sadly no longer with us,\u201d says Normski. His life\u2019s work has now been compiled in a book, The Man With The Golden Shutter, published by ACC Art Books. \u201cI see my book as a celebration, really. A celebration of a movement from its very early stages.\u201d Below, we asked him to talk us through a few of the most impactful photos. \u201cThis is Hijack the Terrorist Group from South London. They took no prisoners. Ulysses [left], who sadly passed away last month, was a really important part of the group. He didn\u2019t rap or DJ, but he was the overseer of the yin and yang, the balance. I loved the white guy who was part of the crew \u2013 you can just about make him out. He\u2019s got a fucking stocking over his head like he was going to rob a bank! It couldn\u2019t get any rougher. \u201cWhat I love about this is that they brought a fucking broad sword to the photoshoot. This was available as a poster in the UK for about a week, but then the fucking IRA did some work at Harrods and it was deemed in bad taste to have guys in balaclavas. \u201cWe had to climb a 15 to 20 feet wall to get into this spot. It was all derelict buildings. A couple of police came from nowhere \u2013 I don\u2019t know how they got onto the plot. I said I was doing a college project about these rappers. They told us to finish up the shoot and get off the land, and get rid of the swords otherwise they were going to arrest us. On my shoots it\u2019s about capturing a moment in time, and sometimes I think the less time you have the more you emphasise the moment.\u201d \u201cThese [Cookie Crew] were part of the first major signings. Along with Monie Love and a few others, these girls were smashing it \u2013 they were a very big part of it. At the time, I wanted to get some of those dynamic American shots, and one of the things I love about British artists is that they\u2019re not quite American, so you don\u2019t quite get that dynamic. \u201cThis was taken at Camden Town Hall for Hip-Hop Alliance. That was fronted by a guy called Ricky Rennalls \u2013 he saw the light and realised that hip-hop was a good thing for young people to get them off the streets. He had this space for young people to learn to DJ, do graffiti and dance. I owe a lot to Ricky Rennalls and Hip-Hop Alliance. They were keen and they saw me as a young Black photographer and invited me down.\u201d \u201cThis is the perfect example of intimidating your environment. This is in front of the Lloyds Bank building, which was new at the time. This photo is in the V&A archives now; it\u2019s seen as an example of 1990s street style. The different races, the different fashion, haircuts, everything.\u201d \u201cThis is what we used to call a bum-rush. The gig was totally oversold, and it was a small venue for a massive band. The bookers just thought hip-hop was a fad, like skateboarding was in the 70s. The rush came in so hard and fast, I had to jump up out of the crowd so I didn\u2019t get crushed. These youths would\u2019ve done anything to see the Ultramagnetic MCs. They did the show with the back door open in the end. \u201cA lot of groups would come from the US and wouldn\u2019t realise they had a fanbase over here; that there were people like them who were into the music. Hip-hop made these really big gaps between people smaller, and brought people together through music.\u201d These photos were taken from The Man With The Golden Shutter, which is out now on ACC Art Books UK.", "summary": "Normski\u2019s photography preserves Black British street culture of the 1980s and 1990s.

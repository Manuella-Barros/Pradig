Among them is much-needed development in the Eastside neighborhood.\n\nAll that said, this deal is going to happen. Or should I say, it's on track toward happening.\n\nIt'll become reality for one reason above all: Jaguars' owner Shad Khan, Deegan and all the important players working for each party deem a renovated stadium too critical to Jacksonville's future for it to die at the 11 hour.\n\nMake no mistake, it's close to fish-or-cut-bait time. Nearly eight years of Jaguars' research, the dozens of community huddles explaining why a renovated stadium is necessary to keep the team in Jacksonville, the well-known cost of doing business with the NFL and consequences of losing a franchise, all of that is approaching a finish line.\n\nMore: Gene Frenette: Jaguars' first-round pick Thomas has legitimate shot to set rookie receiving mark\n\n'A good investment'\n\nSometime in May, likely as soon as next week, a proposal for how this $1.4 billion pie gets divided comes out of the shadows and into the public light.\n\nOf course, it's all subject to negotiations that can move each side's financial obligation up or down. But the gist of a deal has already been heavily discussed by representatives from the Jaguars and the city, so nobody is going to get blindsided when the numbers come out.\n\nCity Councilman Matt Carlucci, who has served for 17 years, has been part of numerous Jaguars' negotiations in his political career. He's prepared for grumbling no matter the taxpayers' portion of the bill. Carlucci, who doesn't know the specific number, remains optimistic the public will see more benefits than drawbacks of reaching an agreement on a massive stadium upgrade.\n\nAs a Republican who supported Deegan, a Democrat, when she ran for office, Carlucci likes the way the negotiation winds are blowing.\n\n\"I'm not expecting the worst,\" Carlucci told the Times-Union. \"I know this will be expensive, but I feel it will be viewed as good news by the public. I have a good feeling about what's going to be proposed.\n\n\"Is everybody going to love it? No. But I think five years down the road, people will look back at it and say, 'This is a good investment.' \"\n\nPro-active approach suits both sides\n\nIt's not like the Jaguars or the city went into two-minute offense mode to push this stadium deal forward.\n\nBoth sides understood the enormous stakes a long time ago and prepared accordingly. The Jaguars, especially President Mark Lamping, have been meticulous in their resolve to make everybody aware that a renovated stadium (hundreds of millions of dollars cheaper than brand new ones in Buffalo and Nashville) is necessary to keep the team in Jacksonville.\n\nWhile some people take that as a threat, the truth is it's the economic reality of playing in the NFL. The Jaguars are the last team in the league to not build a new or renovated stadium or reach an agreement on one.\n\nDeegan, a newcomer to the political game, didn't act like she had all the answers to getting a stadium resolution, so the city hired some big guns to ensure a fair deal with the Jaguars could be executed.\n\nThe Sidley Austin law firm it brought in worked on behalf of the state of New York in its finalized negotiations with the Buffalo Bills ownership. That firm is also involved in ongoing negotiations with the Chicago Bears' proposal to build a domed stadium on the lakefront, which figure to be far more contentious than Jacksonville.\n\nBoth Weinstein and former Jaguars' executive Michael Huyghue, an NFL consultant hired to work on the city's behalf, have also navigated through their share of high-profile negotiations where big public dollars are at stake.\n\nWhile the Jaguars and the city are careful not to say an agreement is a foregone conclusion, both sides are happy how things are progressing.\n\n\"Things have gone well right from the beginning,\" Weinstein said. \"It was obvious the Jaguars want to stay here and the city wants them to stay here.\n\n\"We've been trying to figure out how to fairly reach a 30-year [lease] agreement on the biggest project the city will have done. It's continuing to move forward nicely, as smoothly and timely as others, if not quicker.\"\n\nApproaching a time crunch\n\nThe Jaguars are hopeful of finalizing an agreement with the city by early summer, which would allow the NFL plenty of time to evaluate it before their mid-October owners meeting.\n\nCoincidentally, the timeline for owners to ratify an agreement between Jacksonville and the city would fall right in the middle of the Jaguars' back-to-back London games against the Chicago Bears and a likely non-division AFC opponent.\n\nThe owners' vote should be a formality as neither the Jaguars or the city would hammer out an agreement they didn't expect to get owner approval.\n\nConsidering the price tags for new stadiums in Buffalo and Nashville, which will be more expensive for taxpayers there, Lamping believes Jacksonville going the renovation route makes it easier to accept.\n\n\"It's a ton of money, but in today's NFL stadium game,\" said Lamping, \"it's a real good value to spend $1.4 billion and get a 30-year lease going into a renovated building.\"\n\nWhy this is a must-get-done deal\n\nWhether Jacksonville taxpayers view the investment numbers with sticker shock or merely as the price of doing NFL business, the unmistakable reality is losing the Jaguars would carry a heavier price than paying for a renovated stadium.\n\nAs much as Jacksonville has struggled for decades to develop downtown, can you imagine how much harder that task becomes if Khan - the city's biggest single investor - were to move his team elsewhere because a stadium agreement fell through?\n\nJust ask football fans in St. Louis, Baltimore and Cleveland, two of which got NFL teams back, how much it stung when their owners packed up and left. Those are bigger markets than Jacksonville, which was lucky to get an expansion franchise in 1995 and might wait decades or longer to get another NFL team if Khan felt compelled to move.\n\nRemember, too, Jacksonville is the only NFL market besides Green Bay with one major pro sports team. Losing the Jaguars would be a crippling blow, both financially and to the city's self-image.\n\nIt's not that an NFL team brings in a ton of jobs, but the economic ripple effect for Jacksonville of not having the Jaguars would be significant.\n\nHow long do you think the Florida-Georgia game, with its economic impact of $35 million, would remain viable here without a renovated EverBank Stadium?\n\n\"It'd be gone, and we'd probably lose our game, too,\" said TaxSlayer Gator Bowl president Greg McGarity, the former athletic director at Georgia. \"College football would cease to exist in Jacksonville because of competition from more attractive venues.\"\n\nA state-of-the-art stadium isn't just a benefit for the Jaguars, but for other sporting events and concerts that help drive the city's economic engine.\n\nWithout a renovated EverBank, the chances for development around that venue with office space, restaurants and other amenities -- all of which were tabled for the city and Jaguars to focus on the stadium issue -- goes away as well.\n\nLook, it's Jacksonville's turn to decide how much it values the Jaguars' 29-year existence. On the longshot possibility the city decides not to pony up to make sure the Jaguars are available for another generation of fans, losing the team would represent incalculable damage on multiple fronts.\n\nAnd if anybody thinks the Jaguars would stick around until the 2029 season conclusion when the current lease expires without a stadium agreement, forget it. The team would be gone well before then because Khan isn't likely waiting to move to his next destination.\n\nLuckily, the city likely won't have to deal with that nightmarish hypothetical. The inescapable conclusion is Jacksonville knows it's much better off with the Jaguars than without them.\n\n\"I'm sure it's going to have quite the price tag and people will have all sorts of opinions [on the taxpayer cost],\" said Carlucci. \"But the overriding issue is keeping the Jaguars in Jacksonville. Period. Losing the Jaguars would probably be one of the biggest gut punches in our history.\"\n\nKeeping the Jaguars will be expensive, but not as much as the price of losing them. That's why this renovated stadium must, and will, get done.", "source": {"uri": "eu.jacksonville.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Treasure Coast Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The stadium will include state of the art technology and a shade canopy to reduce heat retention by 70%.\n\nAs for other opportunities to improve the stadium? In announcing the stadium design last year, the franchise said the following changes will be made:\n\nShade on all seatsA 360-degree concourse\n\nWider concoursesIncreased space for football operationsBetter vertical transportationReplace HVAC, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical systems\n\nThe Jaguars, rumored for years to be a potential relocation franchise to London, have plans to remain in Jacksonville for the long term. The franchise chose to renovate EverBank Stadium instead of building a new one once the organization concluded it was structurally possible. This redesign will also put Jacksonville in line to again host a Super Bowl, which the city hasn't done since Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005.\n\nThe Jaguars constructed a state-of-the-art, 125,000-square-foot sports performance center as part of the team's renovation plan, which was unveiled during training camp last year. The new practice facility included locker rooms, team and positional meeting rooms, training and recovery areas, medical support facilities, weight room, dining facilities, office space and a draft room. Two full-size grass practice fields and a full-size indoor practice field are also set to be a part of the new training complex.\n\nThe renovated stadium will be the centerpiece of the Jaguars' facility reconstruction, showcasing the franchise's commitment to the city.

The Council expects to receive a complete agreement soon thereafter. My colleagues and I will begin a process to vet and finalize a stadium and lease agreement that is fair for the citizens of Jacksonville and will secure the Jaguars as our team for decades to come,\" Salem said in a statement.\n\nBeyond that, details are elusive. Salem, unlike the Deegan administration, responded immediately to a public records request regarding documentation of the deal, saying he didn't have anything.\n\nSalem did address the timing, noting that the Mayor's Office will begin \"town hall\" meetings to sell the proposal next Wednesday, and that the goal was to \"make sure Council had the facts\" on the deal before then.\n\nHe stressed that this is an agreement between the administration and the Jaguars, and he will not be at the town hall events where Deegan will try to sell the deal.\n\nThe Mayor's Office isn't going out of its way to provide draft documents as Sunshine laws would require, meanwhile, compounding the mystery.\n\n\"We have reached an agreement on the framework of a deal. The negotiating team is currently putting the final details on paper, and we will release that information as soon as it is available,\" Deegan said in a statement from her office.\n\nThe Jaguars and the Shad Khan vehicle \"Iguana Investments\" previously envisioned a total investment that could cost as much as $2.068 billion, a number that could include stadium improvements costing between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, as well as between $550 and $668 million for development of a \"sports district,\" an option supposedly off the table.\n\nJacksonville was proposed to foot the bill for two-thirds of the cost of stadium improvements in the original term sheet.\n\nThe City Council will vet the proposal on an extraordinary 60-day cycle, with Council auditors and members digging into the deal while the Mayor sells it around town.\n\nLegislative approval is not a sure thing.\n\nThe Council offered a surprise when the Jaguars wanted money for an entertainment district in the so-called Lot J deal. A 12-7 vote fell one shy of the necessary 2/3 supermajority, and former Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry and Jaguars owner Shad Khan took a shocking loss unimaginable for that Mayor and that franchise in previous tries.\n\nThe proposed entertainment zone at the Sports Complex would have come with a hefty city obligation, with upwards of $245 million on the project.\n\nIn previous recent years, Jacksonville taxpayers authorized $88 million of city-funded capital improvements to the Jaguars' stadium: $43 million for the world's biggest scoreboard during the Alvin Brown administration, and under the Curry administration, half of a $90 million buy-in that secured a new amphitheater, a covered practice field, and club seat improvements.", "source": {"uri": "floridapolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections.

The total cost is expected to reach $1.4 billion.\n\nThe Jacksonville Florida Times-Union reported City Council chair Ron Salem saying,\n\n\"The mayor reached out to me late yesterday afternoon to inform me that the executive branch and the Jaguars have reached an agreement on the stadium renovation.\"\n\nA statement released clarified,\n\n\"We have reached an agreement on the framework of a deal. The negotiating team is currently putting the final details on paper, and we will release that information as soon as it is available.\"\n\nSalem did not divulge the ratio of the cost-sharing for the mooted amount. Giving a timeframe for June, he added,\n\n\"I do not know the specifics of this particular deal but look forward to engaging the council during the month of June as we move forward to review it.\"\n\nJaguars would need Jacksnville's decision preferably before October\n\nWhile the mayor and the city council will now move ahead with their process, some confirmation is ideally needed by summer. Since the NFL owners are meeting in October, having a deal done before that will be ideal.\n\nThe Jaguars were formed in 1995 and have always played at the EverBank Stadium. Their current lease goes until 2029. A future 30-year lease deal with the city is reported to be part of the renovations agreement.\n\nThe work is expected to take place in 2025 and 2026. The capacity is scheduled to decrease to 62,000 after all the work is done from its present seating of more than 67,000. For college games, it is reportedly expandable up to 71,500.\n\nIt is in the interest of the city to also agree to a deal because Jacksonville is the smallest market in the NFL outside Green Bay. But the Packers also capture the Milwaukee market and are the only team in Wisconsin.\n\nFlorida has three teams: the Miami Dolphins, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Jaguars.

A proposal the Jaguars unveiled last year showed the city potentially paying nearly $1 billion, although that figure was based on additional development around the stadium that city officials said won't be a part of the agreement they present to the council for stadium renovations.\n\nDeegan's administration had not as of Wednesday morning responded to a public-records request for copies of the agreement, saying instead in a statement that negotiators were \"currently putting the final details on paper.\" She and Jaguars President Mark Lamping plan to present the terms to the council on Tuesday.\n\nThe deal, no matter its innerworkings, is likely to pass given the sheer stakes and the potent professional lobbying force behind the Jaguars and owner Shad Khan, a prolific political donor.\n\nAlready, there was a sense of exhilaration about the announcement of a deal and the renewed lease on life the Jaguars will have in Jacksonville as a result. But when the pomp fades away Deegan will confront an issue of enormous complexity and unprecedented scope that is unlike any a modern Jacksonville mayor has faced. Public subsidies for professional sports teams have grown ever larger but come under renewed scrutiny in recent years by economists and voters, and a portion of Deegan's own base of support is skeptical of spending large sums on the stadium. \"How can the city invest billions of dollars on a football stadium most residents can't afford to enjoy or a new jail where too many will be held unnecessarily and too many will die, when the promises of consolidation over 55 years ago have STILL not been fulfilled,\" asked Kelly Frazier, president of the Northside Coalition of Jacksonville, a well-known activist group.\n\nThe day-to-day reality of paying for that stadium will also weigh heavily on City Hall finances.\n\nThe free flow of pandemic-era federal money has ended, borrowing costs are remarkably high, and Jacksonville officials are staring down a number of other expensive priorities.\n\nJacksonville Sheriff T.K. Waters and his supporters on the council are planning to move forward on building a new jail, a project that could also cost nearly $1 billion. The city is locked in negotiations with the unions representing police officers and firefighters over pay and benefits that could result in costly contracts with a recurring punch to the budget. City Hall is also shelling out tens of millions to jumpstart growth in Jacksonville's stagnant downtown. And Deegan has pledged to move the needle on entrenched problems like resiliency and correcting decades of inequitable investment in some Jacksonville neighborhoods -- billion-dollar campaigns in their own right.\n\nThe mayor has invested her interest in the \"community benefits agreement\" -- a portion of the overall deal that will call for the Jaguars to invest millions back into the city over the life of their renewed lease, a potential boon for the neighborhood surrounding the sports and entertainment district. But the details on that, as with the rest of the deal, remain unknown.\n\nDeegan has resisted the framing that a stadium deal will define her first term, much less her second as well, were she to win re-election, but the work won't end when everyone has signed on the dotted line. This agreement and its tangible real-world impacts will live with her administration as long as she's in office. No major projects go exactly as planned, and few require no unexpected change orders (read: more money). The city will continue to rack up its own expensive needs: issues Deegan cares about, like inequality and climate change, aren't going anywhere. Money is always needed, and money is finite.\n\nAnd all along the way Deegan will own this project, for better or worse.", "source": {"uri": "eu.jacksonville.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Treasure Coast Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "florida_times_union@eu.jacksonville.com", "name": "Florida Times-Union", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Deegan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donna Deegan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Deegan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gary Deegan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverBank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EverBank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salem, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salem, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monroe, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Monroe, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lamping", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Lamping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shahid_Khan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shahid Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_City_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia City Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Urban_and_Regional_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Urban and Regional Planning", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/08/NFTU/73614847007-jki-071823-jaguars-performa.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5471,3079,x0,y284&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550709", "eventUri": "eng-9550709", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

It's certainly a common tactic to wait until the last possible moment to announce stadium subsidy plans, lest people start looking at them and thinking about them and all the other nasty things people are wont to do. But not even releasing them until the council is actually gathered to discuss it is above and beyond the usual hurry-up-and-wait, and resulted in this hilarious back and forth between Deegan and a reporter for Action News Jax:\n\nWe asked why the city announced a deal had been reached if it wasn't willing to provide details for days.\n\n\"Did you hear me make an announcement?\" said Deegan in response.\n\nWe noted the release sent by the city.\n\n\"After the news came out. Look I will be talking to you on Tuesday,\" Deegan responded.\n\n\"Did you hear me make an announcement?\" while at a press conference you yourself called is truly peak elected official, A+, no notes.\n\nOne hopes that some of the stadium details will leak before Tuesday, or at least that some of the council members will get tipped off in advance so they can ask more probing questions than \"Hold up, what page are we on?\" At last report, Khan was still asking for close to $1 billion in public money, all to upgrade a stadium that has already been renovated three times in the last 28 years -- and that's presumably before any hidden goodies like tax breaks or infrastructure.

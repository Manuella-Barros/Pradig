Nigerian government, to demonstrate its commitment under the leadership of President Bola Tinubu, has approved a $100 million investment from four agencies of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, exceeding the minimum equity requirement of $83.33 million for Class A shares.\n\nAPPO decided to award the hosting rights to Nigeria at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of Ministers.\n\nThe decision, lauded as a significant step for the continent's energy sector, underscores Nigeria's pivotal role in Africa's energy landscape.\n\nMinister of State Petroleum Resources (Oil), Heineken Lokpobiri, who made this known in Abuja on Thursday, also expressed his gratitude for the support extended by President Tinubu in Nigeria's bid to host the Bank.\n\nHe similarly extended appreciation to the council for their confidence in Nigeria's capability, \"This decision reflects our collective ambition to create African solutions to African energy challenges.\n\n\"The African Energy Bank

emphasised that this initiative aligns with the broader objectives of the African Union's Agenda 2063, aiming for a prosperous and self-sustaining Africa.\n\nLokpobiri highlighted the collaborative spirit of the APPO members and their shared vision for a united, energy-secured Africa, reiterating his gratitude to Tinubu for his unwavering support and to the Council of Ministers for their trust in Nigeria's ability to lead this pivotal initiative.\n\nThis strategic move positions Nigeria favorably to win the bid, potentially reshaping the country's oil and gas ecosystem.\n\nThe AEB, when headquartered in Nigeria, is expected to become the largest single foreign direct investment inflow into the country in over two decades.\n\nThe establishment of the AEB in Nigeria is anticipated to significantly boost the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), employment, financial architecture, and economic diversification, while supporting foreign exchange management strategies.\n\nThe $5

(APPO), places Nigeria at the forefront of Africa's energy future, Minister of State Petroleum Resources Heineken Lokpobiri, said in a statement.\n\nNigeria's bid to host the AEB was strengthened in late May after it ratified the bank's charter and President Bola Tinubu approved a $100-million investment to the bank, greater than the required $83.33-million for member states.\n\nThe fossil fuel-focused bank, a partnership between Afrexim Bank and APPO, aims to fund energy projects on the continent and support its energy transition goals.\n\n\"This decision reflects our collective ambition to create African solutions to African energy challenges,\" Lokpobiri said.\n\n\"The African Energy Bank will be instrumental in providing the necessary financial backbone for energy projects that will drive growth and development across the continent,\" he added.\n\nThe AEB initially has $5-billion to spend when it takes off later this year.\n\nAnalysts said that Nigeria, as a founding member of APPO and Africa's top energy producers, has shown strong interest in the bank as the country makes a new push for investment into its lagging oil and gas industry.\n\n\"Hosting the bank would be a vote of confidence in Nigeria at a time its energy industry badly needs a boost,\" Clementine Wallop, director for sub-Saharan Africa at political risk consultancy Horizon Engage, said

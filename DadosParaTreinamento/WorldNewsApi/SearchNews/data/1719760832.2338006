For Calvin Klein's \"This Is Love\" campaign, launching May 29, the model and actress, 31, strips down to the brand's iconic underwear. She has her tattoos on full display and her hair in a wet-look style. No stranger to striking a pose, she hits them all with ease in a number of photos and videos, including in an exclusive behind-the-scenes video shared exclusively with PEOPLE. In another exclusive video, Delevingne candidly opens up about love, in honor of Pride Month. \"Love, to me, encapsulates everything about life: the good, the bad, the ugly, the beautiful, the magnificent. Just the highs and the lows, I guess,\" she says. \"It teaches you about yourself. And I think, what I didn\u2019t have, at least, is younger people today are so much more who they are and they\u2019re not going to change for anyone whereas I felt like I was always so scared or like I didn\u2019t want to be who I really was. There is so much more freedom to be who you want to be, of course there are still struggles and there is still so much to fight against but I get so inspired by people in the queer community.\" The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

Delevingne, a style chameleon who looks at home on a red carpet just as much as she does in casual street style, also opened up about how her style has evolved as she's gotten older \u2014 especially in relation to her identity. The American Horror Story star reveals that she finds clothing \"so funny\" because when she was younger, she viewed clothes more as a \"costume\" to try to make her feel \"different.\" Now, however, she sees them as a \"tool\" to express herself instead of using her voice. \"There\u2019s such a clever way about using clothing as a statement,\" she continues. \"My personal style is: I don\u2019t really care, slash I do really care, slash whatever I feel that day.\" Actor Jeremy Pope also stars in the \"This Is Love\" campaign alongside Delevingne, and the two dance and lip-sync to Crystal Waters\u2019 song \u201c100% Pure Love\u201d in yet another campaign video. Models and dancers Stella Maxwell, Greta Hofer, Tinglei Liu, Monet Lauren, Charlie Knepper, Vinson Fraley, Janick Heilijgers, Diego Pasillas and Mauro van de Kerkhof round out the cast for the Pride campaign. Throughout, everyone wears Calvin Klein's latest underwear designs: the iconic silhouettes with rainbow detailing. The logos have gotten a colorful makeover and feature a gradient detail on the waistbands and monograms. Calvin Klein also designed two limited-edition T-shirts in partnership with its NGOs, Transgender Law Center and ILGA World. The new collection will be available online and in stores while supplies last.", "summary": "Delevingne stars in Calvin Klein&#39;s &#39;This Is Love&#39; ads \u2014 and PEOPLE has your exclusive look behind the scenes", "url": "https://people.com/cara-delevingne-calvin-klein-pride-campaign-exclusive-8654208", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/Ch0HBa2n7NeLVfEWocW4jSYmN64=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Cara-Delevingne-Calvin-Klein-Campaign6-05282024-e5ece926a54e4f33abcdb60b7e1a37ba.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:06:08", "author": "Hedy Phillips", "authors": ["Hedy Phillips"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.394}

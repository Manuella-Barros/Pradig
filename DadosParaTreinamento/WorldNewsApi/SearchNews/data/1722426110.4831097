President Biden fumbled lines and lost his train of thought on the debate stage, sparking Democratic soul-searching about his ability to beat Mr. Trump in November. \u201cDid anybody last night watch a thing called the debate? That was a big one,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a rally in Chesapeake, Virginia, where he\u2019s working to flip the state into the GOP column in November. \u201cWe had a big victory against a man that is looking to destroy our country.\u201d Mr. Trump said Mr. Biden spent the whole week at Camp David only to fumble the ball. \u201cHe studied very hard. He studied so hard that he didn\u2019t know what the hell he was doing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cNo amount of rest or rigging could help him defend his atrocious record.\u201d The Trump campaign wants to expand the 2024 map by winning Virginia and its 13 electoral votes. Each party has grabbed control of the legislature and governor\u2019s mansion in Richmond in recent years, making Virginia a potential swing state, though it has tended Democrat in the last four presidential elections. Chris LaCivita, a senior advisor to Mr. Trump, told reporters the campaign has a variety of paths to victory. \u201cVirginia is in play, Minnesota is in play and now we are seeing that New Mexico is coming online,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are actually expanding the map and, look, the Biden campaign is actually decreasing the size of the map.\u201d Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, won in 2021, and the Trump team wants to press the GOP\u2019s advantage in the Old Dominion. \u201cThis is about strength versus weakness,\u201d Mr. Youngkin said in warm-up speeches for Mr. Trump. \u201cWe have seen the weak American that Joe Biden has created.\u201d Mr. Trump echoed those sentiments when he took the stage. \u201cThe election is a choice between strength and weakness, competence and incompetence,\u201d Mr. Trump said. Other parts of his speech circled his usual campaign themes, including Mr. Biden\u2019s chaotic military exit from Afghanistan and the need to avoid another global conflict. \u201cWe have a man who is grossly incompetent heading up our nation,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cLast night was a defeat not only for Biden but for the entire radical left.\u201d The Democratic National Committee said Virginians won\u2019t buy what Mr. Trump and Mr. Youngkin are selling, pointing to the governor\u2019s embrace of a 15-week abortion ban last year. \u201cVirginians had different plans: On Election Day, Republicans suffered humiliating losses as Virginians sent Youngkin and Trump a clear message and delivered Democratic majorities to both legislative chambers,\u201d DNC spokeswoman Maddy Mundy said. Mr. Trump made the foray into Virginia as Democrats reeled from Mr. Biden\u2019s painful debate performance which only cemented voters\u2019 concerns that he\u2019s too old for the job. Mr. Biden, 81, often lost his train of thought, mumbled and struggled to deliver lines. It sent a shiver of panic through Democrat circles. After the debate, Mr. Biden insisted he \u201cdid well\u201d but said he had a sore throat. Democrats also complained about Mr. Trump\u2019s tendency to lie without pushback from moderators, such as downplaying the size of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol or stating Democrats support abortion \u201cafter birth\u201d even though infanticide is illegal in all states. Mr. Biden misstated facts, too, such as saying he put a $15 cap on insulin costs when it is $35. The president tried to bounce back with a more spirited performance during a rally Friday in Raleigh, North Carolina, where he vowed to beat Mr. Trump this fall. He also received support from senior Democrats and his former boss, President Barack Obama. \u201cBad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know,\u201d Mr. Obama said on X. \u201cBut this election is still a choice between someone who has fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself.\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris, speaking in Nevada on Friday, said that \u201ccharacter matters more than style\u201d and the election will not be decided by \u201cone night in June.\u201d But Mr. Trump twisted the knife, saying Democrats are better off with Mr. Biden than alternatives. He called California Gov. Gavin Newsom \u201cone of the worst governors\u201d and suggested that Ms. Harris is so low-performing that it offers the Democratic president some job protection. \u201cIt might have been Joe Biden\u2019s single best decision putting her as vice president,\u201d he said.", "summary": "Former President Donald Trump on Friday said the November election is a choice between \"competence and incompetence\" as he relished a big victory against President Biden in his first rally following the presidential debate in Atlanta.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/28/donald-trump-tells-virginia-rally-election-is-choi/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/25/Election_2024_Trump_91096.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:28:25", "author": "Seth McLaughlin", "authors": ["Seth McLaughlin"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.086}

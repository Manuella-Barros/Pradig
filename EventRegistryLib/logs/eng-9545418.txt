Against the Japanese yen, the dollar slowly inched up after it fell more than 3% last week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since early December 2022.\n\nThe dollar held tight ranges against most peers on Thursday as traders awaited key U.S. inflation data for cues on Federal Reserve policy, while the focus on the massive interest rate gap between Japan and the U.S. helped it make some gains on the yen.\n\nAgainst the Japanese yen, the dollar slowly inched up after it fell more than 3% last week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since early December 2022. The yen received a slight boost in the Asian morning following the release of the Bank of Japan's summary of opinions from its April meeting, showing many board members saw the need to raise rates and eventually reduce the bank's bond purchases.\n\nThe move was brief, however, with the market decidedly bearish on the currency. Last week's Fed policy meeting and downside surprise in U.S. job growth have markets increasing bets for two rate cuts this year. But a chasm remains between Japan's ultra-low yields and those in the United States.\n\n\"The market is not really worried about the sudden turn by the Fed. So in this sense, the market is biased for the upside for dollar/yen,\" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities. Traders remain wary of possible currency intervention by Tokyo, potentially triggering some sharp, \"nervous moves\" as the greenback edges higher, he added, likely keeping dollar/yen locked in the 155-160 range.\n\nJapan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda on Thursday reiterated a warning that Tokyo is ready to take action in the currency market. Focus swings to the April U.S. producer price index (PPI) and the consumer price index (CPI) out next week, which markets will watch for signs that inflation has resumed its downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target rate.\n\nFed Bank of Boston President Susan Collins said overnight that the U.S. economy needs to cool to return inflation back to target.

In Europe, the Swedish crown came under pressure after the central bank cut interest rates and said it expected two more cuts this year, while the pound was stuck in negative territory ahead of a Bank of England meeting the next day.\n\nThe yen remained front of mind for currency traders, weakening for a third day and prompting Japanese officials to issue a stronger warning over the impact of the weak currency on the economy. Traders believe Japanese authorities spent some $60 billion last week on propping up the yen after it hit its weakest in 34-years against the dollar around 160 yen.\n\nAnalysts have said any intervention from Tokyo would only offer temporary respite for the yen, given the wide gap between interest rates in the U.S. and Japan. \"If we were to see a sudden, sharp move up in dollar/yen then I would expect them to step into the market to support the yen.

FED CONQUERS ALL\n\nInvestors are focussed on the pace and timing of Fed rate cuts that will likely drive the currency market. The latest data showing weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs creation, together with an easing bias from the U.S. central bank, have cemented expectations that rates will likely be lower by year-end. The dollar was last up 0.1% at 105.48 against a basket of currencies, above last week's one-month low.\n\nIn the meantime, central banks in Europe have already started cutting interest rates. The Swiss National Bank cut in March ahead of Wednesday's move by Sweden's Riksbank. The European Central Bank has signalled its intention to cut in June, assuming the data points in the right direction, and the BoE is gradually smoothing the way to its first cut.\n\n\"What we're looking at is a raft of European central banks going over the next few months, whether or not it's June, or August. We've got a near 50% chance of the Fed cutting in September, but I think that's probably the one that could get pushed out,\" XTB research director Kathleen Brooks said. \"For now, and particularly today, the focus is on Europe cutting first and we're seeing that upward pressure on the dollar,\" she said.\n\nThe euro was steady at $1.0752. Against the Swedish crown, the euro rose 0.2% to 11.709 crowns. Sterling was down 0.1% at $1.24995.\n\nIn cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was down 0.8% at $62,450, set for a fourth daily loss, its longest stretch of daily declines so far this year.

The latest data showing weaker-than-expected US jobs creation, together with an easing bias from the US central bank, have cemented expectations that rates will likely be lower by year-end.\n\nThe dollar was last up 0.1 per cent at 105.48 against a basket of currencies, above last week's one-month low.\n\nIn the meantime, central banks in Europe have already started cutting interest rates. The Swiss National Bank cut in March ahead of Wednesday's move by Sweden's Riksbank.\n\nThe European Central Bank has signalled its intention to cut in June, assuming the data points in the right direction, and the BOE is gradually smoothing the way to its first cut.\n\n\"What we're looking at is a raft of European central banks going over the next few months, whether or not it's June, or August. We've got a near 50 per cent chance of the Fed cutting in September, but I think that's probably the one that could get pushed out,\" XTB research director Kathleen Brooks said.\n\n\"For now, and particularly today, the focus is on Europe cutting first and we're seeing that upward pressure on the dollar,\" she said.\n\nThe euro was steady at US$1.0752. Against the Swedish krona, the euro rose 0.2 per cent to 11.709 kronor.\n\nSterling was down 0.1 per cent at US$1.24995.\n\nIn cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin was down 0.8 per cent at US$62,450, set for a fourth daily loss, its longest stretch of daily declines so far this year.

The RBA hopes the economy won't have to face additional rate hikes, Bullock added.\n\nThe Australian dollar was last down 0.3% at $0.6603, retreating from Friday's high of $0.6650, a level previously seen on March 8.\n\n\"It was a bit of 'buy the rumour and sell the fact,'\" said James Kniveton, senior corporate FX dealer at Convera.\n\n\"They (the RBA) remain vigilant to upside risk, but the hawkish bias the markets expected has not eventuated.\"\n\nThe euro was little changed at $1.0767 and sterling fell 0.2% to $1.2540 before the Bank of England's policy announcement on Thursday, where interest rates are likely to be kept unchanged.\n\n($1=154.2000 yen)\n\n(Reporting by Samuel Indyk and Kevin Buckland;

The latest data showing weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs creation, together with an easing bias from the U.S. central bank, have cemented expectations that rates will likely be lower by year-end.\n\nThe dollar was last up 0.1% at 105.53 against a basket of currencies, above last week's one-month low.\n\nIn the meantime, central banks in Europe have already started cutting interest rates. The Swiss National Bank cut in March ahead of Wednesday's move by Sweden's Riksbank.\n\nThe European Central Bank has signaled its intention to cut in June, assuming the data points in the right direction, and the BoE is gradually smoothing the way to its first cut.\n\n\"What we're looking at is a raft of European central banks going over the next few months, whether or not it's June, or August. We've got a near 50% chance of the Fed cutting in September, but I think that's probably the one that could get pushed out,\" XTB research director Kathleen Brooks said.\n\n\"For now, and particularly today, the focus is on Europe cutting first and we're seeing that upward pressure on the dollar,\" she said.\n\nWhile traders are pricing in an expected Fed rate cut in September, that move will also depend on whether inflation continues to ease back closer to the U.S. central bank's 2% target.\n\n\"It's going to be hard to go more dovish from here in terms of Fed expectations I think in the near term and that's why that bias to buy the dollar is still going to be in place,\" said UBS' Serebriakov.\n\nThe euro was down 0.02% at $1.075.\n\nSterling weakened 0.22% to $1.2475.\n\nIn

Against the Japanese yen, the dollar has been slowly inching up in recent days after it fell more than 3% last week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since early December 2022.\n\nBut the yen found some support in the BOJ's summary of opinions released on Thursday, which showed board members were overwhelmingly hawkish at their April policy meeting with many calling for steady interest rates hikes. The \"BOJ appears to be hinting at the next rate hike, which could come in June or July as final results of wage negotiations come out,\" said Charu Chanana, head of currency strategy at Saxo.\n\nThe yen's pop higher was brief, however, with the market decidedly bearish on the currency. Last week's Fed policy meeting and downside surprise in U.S. job growth have markets increasing bets for two rate cuts this year. But a chasm remains between Japan's ultra-low yields and those in the United States.\n\n\"The market is not really worried about the sudden turn by the Fed. So in this sense, the market is biased for the upside for dollar/yen,\" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities. With traders still wary of possible currency intervention by Tokyo, however, dollar/yen will likely stay locked in the 155-160 range, he added.\n\nMarket players suspect Tokyo spent some $60 billion last week to stem the yen's slide after it hit its weakest in 34-years against the dollar around 160 yen. Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda on Thursday reiterated a warning that Tokyo is ready to take action in the currency market.\n\nThe Japanese yen was mostly flat at 155.57 per greenback. RATE PATHS IN FOCUS\n\nMarket focus will soon swing to the April U.S. producer price index (PPI) and the consumer price index (CPI) out next week, which traders will watch for signs that inflation has resumed its downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target rate. \"This is a make-or-break report for the Fed, as another print questioning the disinflation narrative can put their credibility at risk,\" Saxo's Chanana said.\n\nFed Bank of Boston President Susan Collins said overnight that the U.S. economy needs to cool to return inflation back to target. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was unchanged at 105.51.\n\nSterling was steady at $1.24975 ahead of the Bank of England's policy decision later on Thursday. The BOE is likely to take another step towards its first interest rate cut in four years as inflation falls.\n\nThe big question for investors is whether the BOE suggests that a cut could come in June - when the European Central Bank has already signalled it will reduce borrowing costs. The euro held at $1.0748.\n\nElsewhere, China's offshore yuan was marginally higher at 7.2257, after data revealed China's exports and imports returned to growth in April after contracting in the previous month. That could mean a potential delay for rate cuts some believed China would need to make to meet its 2024 GDP goal.\n\nIn cryptocurrencies, bitcoin last rose 0.09% to $61,618.12.\n\n(This story has not

The carry trade remains a draw, with a Federal Reserve rate cut likely to take some time and the Bank of Japan taking a cautious approach to tightening after its first rate hike since 2007 in March, leaving a vast gap of 360 basis points between ultra-low Japanese long-term yields and their U.S. counterparts .\n\nThe U.S. dollar inched higher on Tuesday while the yen slipped as wide interest rate differentials weighed, despite fresh warnings from Japanese officials following two rounds of suspected dollar-selling intervention last week. The Australian dollar fell from a near two-month high against its U.S. counterpart after the Reserve Bank of Australia refrained from ramping up hawkish signals, as some traders had anticipated.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index - which measures the currency against six major peers, including the yen, sterling and euro - was up 0.1% at 105.23, after dipping as low as 104.52 on Friday. The index is up nearly 4% this year but fell almost 1% last week after the Federal Reserve ruled out further rate hikes and there were signs of a softening U.S. labour market.\n\n\"Overall we're still more structurally positive on U.S. macro as a whole and think that is what is going to support the dollar in the coming year,\" said Kirstine Kundby-Nielsen, FX analyst at Danske Bank. The U.S. dollar was last up 0.4% at 154.51 yen, adding to its 0.6% gain on Monday.\n\nOn Friday, it sank as low as 151.86 yen for the first time since April 10, as the soft U.S. jobs data fed losses following Bank of Japan data that suggested official intervention could have amounted to some 9 trillion yen ($58 billion). Japan's finance ministry has refrained from commenting on whether it was behind the dollar selling, but top currency diplomat Masato Kanda repeated on Tuesday that the government \"will continue to take the same firm approach\" to disorderly yen moves.\n\nHe also acknowledged that an orderly market would not require the government to step in. \"Kanda noted that there was no need to intervene when markets are functioning properly, implying that they have not been functioning properly of late,\" said Colin Asher, senior economist at Mizuho.\n\nThe carry trade remains a draw, with a Federal Reserve rate cut likely to take some time and the Bank of Japan taking a cautious approach to tightening after its first rate hike since 2007 in March, leaving a vast gap of 360 basis points between ultra-low Japanese long-term yields and their U.S. counterparts . At the same time, DBS analysts estimate that even after last week's bounce, the yen is still the most undervalued currency in the G10 grouping, while the dollar remains \"highly overvalued\".\n\n\"We expect Japan to continue leaning against excessive JPY weakness,\" they wrote in a client note. The Aussie fell after the RBA's rate decision, where rates were kept unchanged, but the central bank stopped short of reinstating a tightening bias that some had expected as inflation failed to cool by as much as forecast.\n\nIn her press conference after the central bank's widely expected decision, governor Michele Bullock said the board believes monetary policy is at the right level to return inflation to target. The RBA hopes the economy won't have to face additional rate hikes, Bullock added. The Australian dollar was last down 0.3% at $0.6603, retreating from Friday's high of $0.6650, a level previously seen on March 8.\n\n\"It was a bit of 'buy the rumour and sell the fact,'\" said James Kniveton, senior corporate FX dealer at Convera. \"They (the RBA) remain vigilant to upside risk, but the hawkish bias the markets expected has not eventuated.\"\n\nThe euro was little changed at $1.0767 and sterling fell 0.2% to $1.2540 before the Bank of England's policy announcement on Thursday, where interest rates are likely to be kept unchanged.

But a chasm remains between Japan's ultra-low yields and those in the United States.\n\n\"The market is not really worried about the sudden turn by the Fed. So in this sense, the market is biased for the upside for dollar/yen,\" said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities.\n\nWith traders still wary of possible currency intervention by Tokyo, however, dollar/yen will likely stay locked in the 155-160 range, he added.\n\nMarket players suspect Tokyo spent some $60 billion last week to stem the yen's slide after it hit its weakest in 34-years against the dollar around 160 yen.\n\nJapan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda on Thursday reiterated a warning that Tokyo is ready to take action in the currency market.\n\nThe Japanese yen was mostly flat at 155.57 per greenback.\n\nRATE PATHS IN FOCUS\n\nMarket focus will soon swing to the April U.S. producer price index (PPI) and the consumer price index (CPI) out next week, which traders will watch for signs that inflation has resumed its downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target rate.\n\n\"This is a make-or-break report for the Fed, as another print questioning the disinflation narrative can put their credibility at risk,\" Saxo's Chanana said.\n\nFed Bank of Boston President Susan Collins said overnight that the U.S. economy needs to cool to return inflation back to target.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was unchanged at 105.51.\n\nSterling was steady at $1.24975 ahead of the Bank of England's policy decision later on Thursday.\n\nThe BOE is likely to take another step towards its first interest rate cut in four years as inflation falls.\n\nThe big question for investors is whether the BOE suggests that a cut could come in June - when the European Central Bank has already signalled it will reduce borrowing costs.\n\nThe euro held at $1.0748.\n\nElsewhere, China's offshore yuan was marginally higher at 7.2257, after data revealed China's exports and imports returned to growth in April after contracting in the previous month.\n\nThat could mean a potential delay for rate cuts some believed China would need to make to meet its 2024 GDP goal.\n\nIn cryptocurrencies, bitcoin last rose 0.09% to $61,618.12.\n\n(Reporting by Brigid Riley; Editing by Sam Holmes and Shri Navaratnam)", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The yen was 0.23% lower on the day at 155.93 per dollar, with the Japanese currency briefly finding some support in the BOJ's summary of opinions released on Thursday, which showed board members were overwhelmingly hawkish at their April policy meeting, with many calling for steady interest rates hikes.\n\nThe pound slipped on Thursday after the Bank of England (BoE) held its benchmark interest rates at 5.25%, while hawkish opinions from Bank of Japan (BOJ) members helped slow the yen's fall. The dollar index rose as traders start to focus on U.S. inflation data due next week and its implications for Federal Reserve policy.\n\nSterling fell 0.3% to $1.2462, moving away from a three-week high of $1.2709 touched last week. The BoE held rates but a second official in the Monetary Policy Committee backed a cut and Governor Andrew Bailey said he was \"optimistic that things are moving in the right direction\". BoE officials voted 7-2 to keep rates at a 16-year high. Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden joined Swati Dhingra in voting for a cut to 5%.\n\nAccording to LSEG data, money markets had almost fully priced in that the central bank would keep rates unchanged. But investors have been watching for signs to firm their expectations on when cuts could come. They now expects a first cut in August, with the odds of such a move coming in June down to a 44% chance, compared to a 55% chance seen earlier in the day.\n\n\"Today's decision to maintain the base rate at 5.25% came as no surprise to the markets, yet the certainty of a summer rate cut remains in question,\" said Colleen McHugh, Chief Investment Officer of Wealthify. Elsewhere, against the Japanese yen, the dollar has been slowly inching up after it fell 3.4% last week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since early December 2022.\n\nThe yen was 0.23% lower on the day at 155.93 per dollar, with the Japanese currency briefly finding some support in the BOJ's summary of opinions released on Thursday, which showed board members were overwhelmingly hawkish at their April policy meeting, with many calling for steady interest rates hikes. The \"BOJ appears to be hinting at the next rate hike, which could come in June or July as final results of wage negotiations come out,\" said Charu Chanana, head of currency strategy at Saxo.\n\nIn the U.S., last week's Fed policy meeting and downside surprise in U.S. job growth have markets increasing bets for two rate cuts this year. But a chasm remains between Japan's ultra-low yields and those in the United States. Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda on Thursday reiterated a warning that Tokyo is ready to take action in the currency market.\n\nMarket players suspect Tokyo spent some $60 billion last week to stem the yen's slide after it hit its weakest in 34-years against the dollar around 160 yen. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, rose 0.17% to 105.70, having touched a one-week high earlier.\n\nTraders will be closely watching April U.S. producer price index (PPI) and the consumer price index (CPI) out next week for signs that inflation has resumed its downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target rate. China's offshore yuan was about flat on the day at 7.2335, as data revealed China's exports and imports returned to growth in April after contracting in the previous month.\n\nThat could mean a potential delay for rate cuts some believed China would need to make to meet its 2024 GDP goal.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

We will continue to take the same firm approach as we have in the past.\"\n\nTokyo is suspected to have intervened on at least two separate days last week to support the yen after it tumbled to lows last seen more than three decades ago.\n\nBank of Japan data suggested authorities spent more than 9 trillion yen ($58.4 billion) in defense of the currency, helping lift the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nTokyo is estimated to have spent around $60 billion during its last forays in the market to prop up the yen in September and October 2022.\n\nThe yen JPY=EBS, which is down nearly 9% on the dollar this year, was last trading around 154.26 in the late Asian afternoon.\n\nJapan is reluctant to intervene in the currency market considering its limited available dollar cash reserves and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's comments that such moves were acceptable only in rare circumstances, said Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.\n\n\"Kanda might have started a verbal warning early on, as he wants to fix the exchange rate pegged at around the lower 150 yen level against the dollar at least until around May 15\" when the U.S. consumer price index data comes out, Kumano said.\n\nKanda, the top Japanese currency diplomat, said it is normal practice for a currency authority to not comment on whether it has carried out market intervention, when asked about recent speculations that Japan has conducted yen-buying interventions.\n\nA weaker yen is a boon for Japanese exporters, but a headache for policymakers as it increases import costs, adds to inflationary pressures and squeezes households.\n\nSome businesses are even questioning whether the weak yen has become too much of a good thing.\n\n\"No matter what, the yen weaker than the 150 level (against the U.S. dollar) is too much,\" the chairman of the powerful Keidanren business lobby, Masakazu Tokura, told a regular press conference on Tuesday. He added that speculative-induced fluctuations in currencies were undesirable.\n\nIf authorities had conducted intervention, \"the time was very good,\" Tokura said.\n\nThe yen has been under pressure despite the BOJ's landmark decision to ditch negative interest rates in March as U.S. rates have climbed and Japan's have stayed near zero.\n\nThat dynamic has driven cash out of yen and into higher-yielding assets, with the pressure intensifying in recent months as expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts receded.\n\nKanda noted that a number of countries in addition to Japan had expressed serious concerns about foreign exchange market volatility in a meeting leading up to a ASEAN+3 finance ministers and central bank governors conference in the Georgian capital Tbilisi last week.\n\nASEAN+3 groups the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well as Japan, China and South Korea.\n\n\"The current concerns are not confined to Japan,\" Kanda said.",

Meanwhile, the significant interest rate differential between Japan and the US contributed to some gains against the yen.\n\nAgainst the yen, the dollar showed marginal improvement after experiencing a decline of over 3 per cent last week, its largest weekly drop since December 2022.\n\nThe yen briefly strengthened during the Asian session following the release of the Bank of Japan's summary of opinions from its April meeting, which highlighted the inclination of many board members towards rate hikes and eventual reduction of bond purchases. However, the market sentiment remains predominantly bearish on the currency.\n\nRecent developments, including the Fed's policy meeting last week and unexpected weakness in US job growth, have led to heightened expectations of two rate cuts this year. Nonetheless, a substantial gap persists between the ultra-low yields in Japan and those in the United States.\n\nMasafumi Yamamoto, Chief Currency Strategist at Mizuho Securities, noted, \"The market is not overly concerned about the Fed's sudden shift. Consequently, the prevailing bias leans towards the dollar gaining against the yen.\" He anticipates that potential currency intervention by Tokyo could trigger volatile movements as the dollar continues its ascent, likely confining dollar/yen within the 155-160 range.\n\nJapan's top currency diplomat, Masato Kanda, reiterated Tokyo's readiness to take action in the currency market, adding to market apprehensions.\n\nAttention now turns to the release of April's US Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) next week, which will provide insights into whether inflation is returning to the Fed's 2 per cent target rate.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston President Susan Collins highlighted the necessity for the US economy to cool down to bring inflation back to target.\n\nThe dollar index rose marginally to 105.55, while the yen remained mostly unchanged at 155.59 per dollar.\n\nSterling weakened slightly to $1.2487 ahead of the Bank of England's policy decision later in the day.

Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden joined Swati Dhingra in voting for a cut to 5%.\n\nSterling later steadied on the day at $1.2505, recovering losses after hitting a two-week low immediately after the BoE's policy decision.\n\nInvestors have been watching for signs to firm their expectations on when cuts could come.\n\n\"It's likely that we will need to cut bank rates over the coming quarters and make monetary policy somewhat less restrictive over the forecast period, possibly more so than currently priced into market rates,\" BoE Governor Andrew Bailey told journalists.\n\nHe added that more data will be available before a BoE decision for the June meeting is made.\n\nMoney markets see a 75% chance of a first cut in August, with the odds of such a move coming in June at a 45% chance.\n\n\"Sterling is recovering some of the fall made on the back of the BoE's policy statement,\" said Jane Foley, Head of FX Strategy at Rabobank.\n\n\"The dovish overtones will spark more optimism that the Bank may be ready to cut rates in June, though we expect that services sector inflation will result in a steady policy outcome until August\".\n\nElsewhere, the dollar has been slowly inching up against the Japanese yen after it fell 3.4% last week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since early December 2022.\n\nThe yen was flat on the day at 155.62 per dollar, with the Japanese currency briefly finding some support in the BOJ's summary of opinions released on Thursday. The summary showed board members were overwhelmingly hawkish at their April policy meeting, with many calling for steady interest rate hikes.\n\nThe \"BOJ appears to be hinting at the next rate hike, which could come in June or July as final results of wage negotiations come out,\" said Charu Chanana, head of currency strategy at Saxo.\n\nIn the U.S., last week's Fed policy meeting and weaker than forecast U.S. jobs growth have markets increasing bets for two rate cuts this year. But a chasm remains between Japan's ultra-low yields and those in the United States.\n\nJapan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda on Thursday reiterated a warning that Tokyo is ready to take action in the currency market.\n\nMarket players suspect Tokyo spent some $60 billion last week to stem the yen's slide after it hit its weakest in 34-years against the dollar around 160 yen.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, edged 0.04% lower to 105.46, having touched a one-week high earlier.\n\nTraders will be closely watching April U.S. producer price index (PPI) and the consumer price index (CPI) out next week for signs that inflation has resumed its downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target rate.\n\nChina's offshore yuan was about flat on the day at 7.2278, as data revealed China's exports and imports returned to growth in April after contracting in the previous month.\n\nThat could mean a potential delay for rate cuts some analysts believe China would need to make to meet its 2024 GDP goal.\n\n=\n\n(Reporting by Joice Alves and Brigid Riley; Editing by Philippa Fletcher, Chizu Nomiyama and Susan

We will continue to take the same firm approach as we have in the past,\" said Kanda.\n\nUeda also said the central bank will guide monetary policy with a close eye on how the yen's falls could affect inflation, suggesting the currency's moves could affect the pace and timing of future interest rate hikes.\n\n\"I mentioned that in general, currency moves could have a potentially major impact on the economy and prices, and that the BOJ will therefore scrutinise the yen's recent falls in guiding policy,\" Ueda told reporters after meeting premier Kishida.\n\nWhile a boon for Japanese exporters, the weak yen has become a source of headaches for policymakers as it increases import costs, adds to inflationary pressures and squeezes households.\n\nTokyo is suspected to have intervened on at least two separate days last week to support the yen after it tumbled to lows last seen more than three decades ago.\n\nBOJ data suggested authorities spent more than 9 trillion yen ($58.4 billion) in defence of the currency, helping lift the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nTokyo is estimated to have spent around $60 billion during its last forays in the market to prop up the yen in September and October 2022.\n\nThe yen, which is down nearly 9 per cent on the dollar this year, was last trading around 154.50.\n\nYIELD PRESSURE\n\nJapanese businesses have traditionally favoured a weak yen given the country's heavy reliance on exports. But they are now questioning whether the weak yen has become too much of a good thing.\n\n\"No matter what, the yen weaker than the 150 level (against the U.S. dollar) is too much,\" the chairman of the powerful Keidanren business lobby, Masakazu Tokura, told a regular press conference on Tuesday.

And individuals in Japan are a significant force in the foreign-exchange market, accounting for nearly 30% of global currency trading by retail investors, according to a BOJ report.\n\nIndividual investors \"felt that what they had been waiting for had finally arrived,\" said Takuya Kanda, head of research at Gaitame.com Research Institute.

We will continue to take the same firm approach as we have in the past.\n\nTokyo is suspected to have intervened on at least two separate days last week to support the yen after it tumbled to lows last seen more than three decades ago.\n\nBank of Japan data suggested authorities spent more than \u00a59 trillion ($58.4 billion) in defense of the currency, helping lift the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nTokyo is estimated to have spent around $60 billion during its last forays in the market to prop up the yen in September and October 2022.\n\nThe yen JPY=EBS, which is down nearly 9% on the dollar this year, was last trading around 154.50 in the early Asian afternoon.\n\nJapan is reluctant to intervene in the currency market considering its limited available dollar cash reserves and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's comments that such moves were acceptable only in rare circumstances, said Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.\n\nKanda might have started a verbal warning early on, as he wants to fix the exchange rate pegged at around the lower 150 yen level against the dollar at least until around May 15 when the U.S. consumer price index data comes out, Kumano said.\n\nKanda, the top Japanese currency diplomat, said it is normal practice for a currency authority to not comment on whether it has carried out market intervention, when asked about recent speculations that Japan has conducted yen-buying interventions.\n\nA weaker yen is a boon for Japanese exporters, but a headache for policymakers as it increases import costs, adds to inflationary pressures and squeezes households.\n\nThe yen has been under pressure despite the BOJ's landmark decision to ditch negative interest rates in March as U.S. rates have climbed and Japan's have stayed near zero.\n\nThat dynamic has driven cash out of yen and into higher-yielding assets, with the pressure intensifying in recent months as expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts receded.\n\nKanda noted that a number of countries in addition to Japan had expressed serious concerns about foreign exchange market volatility in a meeting leading up to a ASEAN+3 finance ministers and central bank governors conference in the Georgian capital Tbilisi last week.\n\nASEAN+3 groups the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well as Japan, China and South Korea.\n\nThe current concerns are not confined to Japan, Kanda said.", "source": {"uri":

The Japanese currency weakened despite Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda warning on the same day that \"a monetary policy response might be needed\" to the exchange-rate moves considering their significant impact on the economy and inflation.\n\nThe volume of dollar buying for yen by individual investors reached 27.3% of total transactions as of May 3, the largest this year on Click 365's exchange-traded FX margin market, according to Tokyo Financial Exchange Inc. data. The volume was especially heavy on April 29 and early on May 2 in Japan, when Japanese authorities are suspected to have conducted yen-buying interventions.\n\nThe fact that retail investors are using intervention as a chance to buy dollars cheap highlights the challenges Japanese officials face in trying to prevent a further tumble in the yen when a wide interest rate gap boosts the appeal of investing in US assets. And individuals in Japan are a significant force in the foreign-exchange market, accounting for nearly 30% of global currency trading by retail investors, according to a BOJ report.\n\nIndividual investors \"felt that what they had been waiting for had finally arrived,\" said Takuya Kanda, head of research at Gaitame.com Research Institute. After the interventions, \"I have the impression that those who bought dollars at around 152 yen have done the best,\" as the US currency has climbed from those levels, he said.\n\nJapanese individual investors may not stay dollar buyers for long, however, because the scope to profit against the yen may be decreasing.\n\nSince authorities are suspected to have conducted the second recent intervention around the 157-yen level, \"from the 155-yen level, investors will be looking for a place to sell, and as the yen approaches 157, the ratio may tilt toward selling dollars and buying yen in anticipation of intervention,\" said Kanda at Gaitame.com.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

That could mean a potential delay for rate cuts some believed China would need to make to meet its 2024 GDP goal.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ING_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ING Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Producer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_basket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency basket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Note", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Note"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_19_19_03_7965895.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545418", "eventUri": "eng-9545418", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

rate cuts", "body": "Investing.com-- Most Asian currencies weakened on Wednesday, while the dollar firmed as comments from Federal Reserve officials saw markets rethink expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts.\n\nThe Japanese yen remained an underperformer among its peers, weakening against the dollar even as government officials kept up their warnings of more potential intervention in currency markets.\n\nUnderperformance in the Australian dollar also persisted after the Reserve Bank of Australia struck a less hawkish chord than expected on Tuesday.\n\nJapanese yen weakens, USDJPY rises despite intervention threats\n\nThe Japanese yen's USDJPY pair- which is inversely representative of strength in the yen- rose 0.3% and past the 155 level, moving back towards 34-year highs of over 160 hit last week.\n\nThe pair had tumbled from those levels after the Japanese government seemingly intervened in currency markets on two separate occasions, while some weakness in the dollar also aided the yen.\n\nBut with markets now questioning the outlook for interest rate cuts in the U.S., traders resumed their speculation against the yen, even as Japanese officials warned against sustained weakness in the currency.\n\nAustralian dollar extends losses after less hawkish RBA\n\nThe Australian dollar's AUDUSD pair fell 0.4% on Wednesday, extending steep declines from the prior session after the RBA struck a less hawkish tone than traders were expecting.\n\nWhile the RBA held rates steady and warned that inflation will remain sticky in the coming months, it stopped short of threatening to hike rates further- a scenario that had been priced into the Aussie in the lead-up to the meeting.\n\nWhile the RBA did also imply that rates will remain high for longer, markets priced out expectations of rate hikes from the Australian dollar, which had hit a near two-month high before Tuesday's meeting.\n\nStill, losses in the Aussie are expected to be limited as interest rates remain near 12-year highs, potentially for the rest of 2024.\n\nDollar strengthens as Fed officials cool rate cut bets\n\nThe dollar index and dollar index futures rose 0.1% in Asian trade, extending overnight gains after a slew of Fed officials warned that U.S. rates were more likely to remain unchanged for the rest of the year.\n\nWhile softer-than-expected nonfarm payrolls data from last week spurred some bets on a September rate cut, a slew of Fed officials warned this week that sticky inflation was likely to give the bank more reason to keep rates static.\n\nThis rhetoric boosted the dollar and weighed on most risk-driven assets, with Asian currencies seeing sustained weakness.\n\nThe Chinese yuan's USDCNY pair rose 0.1%, with markets awaiting trade data for April, due on Thursday, for more cues on Asia's biggest economy.\n\nThe South Korean won's USDKRW pair jumped 0.5%, while the Singapore dollar's USDSGD pair added 0.1%.\n\nThe Indian rupee's USDINR pair remained in sight of record highs above 83.5, with the currency set to experience increased volatility amid the 2024 general elections.", "source": {"uri": "in.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

But investors will be watching for signs to firm their expectations on when cuts could come.\n\nMarkets now see a 55% chance of a BoE cut in June - when the European Central Bank has signalled it will reduce borrowing costs, and a greater chance, 72%, of a BoE rate cut in August.\n\n\"The big question is whether sterling should be priced closer to the Fed (and) dollar cycle or closer to the ECB (and)euro. It may be too early for the BoE to signal a June hike today, but we see downside risks to the pound,\" said Chris Turner, head of markets at ING.\n\nAgainst the Japanese yen, the dollar has been slowly inching up after it fell 3.4% last week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since early December 2022.\n\nThe yen was 0.2 lower on the day at 155.87 per dollar, with the Japanese currency briefly finding some support in the BOJ's summary of opinions released on Thursday, which showed board members were overwhelmingly hawkish at their April policy meeting, with many calling for steady interest rates hikes.\n\nThe \"BOJ appears to be hinting at the next rate hike, which could come in June or July as final results of wage negotiations come out,\" said Charu Chanana, head of currency strategy at Saxo.\n\nLast week's Fed policy meeting and downside surprise in U.S. job growth have markets increasing bets for two rate cuts this year.

This year, however, it may not have been the only reason why more than 3.1 million visitors - a one-month record, according to Japan's National Tourism Organisation - visited the Land of the Rising Sun.\n\nForeign tourists have been making the most of their harder currencies such as the euro and dollar to gain from an advantageous exchange rate with Japan's weaker currency.\n\nAlthough the fall in the yen is hurting Japanese households, visitors to Japan are benefiting from the exchange rate difference, according to the AFP press agency.\n\nAverage spending per person by foreign tourists was up by 52% between January and March this year, the agency reported, compared with the same period in 2019. That was the last year of comparison because of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nA 1,000-yen ramen cost \u20ac8 euros back then, compared with \u20ac5.8 euros at the start of the week. And a luxury watch costing 5,600 euros in 2019 is now worth \"only\" around \u20ac4,000. Tourists can also benefit from tax relief by presenting their passports.\n\nA weak yen is often seen as a boon for \"Japan Inc\" as it helps to make commercial exports, such as Nipon's car exports, cheaper abroad and boosts profits when income from abroad is brought home.\n\nHowever, at the same time, it raises the cost of raw materials, food and fuel, adversely affecting farmers who import fertilisers to small manufacturers who rely on spare parts from China.\n\nSmall businesses employ most of the workers in Japan, and cannot afford to pass on rising costs by raising their selling prices in a competitive market.\n\nEUR/JPY extended its losses for the third consecutive session, trading around 164.60 during Friday's European session. The Japanese yen (JPY) strengthened on Friday following a potential intervention by the Japanese government, marking the second such incident in a week, according to Reuters.\n\nOn 29 April, the currency plummeted against the dollar to 160.17 yen, a level last reached in 1990. It later recovered.\n\nOn 1 May, a sharp rise took the Japanese currency to 153.04 yen to the dollar although it later fell back slightly. Even so, by the close of dealing, the Japanese currency was still up 2.08% on the day, a big jump in a market where daily fluctuations are often limited to a few tenths of a percentage point.\n\nBank of Japan (BoJ) data has revealed that Japanese authorities may have spent around JPY3.66 trillion on 1 May in supporting the yen. Earlier in the week, the Japanese Ministry of Finance also intervened in the market, potentially investing around JPY 6,000 billion (\u20ac36 billion).\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Masato Kanda, Japan's top currency diplomat, declined to confirm the intervention directly but indicated that the Ministry of Finance intended to disclose related data by the end of the month.\n\nDespite the sharp fall in its currency, the Japanese central bank left its key rate unchanged at the end of April, keeping it between 0% and 0.1%, and maintaining a rather conciliatory tone.\n\nThis was an expected break after the BoJ began normalising its monetary policy in March, when it put an end to its negative interest rates, the most spectacular tool in its ultra-accommodative policy.", "source": {"uri":

rethink rate cuts By Investing.com", "body": "Investing.com-- Most Asian currencies weakened on Wednesday, while the dollar firmed as comments from Federal Reserve officials saw markets rethink expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts.\n\nThe Japanese yen remained an underperformer among its peers, weakening against the dollar even as government officials kept up their warnings of more potential intervention in currency markets.\n\nUnderperformance in the Australian dollar also persisted after the Reserve Bank of Australia struck a less hawkish chord than expected on Tuesday.\n\nThe Japanese yen's USDJPY pair- which is inversely representative of strength in the yen- rose 0.3% and past the 155 level, moving back towards 34-year highs of over 160 hit last week.\n\nThe pair had tumbled from those levels after the Japanese government seemingly intervened in currency markets on two separate occasions, while some weakness in the dollar also aided the yen.\n\nBut with markets now questioning the outlook for interest rate cuts in the U.S., traders resumed their speculation against the yen, even as Japanese officials warned against sustained weakness in the currency.\n\nThe Australian dollar's AUDUSD pair fell 0.4% on Wednesday, extending steep declines from the prior session after the RBA struck a less hawkish tone than traders were expecting.\n\nWhile the RBA held rates steady and warned that inflation will remain sticky in the coming months, it stopped short of threatening to hike rates further- a scenario that had been priced into the Aussie in the lead-up to the meeting.\n\nWhile the RBA did also imply that rates will remain high for longer, markets priced out expectations of rate hikes from the Australian dollar, which had hit a near two-month high before Tuesday's meeting.\n\nStill, losses in the Aussie are expected to be limited as interest rates remain near 12-year highs, potentially for the rest of 2024.\n\nThe dollar index and dollar index futures rose 0.1% in Asian trade, extending overnight gains after a slew of Fed officials warned that U.S. rates were more likely to remain unchanged for the rest of the year.\n\nWhile softer-than-expected nonfarm payrolls data from last week spurred some bets on a September rate cut, a slew of Fed officials warned this week that sticky inflation was likely to give the bank more reason to keep rates static.\n\nThis rhetoric boosted the dollar and weighed on most risk-driven assets, with Asian currencies seeing sustained weakness.\n\nThe Chinese yuan's USDCNY pair rose 0.1%, with markets awaiting trade data for April, due on Thursday, for more cues on Asia's biggest economy.\n\nThe South Korean won's USDKRW pair jumped 0.5%, while the Singapore dollar's USDSGD pair added 0.1%.\n\nThe Indian rupee's USDINR pair remained in sight of record highs above 83.5, with the currency set to experience increased volatility amid the 2024 general elections.", "source": {"uri":

Federal Reserve officials have kept the US benchmark federal funds rate in a range of 5.25-5.5%.\n\nThat's a major gap favouring investments in the US and therefore the dollar.\n\nThe gap is likely to stay intact longer than previously expected because the US economy's performance has been stronger than anticipated, and inflation has proved sticky.\n\nAs a result, expectations for rate cuts by the Fed have been pushed back.\n\nWhile the Fed delays rate cuts, Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda said he's likely to raise interest rates again if the underlying price trend improves.\n\nHe also said Japan's overall policy settings will remain accommodative, meaning he's unlikely to raise rates fast or by a lot.\n\nThat means any yen rebound is likely to be limited.\n\nGenerally, a weaker yen helps large Japanese companies with global operations because it increases the value of repatriated overseas profits. A weak currency can also help tourism by boosting the buying power of incoming travellers.\n\nJapan hosted a record number of tourists in March as the country saw an early start to the cherry blossom season.\n\nOn the downside, a soft yen makes imports of energy and food more expensive, hitting consumers. The nation's largest umbrella group of unions announced the largest wage hikes in three decades for the current fiscal year.\n\nThe first suspected currency intervention likely took place on May 29, after the yen hit 160 against the dollar for the first time since 1990. A sharp rebound in the yen followed later in the day, driving speculation that Japan had stepped back into markets to support its currency.\n\nThe second suspected intervention took place two days later, at the end of the US trading day, following the conclusion of the Fed's two-day meeting and in thin market liquidity.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has refrained from confirming interventions, but Bloomberg's analysis of BoJ accounts suggests interventions took place.\n\nLooking ahead, investors and economists are split over whether the BoJ is finished with raising interest rates this year or will make another move. Ueda has said if inflation runs hotter than expected, another rate hike would be on the table.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen acknowledged sharp moves in the value of the yen this week, even as she declined to say whether Japan had intervened to support the currency.\n\nJapan's foreign currency reserves were worth about $1.15tn at the end of March, climbing by $4.6bn from the previous month, according to the latest data from the country's Ministry of Finance.\n\nAbout $155bn was parked with the Bank for International Settlements and other foreign central banks, down slightly from $155.7bn at the end of February.\n\nWhile intervention is a clear way to tell speculators you won't allow the currency to go into free fall, it's only going to be a temporary fix unless economic fundamentals driving the trend are also addressed.\n\nIn addition, foreign reserves are generally there to protect the economy in the event of a major financial shock or unexpected event, not to artificially prop up the currency.", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki",

We will continue to take the same firm approach as we have in the past.\"\n\nTokyo is suspected to have intervened on at least two separate days last week to support the yen after it tumbled to lows last seen more than three decades ago.\n\nBank of Japan data suggested authorities spent more than 9 trillion yen ($58.4 billion) in defence of its currency, helping lift the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen was last trading around 154.27 in early Asia.\n\nJapan is reluctant to intervene in the currency market considering its limited available dollar cash reserves and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's comments that such moves were acceptable only in rare circumstances, said Hideo Kumano, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute.\n\n\"Kanda might have started a verbal warning early on, as he wants to fix the exchange rate pegged at around the lower 150 yen level against the dollar at least until around May 15\" when the U.S. consumer price index data comes out, Kumano said.\n\nKanda, the top Japanese currency diplomat, said it is normal practice for a currency authority to not comment on whether it has carried out market intervention, when asked about recent speculations that Japan has conducted yen-buying interventions.\n\nA weaker yen is a boon for Japanese exporters, but a headache for policymakers as it increases import costs, adds to inflationary pressures and squeezes households.\n\nKanda also noted that a number of countries in addition to Japan had expressed serious concerns about foreign exchange market volatility in a meeting leading up to a ASEAN+3 finance ministers and central bank governors conference in the Georgian capital Tbilisi last week.\n\nASEAN+3 groups the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as well as Japan, China and South Korea.\n\n\"The current concerns are not confined to Japan,\" Kanda said.\n\n($1

BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said it was possible the central bank would need to cut rates by more than investors expect.\n\nAgainst the Japanese yen the dollar edged 0.03% higher at 155.52 as hawkish opinions from Bank of Japan members helped slow the yen's fall. The dollar has been slowly recovering against the Japanese currency after it tumbled 3.4% last week, its biggest weekly percentage drop since early December 2022.\n\nThe yen had earlier strengthened to 155.15 per dollar, after the BOJ's summary of opinions showed board members were overwhelmingly hawkish at their April policy meeting, with many citing the need for steady interest rate hikes.\n\nBOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said the central bank will scrutinize the yen's recent declines in guiding monetary policy.\n\nMarket participants suspect Tokyo spent some $60 billion last week to stall the yen's slide after it hit its weakest level in 34-years against the dollar around 160 yen.\n\nIn a note on Thursday, Deutsche Bank's head of FX research, George Saravelos, reiterated that \"as long as the BOJ sees no urgency to rapidly normalize policy, the fundamental backdrop for the JPY (yen) will not change.\"\n\n(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak;

Data next week will include readings on consumer prices (CPI), producer prices (PPI) and retail sales.\n\n\"We did have a knee-jerk reaction in yields and the dollar lower this morning after the jobless claims number came in above expectations,\" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Corpay in Toronto.\n\nSchamotta said there were some seasonal distortions in the claims report that may have led to the higher reading, but he added that recent economic data \"kind of suggests that we're seeing a deceleration in the world's largest economy, and if we do see a sequential decline in U.S. consumer/producer price indices next week as well as the retail sales number, then that could prick that U.S. exceptionalism trade that's been dominating markets for quite a long time.\"\n\nThe dollar index,which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.21% at 105.29, with the euro up 0.27% at $1.0774.\n\nSterling strengthened 0.1% to $1.2509 in the wake of the U.S. data. The pound had dropped to a low of $1.2446, its weakest level since April 24, after the Bank of England (BoE) paved the way for an interest rate cut.\n\nThe BoE's Monetary Policy Committee had voted 7-2 to keep the central bank's key policy rate at a 16-year high of 5.25%, with Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden joining Swati Dhingra in voting for a cut to 5%.

It has since strengthened amid speculation about two interventions by Japanese authorities.\n\n\"The Japanese are not aiming at a particularly strong yen. I think they're aiming at a relatively stable yen -- they don't want it to go through the floor anymore,\" Roche, president and global strategist at Independent Strategy, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Thursday.\n\nJapan has acted in way so as \"not to create inflation, which undermines the governor of Bank of Japan.\"\n\nThe weakness in the yen had persisted after the BOJ's monetary policy decision in April and in spite of warnings from Japanese authorities.\n\nReportedly, Japanese authorities could have spent about $60 billion to prop up the yen after its sharp fall last week. The yen was last trading at around 155.61 against the dollar.\n\nThe summary of the BOJ's latest policy meeting released Thursday revealed that the central bank was concerned that a sharply weaker yen risks driving up import prices.\n\n\"The recent depreciation of the yen and rises in prices, such as crude oil, have started to affect producer prices through an increase in import prices,\" the BOJ policy board members said at their last meeting that concluded on April 26.\n\n\"While the yen's depreciation is likely to push down the economy in the short run through price rises driven by cost-push factors, it could push up underlying inflation in the medium to long run\" the members said.\n\nJapan could not \"possibly speak to have policy that really results in a strong yen unless they tighten monetary policy,\" Roche said, adding that it would involve raising interest rates by at least 50 basis points and allowing \"unsterilized intervention\" of the yen.\n\n\"In other words, it shrinks the supply of domestic money.

That could push competitive tensions with exporting neighbours South Korea and Taiwan to a peak - and heap pressure on China where chatter is already growing about the potential for a yuan devaluation.\n\nA destabilising slump in the yen could be the trigger that forces Japan's neighbours to take extreme action, goes the theory, even if their efforts to date have been to prop up currencies instead of capitulating and letting them slide. While a minority view and not one that suggests a repeat of the Asian financial crisis, it's still gaining some traction in a scenario where a resurgent US dollar stays stronger for longer.\n\n\"We haven't heard this word competitive devaluation for a long time,\" said Henry Quek, head of global markets, Asia-Pacific at State Street. But \"we are in a situation where there is a potential for a series of competitive devaluations if the yen continues to weaken much, much further.\"\n\nWhile Asian central banks have been actively supporting their currencies against the US dollar, the fall in the yen has been the worst in the region, eroding the export competitiveness of Japan's close neighbours. That's bound to grate even if the reasons for the yen's decline are not exclusively in Tokyo's control - the wide gulf in interest rates between Japan and the rest of the world and an investor preference for US assets.\n\nThe yen fell to its lowest since 1992 against the yuan - the currency of Japan's biggest trading partner - in late April. It's near the weakest versus the won since 2008 and at a 31-year low against the Taiwan dollar.\n\n\"It is happening,\" said Kisoo Park, a senior portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, when asked about competitive devaluation. \"Whether it's intentional or unintentional devaluation it is happening and it is having an impact on the rest of the region.\"\n\nDespite not having as strong an influence as in the past, a disorderly slump in the yen can still have a gravitational pull on the region's currencies, according to market watchers.\n\n\"Most directly, a materially weaker yen will pull along with it other Asia foreign exchange like the Korean won and Taiwan dollar,\" said Arjun Vij, a portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management.\n\nFor Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at ANZ Group Holdings Ltd., the won and Taiwanese dollar will likely struggle to benefit from the artificial intelligence investment boom in those countries until the yen turns the corner.\n\nTo be sure, there are signs that Japanese authorities may not allow the country's currency to slump further. After falling below the psychological milestone of 160 per US dollar for the first time in over three decades last week, two rounds of suspected official intervention have helped it stabilise to around the 155 level.\n\nAnd there's little concern about a financial crisis in the region with most Asian countries better equipped to avoid a repeat of the turbulence in the late 1990s. There are stronger stockpiles of foreign reserves, reforms from tighter financial sector oversight and deeper local capital markets.\n\nBut for Manulife's Park, a yen slump to the 170 to 180 per US dollar level would not only cause problems for Asia, but also impact emerging-market currencies more broadly. That's in large part due to the yen's role as a funding currency for carry traders, who borrow where rates are low and invest in developing nations where they are high.\n\n\"If Asian currencies devalue because of the strong dollar, the funds that invest in local markets will have to pull out,\" he said. \"The whole EM market will crash and that's going to cause a risk-off event where Treasuries will rally and equities will sell-off.\"\n\nWhile such a scenario is a low-probability event, it can't be ruled out, he added.\n\nA key wild card is what China will do with the yuan, which is at risk of being pulled down by the yen and destabilising the region. China's managed currency is seen as an anchor for its peers, meaning even small moves can have an outsized impact.\n\nThere is already quiet yet mounting speculation that Beijing may need to take an extreme measure to support its moribund economy - devalue the yuan in a big-bang move.\n\n\"When you look at Asia as a whole and observe the extraordinary yen weakness we have seen, we start to get concerned about relative levels of competitiveness, particularly with China,\" said John Woods, chief investment officer for Asia-Pacific at Lombard Odier Hong Kong. \"So to me, that is a risk that I'm quite focused on in the Asia space right now.\" BLOOMBERG", "source": {"uri": "businesstimes.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

BoE Governor Andrew Bailey said it was possible the central bank would need to cut rates by more than investors expect.

Losses in the greenback came as nonfarm payrolls data read weaker than expected for April.\n\nThe data furthered bets that a cooling labor market will give the Federal Reserve more impetus to begin cutting interest rates.

"Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher Wednesday, bouncing from recent weakness with a number of Fed officials set to speak.\n\nAt 04:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 105.500, climbing away from last week's roughly one-month low.\n\nMore Fed speak awaits\n\nThe dollar received a minor boost late Tuesday after Minneapolis Fed boss Neel Kashkari suggested that stubborn inflation and a robust economy could persuade the U.S. central bank to keep interest rates unchanged for the rest of this year.\n\nThe path of U.S. interest rates continues to dominate the market's attention, and with no top tier U.S. economic data due this week the opinions of policymakers take on added importance.\n\nFed Chair Jay Powell basically ruled out more tightening last week, but there exists a great deal of uncertainty over when a move lower will occur.\n\nInvestors have no shortage of Fed officials to look forward to on Wednesday, with Vice Chair Philip Jefferson , Governor Lisa Cook and Boston Fed President Susan Collins all due to speak.\n\nMorgan Stanley now expects the Fed to start lowering interest rates from September, compared to its earlier forecast of July, while continuing to see three 25-basis-point rate cuts through the year.\n\n\"A reversal in key components points to disinflation ahead, but given the lack of progress in recent months it will take a bit longer for the FOMC to gain confidence to take the first step,\" the bank said in a note dated May 7.\n\n\"The renewed contraction in industrial production in March after two months of expansion is a reminder that the German economy is still struggling,\" said analysts at Capital Economics.\n\nThe European Central Bank has signalled a rate cut in June, but there remains a great deal of uncertainty over what happens with monetary policy after this.\n\nGBP/USD traded 0.3% lower to 1.2473, ahead of Thursday's meeting of the Bank of England .\n\nThe U.K. central bank is not expected to change interest rates this week, there's speculation that it may guide markets towards a cut as soon as next month - shortly after the ECB is expected to cut on June 6.\n\nYen falls despite intervention talk\n\nIn Asia, USD/JPY rose 0.4% to 155.35, with the yen weakening, moving back towards 34-year highs of over 160 hit last week, even as government officials kept up their warnings of more potential intervention in currency markets.\n\nBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said on Wednesday the central bank may take monetary policy action if yen declines affect prices significantly, while the country's Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki repeated a warning that authorities were ready to respond to

Ultimately, this is a market that the interest rate differential will continue to cause major issues for the Bank of Japan and the Japanese yen. So, with that being said, I think it's probably only a matter of time before we reach the highs again. And now I would anticipate that the 155 yen level could be short-term support. Keep in mind that the Bank of Japan has intervened from time to time over the last couple of weeks, but really at the end of the day, there's only so much they can do.\n\nAfter all, institutional investors get paid to hang on to this pair as the interest rate differential is wide enough to make the risk of intervention worth it. Furthermore, if you are not overly levered, a 100 pip pullback won't necessarily hurt you. The 50 day EMA sits below and just above the crucial 152 yen level, we had seen the market turn around. So, I think all of that combines quite nicely for a market that remains buy on the dip.\n\nI do think eventually we break the highs and go much higher than this, but perhaps the Japanese just got a little bit nervous about the extreme pace of strength that we had seen against its currency. Ultimately, we could go as high as 200 yen until something breaks.

We will continue to take the same firm approach as we have in the past.\"\n\nTokyo is suspected to have intervened on at least two separate days last week to support the yen after it tumbled to lows last seen more than three decades ago.\n\nBank of Japan data suggested authorities spent more than 9 trillion yen (S$79 billion) in defence of its currency, helping lift the yen from a 34-year low of 160.245 per dollar to a roughly one-month high of 151.86 over the span of a week.\n\nThe yen was last trading around 154.27 in early Asia.\n\nKanda said it is normal practice for a currency authority to not comment on whether it has carried out market intervention, when asked about recent speculations that Japan has conducted yen-buying interventions.\n\nA weaker yen is a boon for Japanese exporters, but a headache for policymakers as it increases import costs, adds to inflationary pressures and squeezes households.\n\nKanda also noted that a number of countries in addition to Japan had expressed serious concerns about foreign exchange market volatility in a meeting leading up to a Asean+3 finance ministers and central bank governors conference in the Georgian capital Tbilisi last week.\n\nAsean+3 groups the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) as well as Japan, China and South Korea.\n\n\"The current concerns are not confined to Japan,\" Kanda said.

Investing.com", "body": "Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher Wednesday, bouncing from recent weakness with a number of Fed officials set to speak.\n\nAt 04:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 105.500, climbing away from last week's roughly one-month low.\n\nThe dollar received a minor boost late Tuesday after Minneapolis Fed boss Neel Kashkari suggested that stubborn inflation and a robust economy could persuade the U.S. central bank to keep interest rates unchanged for the rest of this year.\n\nThe path of U.S. interest rates continues to dominate the market's attention, and with no top tier U.S. economic data due this week the opinions of policymakers take on added importance.\n\nFed Chair Jay Powell basically ruled out more tightening last week, but there exists a great deal of uncertainty over when a move lower will occur.\n\nInvestors have no shortage of Fed officials to look forward to on Wednesday, with Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Governor Lisa Cook and Boston Fed President Susan Collins all due to speak.\n\nMorgan Stanley now expects the Fed to start lowering interest rates from September, compared to its earlier forecast of July, while continuing to see three 25-basis-point rate cuts through the year.\n\n\"A reversal in key components points to disinflation ahead, but given the lack of progress in recent months it will take a bit longer for the FOMC to gain confidence to take the first step,\" the bank said in a note dated May 7.\n\nIn Europe, EUR/USD traded 0.2% lower to 1.0736, after data showed that German industrial production declined 0.4% in March on a monthly basis.\n\n\"The renewed contraction in industrial production in March after two months of expansion is a reminder that the German economy is still struggling,\" said analysts at Capital Economics.\n\nThe European Central Bank has signalled a rate cut in June, but there remains a great deal of uncertainty over what happens with monetary policy after this.\n\nGBP/USD traded 0.3% lower to 1.2473, ahead of Thursday's meeting of the Bank of England.\n\nThe U.K. central bank is not expected to change interest rates this week, there's speculation that it may guide markets towards a cut as soon as next month - shortly after the ECB is expected to cut on June 6.\n\nIn Asia, USD/JPY rose 0.4% to 155.35, with the yen weakening, moving back towards 34-year highs of over 160 hit last week, even as government officials kept up their warnings of more potential intervention in currency markets.\n\nBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said on Wednesday the central bank may take monetary policy action if yen declines affect prices significantly, while the country's Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki repeated a warning that authorities were ready to respond to excessively volatile moves in the currency market.\n\nAUD/USD fell 0.4% to 0.6568, extending steep declines from the prior session after the Reserve Bank of Australia struck a less hawkish tone than traders were expecting.\n\nWhile the RBA held rates steady and warned that inflation will remain sticky in the coming months, it stopped short of threatening to hike rates further - a scenario that had been priced into the Aussie in the lead-up to the meeting.", "source": {"uri":

Market pricing went from showing even one rate cut in 2024 looking less likely to almost two being priced in by Friday, after monthly employment data suggested the labour market is softening.\n\nA hefty sell-off in U.S. stocks early in the week, accelerated by volatile earnings, reversed, sending the benchmark S&P 500 index up by the most in a day since February after Friday's payrolls report, and adding to gains on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. futures pointed to a steady start later on, while stocks in Europe caught a bid from the banks, where UBS and Unicredit beat expectations, sending the STOXX 600 up 0.6%.\n\nMSCI's All-World index was up 0.1%, around its highest since April 10.\n\n\"We remain in the camp that the right question is not whether we will get one or two rate cuts from the Fed this year,\" Jefferies strategist Mohit Kumar said.\n\n\"As long as the optionality of Fed cuts on any weakness remains, the Fed put is intact which will continue to support risky assets,\" he said.\n\nThe \"Fed put\" refers to a belief among investors that the central bank will step in to support the economy and financial markets in times of turmoil.\n\nFutures show traders believe U.S. rates will drop by around 45 basis points this year, from 5.25-5.50% right now. This time last week, just 28 bps were priced in.\n\nOn the earnings front, Disney, Occidental Petroleum and Wynn Resorts are due to report.\n\nThe mood set by last week's softer-than-expected U.S. jobs data was further underpinned by remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterating that the next move in rates will be lower.\n\nTreasuries, which rallied on Friday's jobs figures, traded steady in New York overnight and 10-year yields held at 4.49% in Tokyo on Tuesday. Interest rates markets price at least one U.S. rate cut this year, in November.\n\nDemand will be tested at a $58 billion three-year note auction on Tuesday, which is followed by $42 billion in 10-year sales on Wednesday and $25 billion of 30-year sales on Thursday.\n\nExpectations of falling rates have weighed on the dollar, though only gently. European policymakers are readying cuts for June, capping the euro, and rates are not expected to move too far above zero in Japan this year, leaving a wide gap with the rest of the world.\n\nThe dollar rose 0.6% on the yen on Monday and a further 0.3% to 154.31 yen on Tuesday, keeping markets on edge as to whether Japanese authorities may step in again.\n\nTraders estimate Japan spent almost $60 billion defending the yen last week.\n\nAustralia's central bank left interest rates on hold, as expected, but the Aussie dollar slipped about 0.4% to $0.6599 after policymakers did not strengthen guidance around the risk of another rate hike.\n\nSterling eased 0.2% to $1.254, while the euro was 0.1% lower at $1.07628.\n\nIn commodities, oil held steady, with Brent crude futures up 0.1% to $83.41 a barrel with a ceasefire deal in the Middle East proving elusive.

It is a question that is undoubtedly preying on the minds of Japanese policymakers as an analysis of the accounts of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) indicates they deployed tens of billions of dollars last week to prop up the yen after the currency fell to a fresh 34-year low against the US dollar.\n\nHaving strengthened 3.3 per cent versus the US dollar last week, the yen has resumed its decline, sliding back towards the 160 per dollar level that triggered the suspected intervention. It is down more than 10 per cent against the dollar this year, taking its losses during the past three years to a staggering 43 per cent.\n\nThat Japan\u2019s currency continues to weaken, despite the BOJ\u2019s momentous decision in March to raise borrowing costs for the first time since 2007, speaks volumes about the forces driving currency markets.\n\nInterest rate differentials are the only game in town right now. Benchmark rates in the United States are at 5.25 to 5.5 per cent versus 0 to 0.1 per cent in Japan, increasing the appeal of investing in higher-yielding US dollar-denominated assets. Moreover, bets that the US Federal Reserve would cut rates this year have been scaled back dramatically, underpinning a sharp rally in the US dollar since mid-March.\n\nThe US currency\u2019s strength reflects the resilience of the country\u2019s economy, especially the its persistently tight labour market. A stronger economy means more inflationary pressure. Progress towards the Fed\u2019s 2 per cent inflation target has stalled, with the central bank\u2019s preferred gauge of prices reaccelerating in the first quarter of this year.\n\nThe prospect of \u201chigher for longer\u201d interest rates and a \u201cstronger for longer\u201d US dollar has hit Asian markets particularly hard. The yen is the most extreme example of a region-wide vulnerability. With the exception of India, interest rates in Asia\u2019s main economies are significantly lower than in the US, unlike in Latin America and Eastern Europe, where borrowing costs in the leading markets remain higher despite the start of monetary easing cycles.\n\nThis puts Asia at a disadvantage, especially when hopes that the Fed would cut rates this year have faded. HSBC notes that \u201clower-yielding Asian currencies are bearing the brunt of the repricing of [US monetary policy]\u201d as investors \u201cfocus on the relative level of interest rates\u201d.\n\nAsian currencies, including the Malaysian ringgit and the Thai baht, are being used as funding currencies in \u201ccarry trades\u201d, putting them under strain when they are sold to carry out purchases of higher-yielding currencies such as the US dollar.\n\nEven Asian markets with higher borrowing costs have suffered. The Indian rupee has fallen to a record low versus the US dollar while Indonesia\u2019s central bank unexpectedly raised rates last month to defend the rupiah. Weak exchange rates amplify the impact of the recent rise in oil prices \u2013 a bigger threat to Asia given the region\u2019s status as a net energy importer \u2013 and fan inflationary pressures.\n\nThe plunge in the yen has focused attention on the yuan, a regional currency anchor. While a sudden 2015-style devaluation is unlikely, given bitter memories of the loss of confidence and capital flight the surprise policy move engendered, the strong US dollar has accentuated Beijing\u2019s conflicting priorities.\n\nLoosening monetary policy further to counter the downturn while simultaneously maintaining financial stability, easing trade tensions and keeping the yuan relatively stable looks like a bridge too far.\n\nTo be sure, parts of Asia\u2019s economies benefit from the rally in the US dollar. Companies that derive a large share of their revenues from exports to the US stand to gain from a stronger-for-longer American currency. Goldman Sachs notes that while 10 per cent of the revenues of companies in an index of Asian stocks that excludes China are from mainland China, 17 per cent are from the US.\n\nTaiwanese, South Korean and Japanese firms have the highest sales exposure to the US, as much as 30 per cent in the case of Taiwan. This partly explains why the shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world\u2019s largest contract chip maker, are up more than 40 per cent this year.\n\nHowever, a supercharged US dollar is a red rag to a protectionist bull, especially in the run-up to hugely consequential presidential election. Unlike US President Joe Biden, Donald Trump is very vocal about the value of the dollar, which he views through the prism of the persistent US trade deficit.\n\nAccording to Politico, advisers to Trump led by Robert Lighthizer, the architect of the former president\u2019s tariffs against China, are debating ways to weaken the US dollar. This is easier said than done. Trump\u2019s threats to impose new tariffs, coupled with his penchant for tax cuts, are likely to strengthen the dollar, partly by fuelling inflation \u2013 which would make it more likely that the Fed would resume its tightening campaign.\n\nWhat is clear is that Asia should not bank on a weaker US dollar if Trump recaptures the White House. The only way the currency is going to fall meaningfully is if the US economy slows sharply and the Fed cuts rates sooner and at a faster pace than markets anticipate. This is unlikely to happen this year. King Dollar will remain a source of angst for Asian policymakers for some time yet.\n\nNicholas Spiro is a partner at Lauressa Advisory", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The dollar is on the front foot and gunning for 156.00 yen.\n\nThere are a few potential market-moving economic indicators and events on Thursday for investors to get their teeth into, including Chinese trade data, a monetary policy decision from Malaysia, and first quarter GDP figures from the Philippines.\n\nAsian markets won't get much steer from Wall Street, which ended mixed on Wednesday. One source of relief may be oil - Brent crude printed a two-month low below $82 a barrel, and although inflation worries are running high, oil is down around 10% in recent weeks.\n\nJapan's financial heavy hitters were out on Wednesday warning that the yen's weakness could trigger action from policymakers.\n\nBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said the central bank could raise rates again, and Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki voiced \"strong concern\" over the negative impact of a weak yen and repeated Tokyo's readiness to intervene in the FX market.\n\nThe warnings have had no effect and the dollar was changing hands at 155.50 yen late on Wednesday, up on the day and back to where it was at the BOJ's April 26 policy announcement. It is now only two yen away from where it was when Japan carried out its second suspected round of intervention on May 1.\n\nOn the data front, figures from Beijing are expected to show Chinese imports and exports swung to year-on-year growth in April. But export growth is expected to be modest as factory owners wrestle with weak overseas demand and overcapacity.\n\nTrade relations between China and the West remain fraught, with the latest twist coming from U.S. tech giant Intel saying its sales would take a hit after the U.S. revoked some of the chipmaker's export licenses for a customer in China.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will leave its key interest rate at 3.00% for as sixth consecutive meeting and keep it there at least until 2026, despite a weakening currency and a steady inflation outlook, according to a Reuters poll of economists.\n\nFigures from Manila, meanwhile, are expected to show that the Philippines' economy expanded at an annual rate of 5.9% in the first quarter, but quarter-on-quarter growth is expected to halve to 1.0% from 2.1% in the October-December period.\n\nThe Japanese earnings season rolls on, with major companies including Nissan, Nippon Steel, Panasonic and Softbank reporting full-year 2024 results on Thursday.\n\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:\n\n(Reporting and Writing by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Josie Kao)", "source": {"uri":

edges higher, helped by hawkish Fed speakers ; Sterling slips ahead of BOE", "body": "After-hours movers: Palantir, Microchip, Coherent, Hims & Hers Health\n\nInvesting.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher Thursday, trading in a tight range ahead of next week's all-important U.S. inflation data, while the pound slipped ahead of the Bank of England's policy-setting meeting.\n\nAt 04:35 ET (08:35 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 105.605, rebounding after last week's one-month low.\n\nTight trading range ahead of US CPI\n\nThe dollar has steadied this week, after last week's sharp losses, after a number of Fed officials have pushed back against the idea that rate cuts are a certainty this year.\n\nMinneapolis Fed boss Neel Kashkari suggested on Tuesday that stubborn inflation and a robust economy could persuade the U.S. central bank to keep interest rates unchanged for the rest of this year.\n\nFed Bank of Boston President Susan Collins continued the theme on Wednesday, saying that the U.S. economy needs to cool to return inflation back to target.\n\nThere are more speakers due both Thursday and Friday, as well as weekly jobless claims data.\n\nHowever, trading ranges are likely to be limited ahead of next week's April U.S. producer price index and, in particular, the consumer price index, which traders will watch for signs that inflation has resumed its downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target rate.\n\nSterling slips ahead of BOE meeting\n\nIn Europe, GBP/USD traded 0.2% lower to 1.2475, ahead of the latest Bank of England rate-setting meeting.\n\nThe U.K. central bank is not expected to move interest rates later Thursday, and thus the big question is whether the officials signal that a cut will come in June, when the European Central Bank has already signalled it will.\n\nA cut is fully priced for August and last week sterling short positions rose to their largest since January 2023, so sterling could be volatile if post-meeting guidance doesn't match up to the market's expectations.\n\nIn Europe, EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower to 1.0732, trading largely unchanged given a light data calendar.\n\n\"It's hard to see EUR/USD breaking far from 1.0750, unless the BoE is demonstrably dovish and GBP/USD drags EUR/USD lower with it,\" said ana;ysts at ING, in a note.\n\nYen drifts lower despite rate hike talk\n\nIn Asia, USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 155.87, with the yen remaining weak despite hawkish opinions from Bank of Japan's members.\n\nThe BOJ's summary of opinions released earlier Thursday showed board members were overwhelmingly hawkish at their April policy meeting with many calling for steady interest rate hikes.\n\nBOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda also warned that any inflationary pressures arising from weakness in the yen could invite monetary tightening by the central bank.\n\nThat said, the yen has still resumed its decline even after a couple bouts of suspected intervention.\n\nUSD/CNY rose 0.1% to 7.2260, with the yuan struggling to maintain earlier gains after data showed Chinese imports grew substantially more than expected in April, signaling some strength in domestic demand.", "source": {"uri": "streetinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StreetInsider.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

yen falls again By Investing.com", "body": "Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher in early European trade Tuesday, attempting a comeback after the sharp losses at the end of last week, while the Japanese yen retreated despite more intervention threats.\n\nAt 04:35 ET (08:35 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.12% higher at 105.090, after falling as low as 104.52 on Friday, the lowest level for just under a month.\n\nThe dollar has steadied Tuesday currencies, recovering slightly from last week's losses after softer-than-expected nonfarm payrolls data saw traders once again begin pricing in interest rate cuts by the central bank.\n\nTraders are now pricing in September as the favorite month for the Federal Reserve to start its rate-cutting cycle.\n\nThe economic calendar is light in the week ahead so the focus will be on several Fed policymakers who are due to speak.\n\nRichmond Fed President Thomas Barkin has already started the ball rolling, saying interest rates in the U.S. currently stand at such \"restrictive\" heights that they can help tamp down demand and cool sticky inflationary pressures.\n\n\"It looks like Friday's slightly softer U.S. jobs report has been enough to put paid to any ideas of a Fed hike this year,\" analysts at ING said, in a note. \"And whilst the pricing of the Fed easing cycle this year has grown (45bp of cuts now expected for this year), the biggest impact of last week's FOMC/NFP double-header has been the decline in cross-market volatility.\"\n\nIn Europe, EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower to 1.0760, after data showed that German exports rebounded in March, buoyed by strong U.S. and Chinese demand for German-made goods, but a disappointing month for industrial orders dashed hopes for a swift economic recovery.\n\nThe European Central Bank has signalled a rate cut in June, but there remains a great deal of uncertainty over what happens with monetary policy after this.\n\nGBP/USD traded 0.2% lower to 1.2534, ahead of Thursday's meeting of the Bank of England.\n\n\"Our core view is that it will still be a little early for the BoE to shift its cautionary position and signal a June rate cut,\" said ING, with the bank looking for a cut in August rather than June.\n\n\"However, a June BoE rate cut is only 30% priced by the market and we doubt sterling has to rally too hard if the BoE's language on Thursday is unchanged.\"\n\nIn Asia, USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 154.13, bouncing after the pair sank as low as 151.86 on Friday for the first time since April 10, as softer-than-expected monthly U.S. jobs data added to Bank of Japan data that suggested official intervention could have amounted to over $58 billion.\n\nThe yen has resumed its fall despite Japan's government's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda saying on Tuesday that it may have to take action against any disorderly, speculative-driven foreign exchange moves.\n\nAUD/USD pair rose 0.4% to 0.6599, after the RBA kept rates steady as widely expected and warned that inflation will take longer to come down in the near-term.\n\nBut the RBA stopped short of mentioning any plans for further rate hikes, disappointing traders that were positioning for such signals, especially after a hotter-than-expected inflation reading for the first quarter.", "source": {"uri":

One source of relief may be oil - Brent crude printed a two-month low below $82 a barrel, and although inflation worries are running high, oil is down around 10% in recent weeks.\n\nJapan's financial heavy hitters were out on Wednesday warning that the yen's weakness could trigger action from policymakers.\n\nBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said the central bank could raise rates again, and Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki voiced \"strong concern\" over the negative impact of a weak yen and repeated Tokyo's readiness to intervene in the FX market.\n\nThe warnings have had no effect and the dollar was changing hands at 155.50 yen late on Wednesday, up on the day and back to where it was at the BOJ's April 26 policy announcement. It is now only two yen away from where it was when Japan carried out its second suspected round of intervention on May 1.\n\nOn the data front, figures from Beijing are expected to show Chinese imports and exports swung to year-on-year growth in April. But export growth is expected to be modest as factory owners wrestle with weak overseas demand and overcapacity.\n\nTrade relations between China and the West remain fraught, with the latest twist

helped by hawkish Fed speakers ; Sterling slips ahead of BOE By Investing.com", "body": "Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher Thursday, trading in a tight range ahead of next week's all-important U.S. inflation data, while the pound slipped ahead of the Bank of England's policy-setting meeting.\n\nAt 04:35 ET (08:35 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 105.605, rebounding after last week's one-month low.\n\nThe dollar has steadied this week, after last week's sharp losses, after a number of Fed officials have pushed back against the idea that rate cuts are a certainty this year.\n\nMinneapolis Fed boss Neel Kashkari suggested on Tuesday that stubborn inflation and a robust economy could persuade the U.S. central bank to keep interest rates unchanged for the rest of this year.\n\nFed Bank of Boston President Susan Collins continued the theme on Wednesday, saying that the U.S. economy needs to cool to return inflation back to target.\n\nThere are more speakers due both Thursday and Friday, as well as weekly jobless claims data.\n\nHowever, trading ranges are likely to be limited ahead of next week's April U.S. producer price index and, in particular, the consumer price index, which traders will watch for signs that inflation has resumed its downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target rate.\n\nIn Europe, GBP/USD traded 0.2% lower to 1.2475, ahead of the latest Bank of England rate-setting meeting.\n\nThe U.K. central bank is not expected to move interest rates later Thursday, and thus the big question is whether the officials signal that a cut will come in June, when the European Central Bank has already signalled it will.\n\nA cut is fully priced for August and last week sterling short positions rose to their largest since January 2023, so sterling could be volatile if post-meeting guidance doesn't match up to the market's expectations.\n\nIn Europe, EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower to 1.0732, trading largely unchanged given a light data calendar.\n\n\"It's hard to see EUR/USD breaking far from 1.0750, unless the BoE is demonstrably dovish and GBP/USD drags EUR/USD lower with it,\" said ana;ysts at ING, in a note.\n\nIn Asia, USD/JPY rose 0.3% to 155.87, with the yen remaining weak despite hawkish opinions from Bank of Japan's members.\n\nThe BOJ's summary of opinions released earlier Thursday showed board members were overwhelmingly hawkish at their April policy meeting with many calling for steady interest rate hikes.\n\nBOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda also warned that any inflationary pressures arising from weakness in the yen could invite monetary tightening by the central bank.\n\nThat said, the yen has still resumed its decline even after a couple bouts of suspected intervention.\n\nUSD/CNY rose 0.1% to 7.2260, with the yuan struggling to maintain earlier gains after data showed Chinese imports grew substantially more than expected in April, signaling some strength in domestic demand.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Japanese yen is back in the spotlight, its latest bout of weakness prompting warnings from Tokyo on Wednesday that, so far at least, seem to have gone unheeded. The dollar is on the front foot and gunning for 156.00 yen. There are a few potential market-moving economic indicators and events on Thursday for investors to get their teeth into, including Chinese trade data, a monetary policy decision from Malaysia, and first quarter GDP figures from the Philippines.\n\nAsian markets won't get much steer from Wall Street, which ended mixed on Wednesday. One source of relief may be oil - Brent crude printed a two-month low below $82 a barrel, and although inflation worries are running high, oil is down around 10% in recent weeks.\n\nJapan's financial heavy hitters were out on Wednesday warning that the yen's weakness could trigger action from policymakers.\n\nBank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda said the central bank could raise rates again, and Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki voiced \"strong concern\" over the negative impact of a weak yen and repeated Tokyo's readiness to intervene in the FX market.\n\nThe warnings have had no effect and the dollar was changing hands at 155.50 yen late on Wednesday, up on the day and back to where it was at the BOJ's April 26 policy announcement. It is now only two yen away from where it was when Japan carried out its second suspected round of intervention on May 1.\n\nOn the data front, figures from Beijing are expected to show Chinese imports and exports swung to year-on-year growth in April. But export growth is expected to be modest as factory owners wrestle with weak overseas demand and overcapacity. Trade relations between China and the West remain fraught, with the latest twist coming from U.S. tech giant Intel saying its sales would take a hit after the U.S. revoked some of the chipmaker's export licenses for a customer in China.\n\nBank Negara Malaysia will leave its key interest rate at 3.00% for as sixth consecutive meeting and keep it there at least until 2026, despite a weakening currency and a steady inflation outlook, according to a Reuters poll of economists. Figures from Manila, meanwhile, are expected to show that the Philippines' economy expanded at an annual rate of 5.9% in the first quarter, but quarter-on-quarter growth is expected to halve to 1.0% from 2.1% in the October-December period. The Japanese earnings season rolls on, with major companies including Nissan, Nippon Steel, Panasonic and Softbank reporting full-year 2024 results on Thursday.\n\nHere are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Thursday:\n\n- China trade (April)\n\n- Malaysia interest rate decision\n\n- Philippines GDP (Q1)\n\n(Reporting and Writing by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Josie

falls again", "body": "Investing.com - The U.S. dollar edged higher in early European trade Tuesday, attempting a comeback after the sharp losses at the end of last week, while the Japanese yen retreated despite more intervention threats.\n\nAt 04:35 ET (08:35 GMT), the Dollar Index , which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.12% higher at 105.090, after falling as low as 104.52 on Friday, the lowest level for just under a month.\n\nDollar steadies after Friday's drop\n\nThe dollar has steadied Tuesday currencies, recovering slightly from last week's losses after softer-than-expected nonfarm payrolls data saw traders once again begin pricing in interest rate cuts by the central bank.\n\nTraders are now pricing in September as the favorite month for the Federal Reserve to start its rate-cutting cycle.\n\nThe economic calendar is light in the week ahead so the focus will be on several Fed policymakers who are due to speak.\n\nRichmond Fed President Thomas Barkin has already started the ball rolling, saying interest rates in the U.S. currently stand at such \"restrictive\" heights that they can help tamp down demand and cool sticky inflationary pressures.\n\n\"It looks like Friday's slightly softer U.S. jobs report has been enough to put paid to any ideas of a Fed hike this year,\" analysts at ING said, in a note. \"And whilst the pricing of the Fed easing cycle this year has grown (45bp of cuts now expected for this year), the biggest impact of last week's FOMC/NFP double-header has been the decline in cross-market volatility.\"\n\nGerman industrial orders fall\n\nIn Europe, EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower to 1.0760, after data showed that German exports rebounded in March, buoyed by strong U.S. and Chinese demand for German-made goods, but a disappointing month for industrial orders dashed hopes for a swift economic recovery.\n\nThe European Central Bank has signalled a rate cut in June, but there remains a great deal of uncertainty over what happens with monetary policy after this.\n\nGBP/USD traded 0.2% lower to 1.2534, ahead of Thursday's meeting of the Bank of England .\n\n\"Our core view is that it will still be a little early for the BoE to shift its cautionary position and signal a June rate cut,\" said ING, with the bank looking for a cut in August rather than June.\n\n\"However, a June BoE rate cut is only 30% priced by the market and we doubt sterling has to rally too hard if the BoE's language on Thursday is unchanged.\"\n\nYen resumes its fall\n\nIn Asia, USD/JPY rose 0.2% to 154.13, bouncing after the pair sank as low as 151.86 on Friday for the first time since April 10, as softer-than-expected monthly U.S. jobs data added to Bank of Japan data that suggested official intervention could have amounted to over $58 billion.\n\nThe yen has resumed its fall despite Japan's government's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda saying on Tuesday that it may have to take action against any disorderly, speculative-driven foreign exchange moves.\n\nAUD/USD pair rose 0.4% to 0.6599, after the RBA kept rates steady as widely expected and warned that inflation will take longer to come down in the near-term.\n\nBut the RBA stopped short of mentioning any plans for further rate hikes, disappointing traders that were positioning for such signals, especially after a hotter-than-expected inflation reading for the first quarter.", "source": {"uri": "za.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com South Africa"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to Fed funds futures, there is a nearly 85% chance for a quarter-point cut to be delivered in September, while the total number of basis points worth of reductions expected by the end of the year has risen to 45.\n\nWhat may have also encouraged market participants to increase their cut bets were remarks by Fed officials John Williams and Thomas Barking, who corroborated Powell's view that rate hikes are unlikely and that eventually they will lower interest rates.\n\nWith that in mind, and in the absence of major US data, attention today is likely to fall on a speech by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari. Kashkari is an outspoken hawk and thus, traders may be eager to find out whether he agrees with his colleagues. If he shares the view that the next move in interest rates is most likely to be down, the dollar could suffer some more losses as investors lower their implied rate path a bit more.\n\nYen pulls back after strong weekThe yen entered this week on the back foot after ending its strongest week since early December 2022 due to two episodes of suspected intervention by Japanese authorities.\n\nAlthough the Japanese currency gained as much as 5.25% since the first intervention round that was triggered after dollar/yen poked its nose above 160, this week's slide corroborates the view that intervention on its own may not be enough to reverse the tide.\n\nYes, the chances for another strike by Japanese authorities remain elevated but for a yen recovery to be sustained, the BoJ may need to change the tone of its language as well. At its latest meeting, the Bank refrained from providing clear signals on whether another hike may be warranted soon, disappointing those expecting a summer move.\n\nAussie slips as RBA maintains neutral stanceThe aussie was the currency that took the most advantage of the dollar's slide since Friday, but it gave back a decent portion of those gains today after the RBA reiterated that the path of interest rates remains uncertain and that the Board is \"not ruling anything in or out.\"\n\nWith Australian inflation proving stickier than expected and the labor market remaining strong, investors may have been anticipating a hawkish shift by the RBA and thus, maintaining a neutral stance was seen as a disappointment.\n\nStocks gain as traders hope for earlier rate reliefWall Street cheered the prospect of more rate cuts by the Fed, with all three of its major indices closing in the green on Monday. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq gained more than 1%, with their technical pictures suggesting that the latest corrections are over and that the prevailing uptrends have been resumed.\n\nThe prospect of more basis points worth of Fed rate cuts by the end of the year may not be the sole driver though. A better-than-expected earnings season, with tech giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reporting that their growth continues to be driven by artificial intelligence (AI) investments, has also encouraged investors to add to their risk exposure.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_funds", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal funds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neel_Kashkari", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neel Kashkari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Futures contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545418", "eventUri": "eng-9545418", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Japan's Nikkei 225 index recently pushed into record territory after 34 years. Neither the British nor Japanese economies are exactly booming, so what is driving their stock markets' outperformance? What they have in common is an exposure to the mighty US dollar.\n\nBig UK and Japanese companies are particularly sensitive to the US currency for related but slightly different reasons. The FTSE 100 index has lots of dollar earners, operating in industries like mining, and oil and gas, whose products are priced in the US currency. The earnings of Shell and BP are worth a whole lot more to a British investor when they are translated back into sterling at $1.25 than they were at $2 to the pound before the financial crisis.\n\nJapan, meanwhile, is a net exporter whose products become more attractive when the dollar buys more yen. Ten years ago, a dollar secured just 80 yen; today it is twice as many. Those Japanese machine tools and cars suddenly look to be a bargain as the dollar appreciates.\n\nAnd how the dollar is rising. My daughter is on holiday in Japan at the moment, and dispatches from Tokyo refer to how \"insanely cheap\" the country is. My recent visit to New York, on the other hand, was notable for the eye-wateringly expensive prices in the Big Apple. Unsurprisingly, the Japanese have decided that Hawaii is beautiful but way too expensive.\n\nSo why is the dollar so strong today? Three reasons. First, the US economy is on fire. It has shrugged off the last two years' rising interest rates, creating new jobs, increasing wages and keeping a lid on unemployment. Money follows growth.\n\nThe second reason is those interest rates, which are showing no signs of pivoting lower anytime soon as inflation remains stubbornly above target. Higher yields attract yet more global money flows. Finally, the dollar is a safe haven. Always has been. And today's worrying geopolitics make the greenback look ever more like a port in the storm.\n\nThis all feels eerily familiar. When I went to study in America in 1985, my university teaching assistant's stipend felt like a king's ransom at the then-exchange rate of about $1.20 to the pound. A dollar was worth 80p then. Five years earlier it would have bought just 40p.\n\nHalf a decade of tight monetary policy under the Fed's determined chair, Paul Volcker, and loose fiscal policy in President Ronald Reagan's first term had pushed up bond yields and attracted global capital flows. Then as now, you wanted to be earning dollars, not trying to buy them.\n\nAt first, the US government was in favour of a strong dollar. It made Volcker's job of getting on top of inflation that bit easier. But American industry was suffering, the trade deficit was soaring, and Congress was drawing up protectionist legislation to backstop domestic manufacturers. The stage was set for the world's finance ministers to get together in New York's Plaza Hotel and thrash out a co-ordinated devaluation of the dollar.\n\nCurrency interventions have fallen out of favour since the 1980s for good reason. They tend to deliver unintended consequences. In the case of Japan, the success of the Plaza Accord led to a strengthening of the yen, which pushed the country towards recession, triggering massive monetary and fiscal expansions that in turn fuelled a disastrous asset price bubble. The bursting of that property and stock market boom scarred Japan for more than 30 years.\n\nThe strength of the dollar may feel like a good thing for UK investors today, but it comes at a cost. In theory it can balance unequal global growth, giving European and Asian exporters an edge in the strong US market. In practice it can make things worse. It raises the cost of borrowing in countries that are obliged to borrow in dollars and so squeezes global credit. The higher cost of servicing debts can easily outweigh the benefit of more competitive exports.\n\nBut the world may have to get used to a resurgent dollar. One or more of a handful of things would be required to reverse the direction of travel for global currencies. A coordinated intervention along the Plaza lines would help, but we are a long way off that today. Last week's attempt by the Japanese authorities to offload dollars had a short-term impact on the exchange rate but without global support it is a sticking plaster policy.\n\nStrong growth outside of America would help to narrow the interest rate differential that is likely to open up this year and next. But that looks unlikely, as this week's UK GDP figures are likely to demonstrate. The UK and Europe will cut rates before the Fed does.\n\nCheaper energy would help reduce America's advantage over the rest of the developed world, where it is unique in being a major exporter and so a beneficiary of a higher oil price. However, it is in too many countries' interests to keep the price of crude where it is. Finally, easing wage pressures would give the Fed cover to cut interest rates. But historically low unemployment makes that seem unlikely.\n\nOwning US assets could make sense in the current environment. Higher growth, higher yields and a rising currency offer UK-based investors several routes to a profitable investment. But high valuations and the requirement for earnings to continue growing in the face of higher for longer interest rates mean there are risks too.\n\nA safer way to play a strong dollar could be to bulk up on the out-of-favour UK stock market.

while the pound slipped ahead of the Bank of England's policy-setting meeting.\n\nAt 04:35 ET (08:35 GMT), the Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, traded 0.2% higher at 105.605, rebounding after last week's one-month low.\n\nTight trading range ahead of US CPI\n\nThe dollar has steadied this week, after last week's sharp losses, after a number of Fed officials have pushed back against the idea that rate cuts are a certainty this year.\n\nMinneapolis Fed boss Neel Kashkari suggested on Tuesday that stubborn inflation and a robust economy could persuade the U.S. central bank to keep interest rates unchanged for the rest of this year.\n\nFed Bank of Boston President Susan Collins continued the theme on Wednesday, saying that the U.S. economy needs to cool to return inflation back to target.\n\nThere are more speakers due both Thursday and Friday, as well as weekly jobless claims data.\n\nHowever, trading ranges are likely to be limited ahead of next week's April U.S. producer price index and, in particular, the consumer price index , which traders will watch for signs that inflation has resumed its downward trend toward the Fed's 2% target rate.\n\nThe U.K. central bank is not expected to move interest rates later Thursday, and thus the big question is whether the officials signal that a cut will come in June, when the European Central Bank has already signalled it will.\n\nA cut is fully priced for August and last week sterling short positions rose to their largest since January 2023, so sterling could be volatile if post-meeting guidance doesn't match up to the market's expectations.\n\nIn Europe, EUR/USD traded 0.1% lower to 1.0732, trading largely unchanged given a light data calendar.\n\n\"It's hard to see EUR/USD breaking far from 1.0750, unless the BoE is demonstrably dovish and GBP/USD drags EUR/USD lower with it,\" said ana;ysts at ING, in a note.\n\nThe BOJ's summary of opinions released earlier Thursday showed board members were overwhelmingly hawkish at their April policy meeting with many calling for steady interest rate hikes.\n\nBOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda also warned that any inflationary pressures arising from weakness in the yen could invite monetary tightening by the central bank.\n\nThat said, the yen has still resumed its decline even after a couple bouts of suspected intervention.\n\nUSD/CNY rose 0.1% to 7.2260, with the yuan struggling to maintain earlier gains after data showed Chinese imports grew substantially more than expected in April, signaling some strength in domestic demand.", "source": {"uri": "in.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Meanwhile, New York counterpart John Williams said that the timing of rate cuts will depend on the totality of the incoming data.\n\nThe dollar index, which was around 105 in early New York session, climbed to 105.45 before easing a bit to 105.37, still well above the previous close of 105.05.\n\nAgainst the Euro, the dollar firmed to 1.0756 after having weakened to 1.0790.

That's because the expectation is that when guests come to celebrate the newlywed couple, they'll give cash instead of, say, a toaster or coffeemaker. On the one hand, this saves you the trouble of having to go shopping if you get invited to a wedding. However, the rules of etiquette are pretty clear on how much you're supposed to give: 30,000 yen (roughly US$200).\n\nThat might not seem too steep for a close friend or relative, but 30,000 is the expectation regardless of your relationship to the bride and groom. Moderately friendly coworker? 30,000 yen. Old college classmate you've sort of drifted apart from? 30,000 yen. Oh, and that's 30,000 yen per person in your party; if you're attending the wedding as a couple, you and your significant other are each supposed to give that much.\n\nThose factors muddy the waters as to whether or not 30,000 yen is too much, so to get a better feel for attendees' opinions, Rexit, an online wedding planning portal, conducted an Internet survey, collecting responses from 361 men and women, 38.7 percent of whom were between the ages of 20 and 29. When those 20-somethings were asked \"Do you think 30,000 yen is expensive for a wedding gift?\", 64.3 percent said \"Yes, that's expensive.\"\n\nWith the current weak value of the yen versus foreign currencies, 30,000 yen may not sound like all that much when converted into U.S. dollars. However, to illustrate that 30,000 yen is nothing to sneeze at for those getting paid in yen, 2023 statistics from Japan's national tax agency shows that the average income in Japan for people aged 20 to 24 is 2,730,000 yen, and for those 25 to 29 it's 3,890,000. What's more, when the 20-to-29-year-old respondents in the survey were asked how much of their income they put into savings, 73 percent said they save 30,000 yen or less monthly.\n\nSavings per month\n\n\u25cf No savings: 19 percent\n\n\u25cf Under 5,000 yen: 15 percent\n\n\u25cf 5,000-10,000 yen: 18 percent\n\n\u25cf 10,000-30,000 yen: 21 percent\n\n\u25cf 30,000-50,000 yen: 10 percent\n\n\u25cf 50,000-70,000 yen: 7 percent\n\n\u25cf Over 70,000 yen: 10 percent\n\nThe financial strain can be especially tough for young Japanese people if they have a series of friends or other social acquaintances all getting married in their 20s, especially if they're clustered around the same time in fall and spring, the popular wedding seasons.\n\nThere are a few silver linings to all this. One is that, in keeping with traditional Japanese gift-giving customs, the bride and groom will often give some sort of \"in-return gift\" to their guests, such as fancy confectionaries, hand towels, or tableware, as a token of their appreciation. Another is that partially due to the expected 30,000 yen, Japanese spouses-to-be are often a little more selective with their wedding guest list. It's understood that the invitation comes bundled with a financial burden, so you're unlikely to get invited to, say, your second cousin's daughter's wedding three prefectures over. And last, there's no social stigma about showing up to a wedding dateless in Japan, so you're unlikely to get roped into going along to a wedding for your significant other's acquaintance who you've got no personal connection to, since they can just go by themselves.\n\nStill, even with all that, 30,000 yen feels like a lot to the 20-somethings who responded to the survey, so it's likely that even though they're being sincere when they tell the bride and groom \"Congratulations!\", deep down inside they're probably also thinking \"Man, this is costing a lot.\"", "source": {"uri": "soranews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SoraNews24 -Japan News-"}, "authors": [{"uri": "casey_baseel@soranews24.com", "name": "Casey Baseel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridegroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridegroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Etiquette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prefectures of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableware", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tableware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://soranews24.com/wp-content/themes/rocketnews-en/img/pts_logo_300x300.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545418", "eventUri": "eng-9545418", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, monetary officials stashed $362 billion at the Fed's reverse repurchase agreement facility, up from $360 billion a week earlier, according to the latest data from the central bank.\n\nThe figures showing the cash drain cover a week that included at least another instance where Japanese policymakers likely intervened in foreign-exchange markets to support the yen, which is the weakest Group-of-10 currency this year versus a broadly strengthening dollar.\n\nOn April 29, a holiday in Japan, the yen fell to a fresh 34-year low of 160.17 per dollar before sharply rebounding in thin trading. Following the conclusion of the Fed's two-day policy meeting three days later, the yen abruptly rallied more than 3% in the waning hours of the US trading day.\n\nLast week, data from the prior reporting period showed a $17.8 billion drop in balances in a separate cash account used by central bankers, suggesting these funds may have been tapped to prop up the currency at some point.\n\nHowever, historically, Japanese authorities haven't stockpiled their intervention resources at the Fed's non-interest-bearing foreign official deposits category, according to Wrightson ICAP. That points to the possibility that the latest drop in foreign central bank Treasury holdings may have also been used in efforts to support the yen.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has refrained from confirming interventions, but a Bloomberg analysis of Bank of Japan accounts suggest interventions took place. The estimates indicate that policymakers likely spent some \u00a59 trillion last week, or nearly $60 billion at current exchange rates, to bolster the currency -- an amount on par with previous interventions that last took place in the fall of 2022.\n\nJapan's foreign currency reserves were worth about $1.14 trillion at the end of April, falling by $14.2 billion from the previous month, according to the latest data from the country's Ministry of Finance. That was driven by a drop in foreign securities, which declined by about $17 billion to $978 billion.

The Swedish crown fell sharply after Sweden's central bank unexpectedly cut rates and forecasted additional cuts, impacting European currencies. The British pound showed vulnerability ahead of the Bank of England's policy meeting, highlighting a cautious approach among traders.\n\nThe yen's depreciation continues to draw attention, with the currency weakening for the third consecutive day.

Markets are pricing an almost 50-50 chance for a rate cut in June, so the question for traders is whether the Bank will signal that such a move is imminent or downplay it.\n\nBritain's economy seems to have escaped the shallow recession it fell into last year, with incoming business surveys pointing to an economy that has entered the recovery phase, powered by a rebound in consumer spending as wage growth has remained resilient.\n\nThe dark side of this economic resurgence is that inflation remains persistently hot. Core inflation held above 4% in March and business surveys warn of a reacceleration moving forward, as companies lift their prices to pass rising costs onto consumers.\n\nConsidering the persistence of inflationary pressures, the Bank of England will probably be reluctant to signal that rate cuts are imminent and might play down the likelihood of a cut in June.\n\nIn isolation, a message that rate cuts are still some distance away could benefit the pound, especially since speculators are net short on the currency. That said, the broader FX reaction will also depend on the updated economic forecasts and the vote composition of the Monetary Policy Committee.\n\nYen lags despite positive BoJ rate signals\n\nOver in Japan, the yen has resumed its downtrend, surrendering a good chunk of the gains it recorded last week after two episodes of suspected FX intervention.\n\nThe striking part is that the yen remains on the ropes even despite the recent slide in US yields and mounting signs from the Bank of Japan that more rate increases are coming. The summary of opinions from the latest BoJ meeting revealed a growing consensus among policymakers to normalize further.\n\nStill, the yen could not capitalize on those hawkish signals, perhaps because incoming data pointed to a sharp slowdown in wage growth, which might prevent the BoJ from pulling the rate-hike trigger in the near future.\n\nAll told, the fundamental factors that pushed the yen to multi-decade lows are still present, so the outlook remains negative, although the constant threat of FX intervention might help ensure the currency doesn't hit new lows. A proper trend reversal in the yen will probably require interest rate differentials to narrow through Fed rate cuts, which is a longer-term story.\n\nDollar recovers, stocks and gold flat\n\nIn the absence of any real news this week, the US dollar has staged a stealth recovery, with some help from upward revisions in GDP growth estimates. The Atlanta Fed currently estimates GDP growth at 4.2% this quarter, reinforcing the notion that any Fed rate cuts are still far away.\n\nMeanwhile, US stock markets and gold prices traded in a quiet manner yesterday. Both equities and gold could remain in a holding pattern ahead of the next major catalyst, which will probably be the next batch of US inflation stats on Wednesday.\n\nFinally in China, local stock markets climbed today following some encouraging trade numbers.

That's been insufficient to bolster the currency which has fallen 1.6% so far this week.\n\n\"The market is betting that USD/JPY is now stuck in a range with topside capped at 160 by the authorities,\" Sharma said. \"This is best expressed by USD/JPY call RKOs and the market is starting to engage in those flows meaningfully.\"\n\nThese contracts are different from regular call options as they contain an additional condition that makes the deal worthless if the currency pair hits a so-called knock-out level. According to traders these levels are primarily in the 160.50-161 range, which is above the April 29 high of 160.17.\n\nThe demand for RKOs has narrowed the gap between the put and call option pricing to levels last seen in November, as the cost to protect against the dollar's rally climbs.\n\nSharma said it would take a meaningful beat on the US inflation data to accelerate the pace of the dollar-yen's rise. He sees the currency pair's downside being limited to around 152 by onshore demand for the greenback from retail investors and importers with real dollar needs.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Kanda underlined the importance of stability aligned with economic fundamentals in currency markets. He stated that while government intervention is not necessary when markets are functioning smoothly, it may be required in cases of excessive speculation-induced volatility.\n\nRecent suspicions suggest Japan may have intervened in the market to boost the yen's value after it plummeted to levels not seen in over three decades. Data from the Bank of Japan indicates substantial spending, amounting to over 9 trillion yen, in defence of the currency. Such interventions contributed to a notable rebound in the yen's value from its recent low against the dollar.\n\nKanda refrained from confirming or denying speculation about market interventions, in line with customary practice among currency authorities. While a weaker yen benefits Japanese exporters, it presents challenges for policymakers, including increased import costs, inflationary pressures, and household budget constraints.\n\nFurthermore, Kanda highlighted widespread concerns about foreign exchange market volatility expressed by several countries during a meeting preceding the ASEAN+3 finance ministers and central bank governors conference in Tbilisi, Georgia. This collective apprehension underscores the broader impact of currency fluctuations beyond Japan, reflecting the shared interests of ASEAN members and East Asian partners in maintaining market stability.\n\n(With Reuters inputs)", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "republic_world_digital@republicworld.com", "name": "Republic World Digital", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_interventionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic interventionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ASEAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tbilisi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tbilisi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Internet_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Internet Marketing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Associations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Local_Currency_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Local Currency Systems", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/screenshot2024-05-02082443-171461853384316_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545418", "eventUri": "eng-9545418", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 102, "relevance": 1}

Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Fed Governor Michelle will make appearances later this week as well.\n\nThe euro exchanged hands 0.1% higher at $1.0769. The European Central Bank is widely tipped to roll out its own rate cut in June, although it remains uncertain what will happen with monetary policy after the meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, the British pound traded 0.2% higher at $1.2573. Data last week showed that the U.K.'s key services sector remains in a healthy state, possibly granting the Bank of England more room to delay rate reductions.\n\nBroader Asian currencies retreated after recently gaining some ground against the dollar. But the prospect of U.S. borrowing costs remaining elevated in the near-term kept most regional currencies trading negative for the year.\n\nElsewhere, the Australian dollar's AUDUSD pair climbed 0.3%, coming close to two-month highs as traders positioned for a Reserve Bank of Australia meeting on Tuesday. While the RBA is expected to keep rates unchanged, it is also expected to strike a hawkish chord after a stronger-than-expected inflation reading for the first quarter.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Dollar_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Dollar Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Barkin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Barkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austan_Goolsbee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austan Goolsbee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neel_Kashkari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neel Kashkari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Chicago", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Richmond, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEIAE024_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545418", "eventUri": "eng-9545418", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 95, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, monetary officials stashed $362 billion at the Fed's reverse repurchase agreement facility, up from $360 billion a week earlier, according to the latest data from the central bank.\n\nThe figures showing the cash drain cover a week that included at least another instance where Japanese policymakers likely intervened in foreign-exchange markets to support the yen, which is the weakest Group-of-10 currency this year versus a broadly strengthening dollar.\n\nOn April 29, a holiday in Japan, the yen fell to a fresh 34-year low of 160.17 per dollar before sharply rebounding in thin trading. Following the conclusion of the Fed's two-day policy meeting three days later, the yen abruptly rallied more than 3% in the waning hours of the US trading day.\n\nLast week, data from the prior reporting period showed a $17.8 billion drop in balances in a separate cash account used by central bankers, suggesting these funds may have been tapped to prop up the currency at some point.\n\nHowever, historically, Japanese authorities haven't stockpiled their intervention resources at the Fed's non-interest-bearing foreign official deposits category, according to Wrightson ICAP. That points to the possibility that the latest drop in foreign central bank Treasury holdings may have also been used in efforts to support the yen.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has refrained from confirming interventions, but a Bloomberg analysis of Bank of Japan accounts suggest interventions took place. The estimates indicate that policymakers likely spent some \u00a59 trillion last week, or nearly $60 billion at current exchange rates, to bolster the currency -- an amount on par with previous interventions that last took place in the fall of 2022.\n\nJapan's foreign currency reserves were worth about $1.14 trillion at the end of April, falling by $14.2 billion from the previous month, according to the latest data from the country's Ministry of Finance. That was driven by a drop in foreign securities, which declined by about $17 billion to $978 billion.

Meanwhile, the attention on Japan's big interest rate disparity helped the dollar gain momentum against the yen.\n\nIn the face of the Japanese yen, the dollar steadily rebounded after experiencing a decline of more than three percent in the previous week, which was its largest weekly percentage reduction since the beginning of December 2022.\n\nAs a result of the release of the Bank of Japan's summary of ideas from its meeting in April, which revealed that many board members acknowledged the need to raise interest rates and eventually reduce the bank's asset purchases, the yen experienced a little increase in the morning hours of the Asian trading session.\n\nThe move was rather short, and it was evident that the market was gloomy about the currency.\n\nThe markets are betting on two rate cuts this year as a result of the Fed policy meeting that took place this week and the unexpected decrease in job growth in the United States. On the other hand, there is still a significant gap between the extremely low yields of Japan and those of the United States.\n\nThe unexpected reversal by the Federal Reserve is not causing the market to be very anxious. It has been determined by Masafumi Yamamoto, who is the chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities, that the market environment for the dollar/yen is favorable for the upward movement.\n\nTraders are concerned about the possibility of Tokyo intervening in the currency market, which might lead to some sudden \"nervous moves\" when the value of the dollar increases, according to him. This would most likely keep the dollar/yen exchange rate stuck in the range of 155-160 levels.\n\nA statement made by Masato Kanda, the senior currency diplomat for Japan, on Thursday emphasized that the Japanese government is ready to intervene in the currency market.\n\nAs in the next week, the focus will move to the consumer price index (CPI) and the producer pricing index (PPI) for the month of April in the United States. Market participants will be on the lookout for indications that inflation has resumed its downward trend toward the 2% target that the Federal Reserve has set.\n\nIt was announced overnight by Susan Collins, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, that the economy of the United States needs to slow down in order to bring inflation back to the levels that were desired.\n\nWhile the dollar index rose by 0.05% to 105.55 during the same time period. Prior to the policy decision that will be made by the Bank of England later on Thursday, the pound sterling dropped by 0.07% to $1.2487.\n\nAt the same time as inflation is falling, the Bank of England is getting ready to take another step toward lowering interest rates for the first time in around four years.\n\nAt a time when the European Central Bank has already suggested that it will decrease borrowing prices, the most significant concern for investors is whether or not the Bank of England (BOE) signals a decline in June.", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Japan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizuho_Financial_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mizuho Financial Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Susan Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Japan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Paper Money", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dollar.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545418", "eventUri": "eng-9545418", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 452988524, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 131, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 131}}}

Circuit said all of Bannon's challenges lack merit.\n\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nBannon's lawyer at trial argued that the charges were politically motivated and that the former adviser didn't ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\n\nThe defense has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Trump has asserted executive privilege.\n\nDefense lawyer David Schoen told the judge the defense had planned to ask the full U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, if necessary, to review the matter. Schoen said it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his sentence before those rulings could be handed down.\n\n\"That might serve a political agenda; but it would be a grave injustice,\" Schoen wrote in court papers.\n\nA second Trump aide, trade advisor Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress and reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence.\n\nNavarro had maintained that he couldn't cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. But courts have rejected that argument, finding Navarro couldn't prove Trump had actually invoked it.\n\nThe House Jan. 6 committee's final report asserted that Trump criminally engaged in a \"multi-part conspiracy\" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection two years ago.", "source": {"uri": "mor-tv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MOR-TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deposition (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_District_of_Columbia_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Schoen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Schoen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive privilege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/steve-bannon-oct-19-1634658323.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.846xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628688", "eventUri": "eng-9628688", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 89, "textEnd": 95, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 974, "textEnd": 980, "freq": 4}], "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Peter Navarro, a former trade adviser, is currently serving a four-month term.\n\nBannon was allowed to avoid serving the sentence during his appeal. Prosecutors moved to end that reprieve after a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rebuffed Bannon's challenge to his conviction.\n\nBannon's lawyers urged Nichols to keep Bannon free, arguing he can still appeal to the full D.C. Circuit court or the U.S. Supreme Court. Bannon has argued that he was advised by his lawyer that he did not have to comply with the subpoena and therefore did not intend to commit a crime.\n\nBannon, who no longer worked in the White House at the time, was part of a group of Trump advisers who sought to derail formal certification of Biden's victory in the 2020 election.\n\nThe congressional panel said he may have had knowledge of events planned for Jan. 6, 2021, when a group of Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a failed bid to stop lawmakers from certifying the vote.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Goudsward;

The Washington Examiner reached out to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office for comment.\n\nLast week, Trump was found guilty after being charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal an alleged second crime that he had already committed. According to Jed Rubenfield, a professor of law at Yale University, the state of New York never committed itself to what the second crime was.\n\nRather, it theorized that the crime could have been a New York tax violation, a federal campaign finance violation, or a New York election law violation. During the trial, the prosecution narrowed the \"second crime\" to the third theory. While the New York election law violation is itself a two-part crime, meaning it depends in turn on the violation of another statute, the prosecution never clarified what the underlying statute was.\n\nWhen Trump's lawyers asked for more information about the second crime, Bragg denied it. Judge Juan Merchan upheld the decision, saying it was lawful for the state to have several theories about what the second crime was.\n\nLegal experts say Trump's best case for appeal would be to argue his Sixth Amendment rights under the Constitution were violated. Under the Sixth Amendment, every criminal defendant has the right to know the charges against him.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nBannon does not appear to have attached a Trump comeback to purely legal means. He has instead compared a Trump resurgence to \"the evolution of any war -- the Revolution,\" adding, \"They only get nastier over time.\"\n\nBannon served in the Trump administration for seven months as a chief strategist before Trump reported he \"was fired\" from his role. The former president disavowed his former adviser in 2018, saying, \"Steve doesn't represent my base.\"\n\nAfter leaving the Trump White House, Bannon returned to Breitbart News, a controversial far-right news outlet of which he is the executive chairman.\n\nAfter he refused to comply with the now-defunct House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, Bannon was found in contempt of Congress. Last month, a federal appeals court upheld Bannon's conviction.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBannon could face up to four months in prison for his conviction. According to his attorney, David Schoen, jail time would only strengthen the MAGA base and reinforce the federal government's \"political agenda.\"\n\nThe Washington Examiner reached out to Steve Bannon for comment.\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

The Washington Examiner reached out to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office for comment.\n\nLast week, Trump was found guilty after being charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal an alleged second crime that he had already committed. According to Jed Rubenfield, a professor of law at Yale University, the state of New York never committed itself to what the second crime was.\n\nRather, it theorized that the crime could have been a New York tax violation, a federal campaign finance violation, or a New York election law violation. During the trial, the prosecution narrowed the \"second crime\" to the third theory. While the New York election law violation is itself a two-part crime, meaning it depends in turn on the violation of another statute, the prosecution never clarified what the underlying statute was.\n\nWhen Trump's lawyers asked for more information about the second crime, Bragg denied it. Judge Juan Merchan upheld the decision, saying it was lawful for the state to have several theories about what the second crime was.\n\nLegal experts say Trump's best case for appeal would be to argue his Sixth Amendment rights under the Constitution were violated. Under the Sixth Amendment, every criminal defendant has the right to know the charges against him.\n\nBannon does not appear to have attached a Trump comeback to purely legal means. He has instead compared a Trump resurgence to \"the evolution of any war -- the Revolution,\" adding, \"They only get nastier over time.\"\n\nBannon served in the Trump administration for seven months as a chief strategist before Trump reported he \"was fired\" from his role. The former president disavowed his former adviser in 2018, saying, \"Steve doesn't represent my base.\"\n\nAfter leaving the Trump White House, Bannon returned to Breitbart News, a controversial far-right news outlet of which he is the executive chairman.\n\nAfter he refused to comply with the now-defunct House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, Bannon was found in contempt of Congress. Last month, a federal appeals court upheld Bannon's conviction.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBannon could face up to four months in prison for his conviction. According to his attorney, David Schoen, jail time would only strengthen the MAGA base and reinforce the federal government's \"political agenda.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_hallas@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Emily Hallas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Election law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prevention", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/AP24055848158741.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628688", "eventUri": "eng-9628688", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

But courts have rejected that argument, finding Navarro could not prove Trump had actually invoked it.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appellate_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appellate court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deposition (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_District_of_Columbia_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive privilege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Iterated_Prisoner_Dilemma", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Iterated Prisoner Dilemma", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/07/40708fe7-cafe-4dfa-87ae-ac01ca3de559_4a443cec.jpg?itok=861dsFV2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628688", "eventUri": "eng-9628688", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 239, "textEnd": 245}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1162, "textEnd": 1171}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Peter Navarro, a former trade adviser, is currently serving a four-month term.\n\nBannon was allowed to avoid serving the sentence during his appeal. Prosecutors moved to end that reprieve after a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rebuffed Bannon's challenge to his conviction.\n\nBannon's lawyers urged Nichols to keep Bannon free, arguing he can still appeal to the full D.C. Circuit court or the U.S. Supreme Court. Bannon has argued that he was advised by his lawyer that he did not have to comply with the subpoena and therefore did not intend to commit a crime.\n\nBannon, who no longer worked in the White House at the time, was part of a group of Trump advisers who sought to derail formal certification of Biden's victory in the 2020 election.\n\nThe congressional panel said he may have had knowledge of events planned for Jan. 6, 2021, when a group of Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a failed bid to stop lawmakers from certifying the vote.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Goudsward;

Peter Navarro, a former trade adviser, is currently serving a four-month term.\n\nBannon was allowed to avoid serving the sentence during his appeal. Prosecutors moved to end that reprieve after a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rebuffed Bannon's challenge to his conviction.\n\nBannon's lawyers urged Nichols to keep Bannon free, arguing he can still appeal to the full D.C. Circuit court or the U.S. Supreme Court. Bannon has argued that he was advised by his lawyer that he did not have to comply with the subpoena and therefore did not intend to commit a crime.\n\nBannon, who no longer worked in the White House at the time, was part of a group of Trump advisers who sought to derail formal certification of Biden's victory in the 2020 election.\n\nThe congressional panel said he may have had knowledge of events planned for Jan. 6, 2021, when a group of Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a failed bid to stop lawmakers from certifying the vote.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Goudsward; Editing by Scott Malone and Lisa Shumaker)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

He is also a co-founder and a commissioning editor at Hypatia Press, a publisher that specializes in philosophical works that challenge religion or spirituality.\n\nSteve Bannon, a controversial advisor and ally to Donald Trump, should be in prison right now, yet he's skating by on a razor's edge, a former federal prosecutor said on Sunday.\n\nEx-prosecutor Joyce Vance raised the concern on her Civil Discourse Substack blog. She asked the question, \"Why isn't Bannon in prison to serve his sentence following the Court of Appeals decision to affirm his conviction?\"\n\n\"He's been close before, but then, nothing. Peter Navarro, who was convicted and sentenced for the same crime, has been in custody and is almost done serving his sentence at FCI Miami,\" Vance wrote.\n\nALSO READ: Trump just endorsed this Virginia congressional candidate whose social media isn't so MAGA\n\nShe went on to say that Navarro, another Trump advisor in the former White House administration, \"did not receive a bond to stay out of custody while appealing.\"\n\n\"Bannon did, but he should not have. The legal standard is that a defendant must have a substantial issue that it's likely they will prevail upon,\" Trump wrote. \"Bannon did not -- you recall he failed to show up to testify or turn over any documents at all pursuant to congressional subpoenas. While Bannon gives media interviews and continues to host his podcast, Peter Navarro is in prison, where Bannon should be too.\"\n\nShe continued:\n\n\"Judge Carl Nichols, who oversaw the proceedings against Bannon and granted that appeals bond, happens to be a Trump appointee who clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas. He is the only judge on the District Court in the District of Columbia who ruled the government couldn't use the obstruction statute against January 6 participants, leading to the case currently pending in front of the Supreme Court. Following the decision by a unanimous panel of the D.C. Circuit on May 10, 2024, affirming Bannon's conviction, the government asked Judge Nichols to order Bannon into custody. That should have been routine.\"\n\n\"It was not,\" Vance added. \"The Judge suggested, in an order asking for a response from Bannon, that he might not have the authority to enter the order despite the Court of Appeals decision. Then, he ruled that was the case and declined to enter the order without hearing again from the government.\"\n\nVance goes on to say that it's \"time for Bannon to go to prison.\"\n\n\"The Court of Appeals decision was, as the government characterized it, 'full-throated,' leaving virtually no room to believe the Court of Appeals would hear the case en banc and reverse. This is not the kind of case the Supreme Court takes -- there is no split in the Circuits on the issue Bannon raised about his state of mind,\" she wrote. \"The case is over, and Bannon belongs in prison. The government directed the court to the language in the statute that says it 'shall' take the defendant into custody.\"\n\n\"Will Bannon finally begin his sentence, or will the Judge come up with more excuses?\" the expert added. \"The government's motion suggests it's out of patience. This could become a case for mandamus.

He told reporters outside court: \"I've got great lawyers, and we're going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.\"\n\nMr Nichols, who was nominated to the bench by Mr Trump, a Republican, had initially allowed Bannon to remain free while he fought his conviction.\n\nBut prosecutors urged the judge to revoke his bond after a panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit said all of Bannon's challenges lack merit.\n\nProsecutor John Crabb told the judge it was \"very unlikely\" that the full appeals court or the Supreme Court would throw out Bannon's conviction.\n\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the January 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Mr Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nBannon's lawyer at trial argued that the charges were politically motivated and that the former adviser did not ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\n\nThe defence has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a lawyer for Mr Trump to be in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Mr Trump has asserted executive privilege.\n\nDefence lawyer David Schoen told the judge it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his sentence before he exhausts his appeals.\n\nHe said the case raises \"serious constitutional issues\" that need to be examined by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"In this country, we don't send anyone to prison if they believe that they were doing something that complied with the law,\" Mr Schoen told reporters.\n\nA second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress.

Ex-prosecutor Joyce Vance raised the concern on her Civil Discourse Substack blog. She asked the question, \"Why isn't Bannon in prison to serve his sentence following the Court of Appeals decision to affirm his conviction?\"\n\n\"He's been close before, but then, nothing. Peter Navarro, who was convicted and sentenced for the same crime, has been in custody and is almost done serving his sentence at FCI Miami,\" Vance wrote. She went on to say that Navarro, another Trump advisor in the former White House administration, \"did not receive a bond to stay out of custody while appealing.\"\n\n\"Bannon did, but he should not have. The legal standard is that a defendant must have a substantial issue that it's likely they will prevail upon,\" Trump wrote. \"Bannon did not -- you recall he failed to show up to testify or turn over any documents at all pursuant to congressional subpoenas. While Bannon gives media interviews and continues to host his podcast, Peter Navarro is in prison, where Bannon should be too.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Judge Carl Nichols, who oversaw the proceedings against Bannon and granted that appeals bond, happens to be a Trump appointee who clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas. He is the only judge on the District Court in the District of Columbia who ruled the government couldn't use the obstruction statute against January 6 participants, leading to the case currently pending in front of the Supreme Court. Following the decision by a unanimous panel of the D.C. Circuit on May 10, 2024, affirming Bannon's conviction, the government asked Judge Nichols to order Bannon into custody.

He was sentenced to four months in prison.\n\nThe federal judge presiding over the case, Carl Nichols, had initially paused the sentence while Bannon appealed the conviction.\n\nLast month, however, a DC Circuit Court of Appeals panel unanimously rejected several challenges Bannon made to the case, and prosecutors immediately asked Nichols to send Bannon to prison to begin serving his sentence.\n\nNichols said Thursday that, given the appeals court ruling, he did not believe the basis he had for pausing Bannon's sentence \"exists any longer.\"\n\nThe judge, who was appointed by Trump, said that he concluded that he had the authority to lift the hold on Bannon's sentence, even as an appeal of conviction will continue.\n\nShortly after the hearing concluded, Bannon vowed to fight his contempt of Congress conviction \"all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.\"\n\nBannon also claimed without evidence that his prosecution by the Justice Department was about \"shutting down the MAGA movement, shutting down grassroots conservatives, shutting down President Trump.\"\n\n\"There's nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up. There's not a prison built or a jail built that will ever shut me up,\" he told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Washington.\n\nAt the hearing, Bannon's attorney, David Schoen, argued that his client should be able to remain out of prison until the Supreme Court had a chance to weigh in on the case. Schoen also said that his request for the full DC Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case would be filed by June 24.\n\nProsecutor John Crabb said that Bannon had not satisfied the legal threshold for staying out of prison while his appeal continued. Crabb pointed to the failed effort by Peter Navarro, another ex-Trump adviser prosecuted for refusing to comply with a House January 6 committee subpoena, to pause his sentenced -- an effort that was rebuffed by the DC Circuit and the Supreme Court.\n\nNichols said Navarro's case presented different issues, and the judge ultimately pointed to the fact that three appeals court judges \"wholeheartedly\" rejected the arguments Bannon was making in his case. Nichols noted that a member of the DC Circuit panel considering Bannon's case could have noted in a concurrence or dissent that they had concerns about the key precedent Bannon is seeking to overturn in his case, but no judge on the panel wrote such a statement.\n\nWith a little less than a month until the surrender date, Bannon could try to file emergency motions with the appeals court and even the Supreme Court seeking to push off his sentence longer.\n\nAfter Nichols announced his order, Schoen tried again to convince Nichols to let Bannon stay out of prison, in an exchange with the judge that got heated.\n\nNavarro is currently serving a four-month prison sentence for his 2023 conviction.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He was sentenced to four months in prison.\n\nThe federal judge presiding over the case, Carl Nichols, had initially paused the sentence while Bannon appealed the conviction.\n\nLast month, however, a DC Circuit Court of Appeals panel unanimously rejected several challenges Bannon made to the case, and prosecutors immediately asked Nichols to send Bannon to prison to begin serving his sentence.\n\nNichols said Thursday that, given the appeals court ruling, he did not believe the basis he had for pausing Bannon's sentence \"exists any longer.\"\n\nThe judge, who was appointed by Trump, said that he concluded that he had the authority to lift the hold on Bannon's sentence, even as an appeal of conviction will continue.\n\nPotential high court intervention\n\nShortly after the hearing concluded, Bannon vowed to fight his contempt of Congress conviction \"all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.\"\n\nBannon also claimed without evidence that his prosecution by the Justice Department was about \"shutting down the MAGA movement, shutting down grassroots conservatives, shutting down President Trump.\"\n\n\"There's nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up. There's not a prison built or a jail built that will ever shut me up,\" he told reporters outside the federal courthouse in Washington.\n\n\"We're going to win at the Supreme Court,\" he added.\n\nSecond ex-Trump adviser punished over subpoena non-compliance\n\nAt the hearing, Bannon's attorney, David Schoen, argued that his client should be able to remain out of prison until the Supreme Court had a chance to weigh in on the case. Schoen also said that his request for the full DC Circuit Court of Appeals to review the case would be filed by June 24.\n\nProsecutor John Crabb said that Bannon had not satisfied the legal threshold for staying out of prison while his appeal continued. Crabb pointed to the failed effort by Peter Navarro, another ex-Trump adviser prosecuted for refusing to comply with a House January 6 committee subpoena, to pause his sentenced -- an effort that was rebuffed by the DC Circuit and the Supreme Court.\n\nNichols said Navarro's case presented different issues, and the judge ultimately pointed to the fact that three appeals court judges \"wholeheartedly\" rejected the arguments Bannon was making in his case. Nichols noted that a member of the DC Circuit panel considering Bannon's case could have noted in a concurrence or dissent that they had concerns about the key precedent Bannon is seeking to overturn in his case, but no judge on the panel wrote such a statement.\n\nWith a little less than a month until the surrender date, Bannon could try to file emergency motions with the appeals court and even the Supreme Court seeking to push off his sentence longer.\n\nAfter Nichols announced his order, Schoen tried again to convince Nichols to let Bannon stay out of prison, in an exchange with the judge that got heated.\n\nNavarro is currently serving a four-month prison sentence for his 2023 conviction.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

But Nichols also made clear in his ruling that Bannon could seek a stay of his order, which could delay his surrender date.\n\nAlso Read | Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky Dials PM Narendra Modi, Congratulates Him on Lok Sabha Elections Win; Says 'Ukraine Relies on India's Participation in Global Peace Summit'.\n\nNichols, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, a Republican, had initially allowed Bannon to remain free while he fought his conviction. But the panel of the US Court of Appeals for the D C Circuit said all of Bannon's challenges lack merit.\n\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nAlso Read | Michael Mosley Missing Case: Greek Authorities Launch Rescue Operation for Missing British Doctor Who Popularised Intermittent Fasting for Weight Loss.\n\nBannon's lawyer at trial argued that the charges were politically motivated and that the former adviser didn't ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\n\nThe defence has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Trump has asserted executive privilege.\n\nDefence lawyer David Schoen told the judge the defense had planned to ask the full US Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, if necessary, to review the matter. Schoen said it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his sentence before those rulings could be handed down.\n\n\"That might serve a political agenda; but it would be a grave injustice,\" Schoen wrote in court papers.\n\nA second Trump aide, trade advisor Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress and reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence.\n\nNavarro had maintained that he couldn't cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. But courts have rejected that argument, finding Navarro couldn't prove Trump had actually invoked it.\n\nThe House Jan. 6 committee's final report asserted that Trump criminally engaged in a \"multi-part conspiracy\" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection two years ago.

A federal appeals court has upheld the criminal conviction of Donald Trump's longtime ally for defying a subpoena from the House committee investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol. A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on Friday, May 10, rejected Bannon's challenges to his contempt of Congress conviction. Steven Hirsch/New York Post via Associated Press file\n\nWASHINGTON -- Steve Bannon, a longtime ally of former President Donald Trump, must report to prison by July 1 to serve his four-month sentence for defying a subpoena from the House committee that investigated the attack on the U.S. Capitol, a federal judge ruled Thursday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington granted prosecutors' request to make Bannon begin serving his prison term after a three-judge panel of a federal appeals court last month upheld his contempt of Congress conviction. But Nichols also made clear on Thursday in his ruling that Bannon could seek a stay of his order, which could delay his surrender date.\n\nNichols, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, had initially allowed Bannon to remain free while he fought his conviction. But the panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said all of Bannon's challenges lack merit.\n\nRelated Steve Bannon convicted of contempt for defying Jan. 6 panel\n\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBannon's lawyer at trial argued the charges were politically motivated and that the former adviser didn't ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\n\nThe defense has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room, and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Trump has asserted executive privilege.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDefense lawyer David Schoen told the judge they had planned to ask the full U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, if necessary, to review the matter. Schoen said it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his sentence before those rulings could be handed down.\n\n\"That might serve a political agenda; but it would be a grave injustice,\" Schoen wrote in court papers.\n\nA second Trump aide, trade advisor Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress and reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence.\n\nNavarro had maintained that he couldn't cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. But courts have rejected that argument, finding Navarro couldn't prove Trump had actually invoked it.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Steve Bannon convicted of contempt for defying Jan. 6 panel\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)\n\nA former adviser to ex-President Donald Trump was ordered on June 6 to surrender to prison by July 1 to serve a four-month sentence he received after being convicted of contempt of Congress.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in federal court in Washington on Thursday granted prosecutors' request to make Mr. Bannon, 70, start serving his prison term after a three-judge panel of a federal appeals court recently upheld his conviction.\n\nBut Judge Nichols, an appointee of President Trump, also said Mr. Bannon could seek a stay of his order. If a stay is granted, that could delay the surrender date.\n\nOutside the courthouse, Mr. Bannon told reporters: \"I've got great lawyers, and we're going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.\"\n\nHe also said that prosecutors would \"not shut up Bannon, and they're certainly not going to shut up MAGA,\" or the Make America Great Again movement.\n\nMr. Bannon briefly worked for the White House during the early days of the Trump administration but departed in the fall of 2017. He transitioned to hosting a program called \"War Room.\"\n\nJudge Nichols previously sentenced Mr. Bannon to time in prison for violating a federal law called section 192 that prohibits defying congressional subpoenas, but allowed Mr. Bannon to remain free while he fought his conviction. He said that Mr. Bannon's appeal \"raises a substantial question of law that is likely to result in a reversal or an order for a new trial.\"\n\nA U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit panel in May then rejected Mr. Bannon's arguments that he was wrongly convicted. The arguments centered in part on how Mr. Bannon was relying on advice from counsel when he defied a subpoena from a U.S. House of Representatives panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, breach of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe appeals court \"has squarely held that 'willfully' in Section 192 means only that the defendant deliberately and intentionally refused to comply with a congressional subpoena, and that this exact 'advice of counsel' defense is no defense at all,\" U.S. Circuit Judge Bradley Garcia, an appointee of President Joe Biden, wrote for the panel.\n\nProsecutors then asked Judge Nichols to force Mr. Bannon to begin serving his sentence, in light of the ruling.\n\n\"There is no longer a 'substantial question of law that is likely to result in a reversal or an order for a new trial,'\" prosecutors said.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Bannon urged Judge Nichols to deny the prosecutorial request. They said they plan to ask the full U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary, to review the matter and argued it would be unfair to send Mr. Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his sentence before those rulings could be handed down.\n\n\"That might serve a political agenda; but it would be a grave injustice,\" the lawyers said.\n\nDavid Schoen, one of the lawyers, told reporters after Thursday's hearing that the fundamental principle of law to be considered by the Supreme Court is how \"willfully in the criminal context means that you knew you did something wrong.\"\n\nSection 192 opens up any person who is subpoenaed by Congress and \"willfully makes default or who, having appeared, refuses to answer any question pertinent to the question under inquiry\" to be found guilty and sentenced to up to one year in prison.\n\n\"The unequivocal evidence in this case, without any dispute, is that Mr. Bannon never got the subpoena. His lawyer got the subpoena, and his lawyer told him an executive privilege has been invoked. President Trump confirmed that and his lawyer told him that when executive privilege has been invoked, you may not, as a matter of law, comply with this subpoena,\" Mr. Schoen said.\n\nMr. Bannon offered to testify once the committee worked out the privilege matter with President Trump but the committee opted to turn to the courts instead.\n\nA second former aide to President Trump, Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress because he would not cooperate with the Jan. 6 committee.\n\nMr. Navarro had maintained that he couldn't cooperate with the committee because President Trump had invoked executive privilege, but courts rejected that argument, finding Mr. Navarro couldn't prove President Trump had actually invoked it.\n\nMr. Navarro's bid to stay out of prison as he appealed his conviction was turned down by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta, an appointee of former President Barack Obama. The judge's order was upheld by the appeals court and the Supreme Court, resulting in Mr. Navarro beginning his four-month sentence in March.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news",

But on Thursday, Nichols ruled that the original reasons for the postponement no longer apply because a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled strongly and unanimously last month against Bannon's position.\n\nBannon intends to continue appealing the case to the full bench of the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court. But unless one of those courts steps in to block Nichols' decision, Bannon is unlikely to be able to stave off prison in the meantime.\n\nBannon was convicted in July 2022 of two misdemeanor counts of contempt of Congress for stonewalling a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\n\"I do not believe that the original basis for my stay of Mr. Bannon's sentence exists anymore,\" Nichols said from the bench of the federal district courthouse in Washington, D.C.\n\nBannon was flanked by his lawyers David Schoen -- who once represented Trump in his impeachment proceedings after Jan. 6 -- and Evan Corcoran, who is a key witness in the criminal case against Trump in Florida, where Trump is accused of hoarding classified documents after he left the White House.\n\nBannon is the second former Trump White House adviser headed to prison for defying the Jan. 6 committee. Peter Navarro, a former Trump trade adviser, is currently serving a four-month sentence in Miami for blowing off a subpoena from the panel. The appeals court's rejection of Navarro's bid to stay out of jail was a key factor in Nichols' decision to revoke Bannon's bail.\n\nNichols also said his decision was based on the appeals court's full-throated ruling in Bannon's own case, which sharply rejected the key issues that Nichols once said might cause the appeals court to revisit the conviction.\n\n\"We're going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to,\" Bannon said after Nichols' decision. \"There's not a prison built or jail built that will shut me up.\"\n\nSchoen called on Speaker Mike Johnson to formally declare

The appeals court upheld Bannon's conviction in May, and federal prosecutors soon filed a motion asking U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols to order Bannon to report to prison. Federal prosecutors told Nichols there was \"no legal basis\" for the continued stay of the sentence after the federal appeals court rejected the appeal.\n\nBannon smiled as he went through security to enter the courthouse Thursday morning.

He's the judge who rejected the government's use of an obstruction of an official proceeding charge, which has been used against hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants, as well as Trump himself. That case ultimately bubbled up to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on the use of the statute in April. On Wednesday, Nichols sentenced a Jan. 6 defendant who assaulted law enforcement officers with bear spray -- and who was caught thanks to a sting operation that a woman launched on the dating app Bumble -- to more than six years in federal prison.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistant United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closing argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sting operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240603-Steve-Bannon-al-1205-8d776b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628688", "eventUri": "eng-9628688", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 187, "textEnd": 193, "freq": 5}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 1736, "textEnd": 1743}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The congressional investigators were interested in Bannon's conduct in over a dozen key areas, including his communications with former President Donald Trump as he resisted the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAt the time, Bannon contended he did not comply because of executive privilege concerns raised by Trump and said that his former attorney had advised him not to respond to the subpoena because of the potential privilege.\n\nJudge Carl Nichols ordered before trial that Bannon could not tell the jury about the advice of counsel defense because of binding legal precedent. After his conviction, the judge, Carl Nichols, sentenced Bannon to four months in prison but held off on actually imposing the ruling, ruling it was \"likely\" the conviction would be overturned.\n\nBannon's defense subsequently appealed the conviction.\n\nLast month, an appeals court disagreed with his arguments and ruled Bannon's \"'advice of counsel' defense is no defense at all.\" The three-judge panel in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the jury's conviction and wrote the defense he sought was \"unavailable under this statute.\"\n\n\"Nothing in the authorities Bannon relies upon calls into question this court's longstanding interpretation of 'willfully' ... as requiring a deliberate, intentional failure to respond to a subpoena,\" the judges wrote last month in their opinion.\n\nStill, the panel ordered its ruling would not go into effect until seven days after Bannon pursued a further appeal, leaving an opportunity for another court to again push off the prison sentence.\n\nBut the Justice Department took the case back to Nichols' court and asked the judge to lift the stay on Bannon's four-month prison sentence. Prosecutors argued there was no longer a \"substantial question of law\" because the conviction was upheld.\n\nIn a previous order, Judge Nichols indicated his main focus at Thursday's hearing will be whether he has the legal authority to move forward.\n\n\"The defendant's argument that the Court lacks jurisdiction to lift the stay of sentence pending issuance of the mandate is unavailing. He all but concedes there is not a single case in support of his position,\" prosecutors wrote.\n\nBannon's defense team, however, pushed back, writing Nichols \"lacks the authority\" to send Bannon to prison as the appeals court panel opted to without the mandate of its ruling. And even if the judge decided he did have the authority, Bannon's team wrote, Nichols should still hold off in sending Bannon to prison because, \"The harm caused truly would be irreparable and unjust if the judgment, already fully executed, is then reversed on further review.\"\n\n\"There is no basis for considering the removal of the stay of the sentence pending appeal until the appeals process has fully run its course,\" wrote attorney David Schoen.\n\nSchoen contended in a statement to CBS News that, \"This case raises vitally important constitutional issues directly implicating the separation of powers\" that should be considered by the full D.C. Court of Appeals and \"ultimately the Supreme Court.\" He also alleged the appeals court \"ignored a half-century of jurisprudence\" in issuing a ruling that he will push to be reversed.\n\nBannon is not the only Trump White House official convicted for defying a subpoena from the House Jan. 6 committee. Former trade advisor Peter Navarro is currently serving a four-month prison sentence after a jury in Washington, D.C. found him guilty of contempt.\n\nLike Bannon, Navarro is appealing his conviction, but the judge overseeing his case opted not to delay the imposition of the prison term, a decision that has been upheld by higher courts.\n\nBannon was not in the White House during the final months of the Trump administration that were of interest to the Jan. 6 committee, but he has continued to exert influence within the former president's political base. Following Trump's conviction on New York State charges last week, Bannon had advocated for retribution should Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, retake the White House.",

Circuit said all of Bannon's challenges lack merit. Prosecutor John Crabb told the judge it was \"very unlikely\" that the full appeals court or the Supreme Court would throw out Bannon's conviction.\n\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBannon's lawyer at trial argued that the charges were politically motivated and that the former adviser didn't ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\n\nThe defense has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Trump has asserted executive privilege.\n\nDefense lawyer David Schoen told the judge it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his sentence before he exhausts his appeals. He said the case raises \"serious constitutional issues\" that need to be examined by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"In this country, we don't send anyone to prison if they believe that they were doing something that complied with the law,\" Schoen told reporters.\n\nA second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress. He reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence.\n\nNavarro, too, had maintained that he couldn't cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege.

U.S. District Judge Carl said Thursday he did not believe that the \"original basis\" for his stay of the imposition of Bannon's sentence existed any longer after an appeals court upheld Bannon's conviction. Bannon could still appeal Nichol's ruling that he must report to prison.Bannon was sentenced more than a year and a half ago, in October 2022, to four months behind bars, the same sentence currently being served by former Trump adviser Peter Navarro, who also refused to comply with a Jan. 6 Committee subpoena.\n\nDonald Trump\"The defendant chose allegiance to Donald Trump over compliance with the law,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Molly Gaston, who now serves on special counsel Jack Smith's team, told jurors during closing arguments in 2022.Bannon's sentence was put on hold pending appeal, and his lawyers made their case to a three-judge federal appeals court panel in November. The appeals court upheld Bannon's conviction in May, and federal prosecutors soon filed a motion asking Nichols to order Bannon to report to prison. Federal prosecutors told Nichols there was \"no legal basis\" for the continued stay of the sentence after the federal appeals court rejected the appeal.Bannon's lawyers argued that the sentence should be stayed until they appeal it to the full appeals court and the Supreme Court. Any delay, of course, would benefit Bannon if Trump is elected president in November and decides -- just as he did on the last day of his presidency on Jan. 20, 2021 -- to pardon Bannon on federal criminal charges.Bannon smiled as he went through security to enter the courthouse Thursday morning. A person nearby said \"Trump '24!\" to him and Bannon smiled and shook his hand.\n\nFollowing the judge's decision, he looked calm and stayed smiling. Bannon's lawyer, David Schoen, sprung into action, becoming much more passionate than he'd been during the rest of the hearing.\n\nJudge Nichols told him: \"One thing you have to learn as a lawyer is that when the judge has made his decision, you don't stand up and start yelling,\" adding through Schoen's protests: \"I've had enough.\"\n\n\"I'm not yelling,\" Schoen retorted, saying he was \"passionate.\"\n\n\"You're sending a man to prison who thought he was complying with the law, we don't do that in my system,\" Schoen said, calling the decision \"contrary to our system of justice.\"\n\n\"I think you should sit down,\" Nichols responded. Nichols, a Trump appointee, has overseen a number of Jan. 6 cases. He's the judge who rejected the government's use of an obstruction of an official proceeding charge, which has been used against hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants, as well as Trump himself. That case ultimately bubbled up to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments on the use of the statute in April. On Wednesday, Nichols sentenced a Jan. 6 defendant who assaulted law enforcement officers with bear spray -- and who was caught thanks to a sting operation that a woman launched on the dating app Bumble -- to more than six years in federal prison.", "source": {"uri": "yalibnan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ya Libnan"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistant United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Schoen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Schoen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sting operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628688", "eventUri": "eng-9628688", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 107, "textEnd": 113}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 183, "textEnd": 189, "freq": 5}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 1890, "textEnd": 1897}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

When that effort failed, Bannon faced the genuine possibility of incarceration.\n\nThat now appears increasingly unavoidable. NBC News reported:\n\nFor those who might need a refresher as to how we arrived at this point, the one thing everyone involved in the process can agree on is that Bannon has important insights related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. He was in communications with Trump in the run-up to the insurrectionist riot, and he reportedly told the outgoing president, \"[I]t's time to kill the Biden presidency in the crib.\"\n\nThe day before the attack, Bannon seemed to know quite a bit about what was likely to happen, telling his podcast listeners, \"All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. Just understand this: All hell is going to break loose tomorrow.... [A]ll I can say is: Strap in. You have made this happen, and tomorrow it's game day.\"\n\nWith this in mind, it hardly came as a surprise that the bipartisan House committee investigating the attack issued subpoenas in September 2021, seeking information from key Trump insiders -- and Bannon was at the top of the list.\n\nWhen he refused to comply in any way, the House approved a resolution finding the GOP operative in contempt of Congress. As part of the same process, the Democratic-led chamber referred the matter to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution. In November 2021, Bannon was indicted by a federal grand jury, charged with one count of contempt and another involving his refusal to produce documents despite a congressional subpoena.\n\nThe criminal trial didn't go especially well for the defendant: Bannon's defense team called no witnesses, and the accused never took the stand. The jury only deliberated for about three hours before finding him guilty.\n\nA few months later, U.S. District Court Judge Carl J. Nichols -- also appointed by Trump -- sentenced Bannon to four months behind bars, though the jurist said he could remain free while the appeals process continued.\n\nAs my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim explained in May, when a federal appeals court upheld Bannon's conviction, he was left with few options.\n\nFederal prosecutors told Nichols there was \"no legal basis\" for the continued stay. The jurist agreed and ordered Bannon to report to prison next month.\n\nThe podcast host and his defense counsel will almost certainly continue to pursue appeals, though it appears increasingly inevitable that Bannon will soon be behind bars.\n\nComplicating matters, Bannon is also slated to stand trial in New York City in September on charges related to his role in the \"We Build the Wall\" operation. In that case, he's accused of helping defraud donors. (Coincidentally, Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over Donald Trump's hush money trial, is overseeing Bannon's other case, too.)\n\nBannon also faced federal criminal charges four years ago, though he received a pardon from Trump on the former president's last day in office.\n\nAnother presidential pardon this year appears extremely unlikely.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand juries in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Build_the_Wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "We Build the Wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_J._Nichols", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl J.

Bob Good, R-5th, Friday evening in Powhatan County, according to Good's campaign website. Good faces a Feb. 18 primary challenge from state Sen. John McGuire, R-Goochland. Former Rep. Dave Brat, R-7th, also is scheduled to campaign with Good in Powhatan.\n\nNichols, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, a Republican, had initially allowed Bannon to remain free while he fought his conviction. But the panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said all of Bannon's challenges lack merit.\n\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nBannon's lawyer at trial argued that the charges were politically motivated and that the former adviser didn't ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\n\nThe defense has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Trump has asserted executive privilege.\n\nDefense lawyer David Schoen told the judge the defense had planned to ask the full U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, if necessary, to review the matter. Schoen said it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his sentence before those rulings could be handed down.\n\n\"That might serve a political agenda; but it would be a grave injustice,\" Schoen wrote in court papers.\n\nLocal News Richmond bookstore owner says he called police after woman confronted Steve Bannon in his shop By TIM DODSON Richmond Times-Dispatch\n\nA second Trump aide, trade advisor Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress and reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence.\n\nNavarro had maintained that he couldn't cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. But courts have rejected that argument, finding Navarro couldn't prove Trump had actually invoked it.\n\nThe House Jan. 6 committee's final report asserted that Trump criminally engaged in a \"multi-part conspiracy\" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection two years ago.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

US District Judge Carl Nichols revoked his bail at a court hearing Thursday and ordered him to report to prison by July 1.\n\nA defiant Bannon addressed reporters outside the Washington courthouse after the judge's order, saying \"there's nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up.\"\n\n\"There's not a prison built or a jail built that will ever shut me up,\" he said.\n\n\"We're going to win on November 5th in an amazing landslide,\" he added in a reference to the date of the White House election expected to be a rematch between Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden.\n\nAnother top Trump advisor, Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress and began serving a four-month sentence in a Florida prison in March.\n\nNavarro, 74, is the highest-ranking former member of the Trump administration to spend time behind bars for actions stemming from the Republican former president's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nBannon served in the White House as chief strategist for the first seven months of Trump's term, leaving reportedly due to conflicts with other top staffers.\n\nIn 2020, he was charged with wire fraud and money laundering for taking for personal use millions of dollars contributed by donors toward the construction of a border wall with Mexico.\n\nWhile others were found guilty in the scheme, Trump issued a blanket pardon to Bannon before leaving office in January 2021, leading to the dismissal of the charges against him.\n\nTrump was scheduled to go on trial in Washington on March 4 on charges of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election won by Biden, but his trial has been put on hold until the US Supreme Court rules on Trump's claim that as a former president he is immune from prosecution.\n\nTrump, 77, was impeached for a second time by the House of Representatives after the Capitol riot -- he was charged with inciting an insurrection -- but was acquitted by the Senate.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon",

He told reporters outside the courthouse: \"I've got great lawyers, and we're going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Circuit said all of Bannon's challenges lack merit. Prosecutor John Crabb told the judge it was \"very unlikely\" that the full appeals court or the Supreme Court would throw out Bannon's conviction.\n\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBannon's lawyer at trial argued that the charges were politically motivated and that the former adviser didn't ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\n\nThe defense has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Trump has asserted executive privilege.\n\nDefense lawyer David Schoen told the judge it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his sentence before he exhausts his appeals. He said the case raises \"serious constitutional issues\" that need to be examined by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"In this country, we don't send anyone to prison if they believe that they were doing something that complied with the law,\" Schoen told reporters.\n\nA second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress. He reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence.\n\nNavarro, too, had maintained that he couldn't cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. But courts have rejected that argument, finding Navarro couldn't prove Trump had actually invoked it.\n\nThe House Jan. 6 committee's final report asserted that Trump criminally engaged in a \"multi-part conspiracy\" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Bannon, a longtime adviser to former President Donald J. Trump, to surrender by July 1 to start serving a four-month prison term imposed on him for disobeying a subpoena to give testimony to the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nBut the judge, Carl J. Nichols, said that Mr. Bannon could delay beginning his sentence if a federal appeals court granted him more time to challenge his conviction.\n\nAfter Mr. Bannon was sentenced in October 2022 on contempt of Congress charges, Judge Nichols allowed him to remain free while he appealed. Last month, Mr. Bannon lost the first round of that challenge as a three-judge panel of a federal appeals court in Washington decided that his guilty verdict on charges of ignoring the House committee's demand for his testimony was proper.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Bannon have promised to ask the full appeals court to reconsider the panel's ruling. Judge Nichols said that Mr. Bannon would have to start serving his sentence in less than four weeks unless the full appeals court takes the case and issues its own ruling to pause the sentence from being enforced.\n\nAnother former aide to Mr. Trump is already serving a prison term for refusing to take part in the House committee's wide-ranging investigation into Mr. Trump's efforts to remain in power after losing the 2020 election.\n\nIn March, Peter Navarro, who once worked as a trade adviser to Mr. Trump, reported to federal prison in Miami to begin serving his own four-month prison stint after a jury found him guilty of contempt of Congress for ignoring one of the committee's subpoenas.\n\nMr. Bannon's legal travails are likely to continue after -- or even during -- his stint in prison.\n\nA few months after he was found guilty of contempt of Congress in Washington, state prosecutors in Manhattan accused him of misusing money he helped raise for a group backing Mr. Trump's border wall. In his final hours in office in 2021, Mr. Trump pardoned Mr. Bannon in a separate federal case that focused on similar accusations.\n\nMr. Bannon's fraud trial is scheduled to take place later this year in the same Manhattan courthouse where Mr. Trump was recently convicted himself on charges of falsifying business records to cover up a sex scandal that threatened his 2016 run for the presidency.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_J._Nichols", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl J.

Soon, the Trump ally was indicted on two federal charges of contempt of Congress, and in July 2022, a jury found Bannon guilty of both counts.\n\nAt sentencing the Justice Department recommended six months in prison and a $200,000 fine, but he was instead sentenced to four months behind bars and a $6,500 fine.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_the_Law_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Above the Law (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_or_special_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Select or special committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Iterated_Prisoner_Dilemma", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Iterated Prisoner Dilemma", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/N8yPk1wDHh.RThXsIhDDYQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/b9b858b6e3375f07b24566cd7bf85e66", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628688", "eventUri": "eng-9628688", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 290, "textEnd": 296}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 776, "textEnd": 782}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1297, "textEnd": 1303}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

When that effort failed, Bannon faced the genuine possibility of incarceration.\n\nThat now appears increasingly unavoidable. NBC News reported:\n\nFor those who might need a refresher as to how we arrived at this point, the one thing everyone involved in the process can agree on is that Bannon has important insights related to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. He was in communications with Trump in the runup to the insurrectionist riot, and he reportedly told the outgoing president, \"[I]t's time to kill the Biden presidency in the crib.\"\n\nThe day before the attack, Bannon seemed to know quite a bit about what was likely to happen, telling his podcast listeners, \"All hell is going to break loose tomorrow. Just understand this: All hell is going to break loose tomorrow.... [A]ll I can say is: Strap in. You have made this happen, and tomorrow it's game day.\"\n\nWith this in mind, it hardly came as a surprise that the bipartisan House committee investigating the attack issued subpoenas in September 2021, seeking information from key Trump insiders -- and Bannon was at the top of the list.\n\nWhen he refused to comply in any way, the House approved a resolution finding the GOP operative in contempt of Congress. As part of the same process, the Democratic-led chamber referred the matter to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution. In November 2021, Bannon was indicted by a federal grand jury, charged with one count of contempt and another involving his refusal to produce documents despite a congressional subpoena.\n\nThe criminal trial didn't go especially well for the defendant: Bannon's defense team called no witnesses, and the accused never took the stand. The jury only deliberated for about three hours before finding him guilty.\n\nA few months later, a federal judge -- who was also appointed by Trump -- sentenced Bannon to four months behind bars, though the jurist said he could remain free while the appeals process continued.\n\nAs my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim explained in May, a federal appeals court upheld Bannon's conviction, leaving him with few options.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand juries in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240606-steve-bannon-al-1226-1645c7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628688", "eventUri": "eng-9628688", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 117, "textEnd": 123}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 642, "textEnd": 648}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)\n\nFormer Trump White House senior strategist Steve Bannon has been ordered by a federal judge in Washington, D.C. to surrender to federal prison by July 1.\n\nAt a Thursday morning hearing before U.S. District Judge Carl J. Nichols, who was appointed by Donald Trump in 2019, the defendant's bail was revoked after a lengthy, and ultimately unsuccessful, effort to reverse his two convictions on contempt of Congress charges.\n\nAs Law&Crime previously reported, prosecutors asked the court to lift a stay of Bannon's four-month sentence roughly two weeks ago after his appeal was rejected by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThat request came by way of a May 14 motion to lift the stay of sentence pending appeal filed in the D.C. District Court.\n\nNichols, sitting in the Elijah Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse at 333 Constitution Ave. NW, obliged the government's request.\n\nDepending on when Bannon finally reports to prison, his sentence could see him remain behind bars until a week before Election Day -- which will be held on Nov. 5, 2024. Should he report to prison ahead of the deadline, however, the defendant would likely be out by early October instead.\n\nIn revoking Bannon's bail, Nichols said the original reasons for staying the sentence were no longer applicable due to the appeals process having played out to the extent it was likely to bear fruit.\n\nBannon was convicted by a jury in July 2022 on two counts of the contempt charge, for defying a subpoena for documents and a deposition. The jury took less than three hours to deliberate. Before trial, Nichols had barred Bannon's anticipated defenses at trial, largely finding them irrelevant to the charged crimes.\n\nBannon was sentenced in October 2022 for his failure to comply with those subpoenas issued by the since-defunct House Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"Respect for Congress is of course an important piece of our Constitutional system,\" Nichols said at that sentencing, also imposing a $6,500 fine.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_J._Nichols", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl J.

Circuit said all of Bannon's challenges lack merit. Prosecutor John Crabb told the judge it was \"very unlikely\" that the full appeals court or the Supreme Court would throw out Bannon's conviction.\n\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBannon's lawyer at trial argued that the charges were politically motivated and that the former adviser didn't ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\n\nThe defense has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Trump has asserted executive privilege.\n\nDefense lawyer David Schoen told the judge it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his sentence before he exhausts his appeals. He said the case raises \"serious constitutional issues\" that need to be examined by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"In this country, we don't send anyone to prison if they believe that they were doing something that complied with the law,\" Schoen told reporters.\n\nA second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress. He reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence.\n\nNavarro, too, had maintained that he couldn't cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. But courts have rejected that argument, finding Navarro couldn't prove Trump had actually invoked it.\n\nThe House Jan. 6 committee's final report asserted that Trump criminally engaged in a \"multi-part conspiracy\" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

with wire fraud and money laundering for taking for personal use millions of dollars contributed by donors toward the construction of a border wall with Mexico.\n\nWhile others were found guilty in the scheme, Trump issued a blanket pardon to Bannon before leaving office in January 2021, leading to the dismissal of the charges against him.\n\nTrump was scheduled to go on trial in Washington on

He told reporters outside the courthouse: \"I've got great lawyers, and we're going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Circuit said all of Bannon's challenges lack merit. Prosecutor John Crabb told the judge it was \"very unlikely\" that the full appeals court or the Supreme Court would throw out Bannon's conviction.\n\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBannon's lawyer at trial argued that the charges were politically motivated and that the former adviser didn't ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\n\nThe defense has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Trump has asserted executive privilege.\n\nDefense lawyer David Schoen told the judge it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his sentence before he exhausts his appeals. He said the case raises \"serious constitutional issues\" that need to be examined by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"In this country, we don't send anyone to prison if they believe that they were doing something that complied with the law,\" Schoen told reporters.\n\nA second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress. He reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence.\n\nNavarro, too, had maintained that he couldn't cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. But courts have rejected that argument, finding Navarro couldn't prove Trump had actually invoked it.\n\nThe House Jan. 6 committee's final report asserted that Trump criminally engaged in a \"multi-part conspiracy\" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

This means one of the MAGA movement's most prominent voices will be behind bars for a large portion of Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nThe far-right conservative who once led Breitbart News is now the second Trump White House official to go to prison for refusing to release documents and cooperate with the committee.

But on Thursday, June 6, a federal judge decided that in the meantime, the stay on his sentence will be lifted and he will be required to turn himself in.\n\nBannon was no longer working for the White House at the time of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which saw Trump supporters storm the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying the 2020 Electoral College count.\n\nBut the House select committee that investigated Jan. 6 said it had reason to believe that Bannon could provide relevant information on \"important activities that led to and informed\" the insurrection. The committee cited his comment on Jan. 5, 2021, that \"all hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\nWhen Bannon failed to show up for his deposition with the House select committee and refused to provide them documents, they recommended criminal charges. Soon, the Trump ally was indicted on two federal charges of contempt of Congress, and in July 2022, a jury found Bannon guilty of both counts.\n\nAt sentencing the Justice Department recommended six months in prison and a $200,000 fine, but he was instead sentenced to four months behind bars and a $6,500 fine.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_or_special_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Select or special committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deposition (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Iterated_Prisoner_Dilemma", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Iterated Prisoner Dilemma", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/pHq-KX9fa-Vq7yvrYiFGd6E6aaY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/steve-bannon-trump-2-2000-ae9e0d73cf3a47b5927e087136e3915d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628688", "eventUri": "eng-9628688", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 389, "textEnd": 395}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 805, "textEnd": 811}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Merrick Garland, Lisa Monaco, the entire Justice Department. They're not going to shut up, Trump. They're not going to shut up. Navarro. They're not going to shut up. Bannon.

Look at the rise of Donald Trump. If the election was held today, according to Harry Enten over at CNN, President Trump would win in a landslide.\n\nAll of this besides the. Major legal issues that have to be addressed. All of this is about one thing. This is about shutting down the MAGA movement, shutting down grassroots conservatives, shutting down President Trump. Not only are we winning, we are going to prevail in every number, and every poll shows that there's nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up. There's not a prison, there's not a prison, there's not a prison built. There's not a prison built or jail built that will ever shut me up. All victory to MAGA. We're going to win this.

There is nothing that can shut me up, and nothing that will shut me up.\"\n\nLast month, federal prosecutors asked the judge overseeing his case to reverse a stay of his sentence, arguing that \"there is no legal basis\" to block him from prison after an appeals court upheld his conviction.\n\nBannon's four-month prison sentence mirrors the one handed down to former Trump aide Peter Navarro, who also refused to comply with a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack.\n\nBannon was initially sentenced in October 2022, but the sentence was put on hold pending his appeal. That conviction was upheld last month.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Navarro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Iterated_Prisoner_Dilemma", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Iterated Prisoner Dilemma", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/06/18/2155670962.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628688", "eventUri": "eng-9628688", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 261, "textEnd": 267}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 353, "textEnd": 362}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

(WCIA) -- The skies above Champaign-Urbana have been busy for the last week with military aircraft repeatedly flying over the area. Willard Airport in Savoy has played host for when they land.\n\nAirport officials said a C-17 cargo plane made a landing last week. This week, it was F-16 and F-18 fighters. Although the increased air traffic is abnormal, officials said there is no cause for concern.\n\nThey're performing training operations and are making fuel stops on the runway. It's adding up to thousands of dollars in extra revenue for the airport. Willard Executive Director Tim Bannon said the airport sells about 600 gallons of jet fuel per plane.\n\nBannon also said some of these pilots are actually familiar with the area. One of the F-16 pilots was a graduate of the University of Illinois flight program prior to its dissolution.\n\n\"They were stopping in to grab some fuel, do some touch and goes and then talked to the Parkland Institute aviation students about opportunities in flying so that was that was really exciting,\" Bannon said.\n\nWillard Airport doesn't have much forewarning of when these planes will fly in, so Bannon isn't sure if this amount of military traffic will continue.\n\n\"The airport has to be open for all types of different aviation. So that's why they don't pre-clear anything for us. We have to be open for government aircraft as well, and that's kind of what we had the last week,\" Bannon said. \"We've had a lot of government traffic, and while it's a little bit unusual for us, it's completely normal. So, enjoy the show and we'll see them on the next time around.\"\n\nBannon said the airport doesn't anticipate any delays or disruptions to normal operations.", "source": {"uri": "wcia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCIA.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_krumm@wcia.com", "name": "Jack Krumm", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Savoy, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savoy, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_Willard_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Illinois Willard Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_C-17_Globemaster_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing C-17 Globemaster III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCIA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WCIA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Champaign\u2013Urbana_metropolitan_area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Champaign\u2013Urbana metropolitan area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cargo aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A-18 Hornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_Urbana-Champaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Runway"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Pilots", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Military", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.wcia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2024/06/snapshot-2.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628688", "eventUri": "eng-9628688", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot by supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\nA federal judge in Washington, D.C., at a hearing Thursday ordered former Trump White House aide Steve Bannon to report to jail by July 1 to begin serving a four-month sentence for his criminal contempt of Congress conviction.\n\nThe order by Judge Carl Nichols came three weeks after federal prosecutors urged him to lift a stay on Bannon's sentence pending an appeal of his conviction for failing to comply with a subpoena from a House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nA federal appeals court panel in a unanimous ruling on May 10 upheld Bannon's conviction in the case.\n\nAt Thursday's hearing, Bannon's lawyer David Shoen reacted emotionally to Nichols' order.\n\n\"One thing you have to learn as a lawyer is that when the judge has made his decision, you don't stand up and start yelling,\" Nichols said, according to NBC News.\n\n\"I've had enough,\" the judge said as Shoen continued talking.\n\nThe lawyer replied, \"I'm not yelling.\"\n\n\"You're sending a man to prison who thought he was complying with the law, we don't do that in my system,\" said Shoen, who argued that Nichols' ruling was \"contrary to our system of justice.\"\n\nNichols shot back, \"I think you should sit down.\"\n\nIt is possible that Bannon's jail sentence could be stayed by an order of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, or by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nBut Bannon's hopes of winning a stay of his sentence or a reversal of his conviction at either of those courts is, legally speaking, a long shot.\n\nIn March, Peter Navarro, another ex-adviser to former President Donald Trump, began serving a four-month federal jail sentence after the Supreme Court

Bannon, a Trump ally who served in his administration as a chief strategist, is banking on a second Trump term, and some have speculated on whom the Republican would choose to lead the Justice Department.\n\nOn a recent episode of his War Room podcast, Bannon told his guest, Sergio Gor, Donald Trump Jr.'s business partner in conservative publishing house Winning Team Publishing, that the former president's son would make a good pick for attorney general.\n\n\"One last thing, Sergio. Make sure you tell your partner, on Morning Joe this morning, they mentioned Don Jr. as attorney general. Hey, I gotta say I think it may go to the top of my list.... You don't need a law degree, you need common sense,\" Bannon said, speaking in a lighthearted tone.\n\n\"Don Jr.'s got common sense. I wanna put him at the top of the list now for AG, which I would love to be there for the confirmation hearing, sir,\" he said.\n\nGor replied: \"I love that idea, and I'll share that with him. I'm actually flying out with him in about an hour, so that'll be our topic of conversation.\"\n\n\"Yeah, tell him we're gonna push it hard,\" Bannon responded.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Bannon via text message, as well as Trump's campaign spokesperson via email, for comment.\n\nBannon was referring to comments made by Morning Joe co-host Willie Geist on the MSNBC show. In a recent conversation about Trump's legal troubles, Geist suggested that Trump believes if he wins the presidency his guilty verdict in the recent hush money trial and his three other indictments -- all of which he has pleaded not guilty to -- will go away.\n\n\"That's the bet: If he wins, it all goes away, and he's actually outside of the case that was just decided with the 34-felony guilty verdict against him last week,\" said Geist. \"He successfully has used delay tactics, his team has, to probably get these [other criminal cases] pushed past the election. He thinks if he wins, [Attorney General] Merrick Garland's out, he puts, I don't know, Don Jr. in as attorney general or something, and everything goes away.\"\n\nLast Thursday, Trump was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels shortly before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels alleges she had a sexual encounter with Trump in 2006, which he denies. Trump has maintained his innocence, and his legal team intends to appeal the verdict.\n\nIn addition, Trump and his allies have said that the four criminal cases brought against the former president are politically motivated. They argue that Democratic operatives are unfairly prosecuting Trump to undermine his presidential campaign and keep Biden in the White House.\n\nThere is no evidence that the cases against Trump are politically motivated or that Biden has had any involvement in them, including the two brought by the Justice Department's special counsel.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_dobkin@newsweek.com", "name": "Rachel Dobkin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Geist", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willie Geist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2405071/steve-bannon.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=490f65e4d95f40dde7cd22721386ef75", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628688", "eventUri": "eng-9628688", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

He told reporters outside the courthouse: \"I've got great lawyers, and we're going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to.\"\n\nFallout continues for wealthy St. Louis couple accused of poisoning neighbor's trees Masyn Winn's hit streak halts with strategic decision Cardinals manager 'didn't want to make' Pet food maker Purina too 'woke' for Missouri Republican.

It nearly died after a Mercy Health investigation.\n\nNichols, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, a Republican, had initially allowed Bannon to remain free while he fought his conviction.\n\nBut prosecutors urged the judge to revoke his bond after a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit said all of Bannon's challenges lack merit. Prosecutor John Crabb told the judge it was \"very unlikely\" that the full appeals court or the Supreme Court would throw out Bannon's conviction.\n\nBannon was convicted in 2022 of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 presidential election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nBannon's lawyer at trial argued that the charges were politically motivated and that the former adviser didn't ignore the subpoena but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\n\nThe defense has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Trump has asserted executive privilege.\n\nDefense lawyer David Schoen told the judge it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would have already completed his sentence before he exhausts his appeals. He said the case raises \"serious constitutional issues\" that need to be examined by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"In this country, we don't send anyone to prison if they believe that they were doing something that complied with the law,\" Schoen told reporters.\n\nA second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress. He reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence.\n\nNavarro, too, had maintained that he couldn't cooperate with the committee because Trump had invoked executive privilege. But courts have rejected that argument, finding Navarro couldn't prove Trump had actually invoked it.\n\nThe House Jan. 6 committee's final report asserted that Trump criminally engaged in a \"multi-part conspiracy\" to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and failed to act to stop his supporters from attacking the Capitol, concluding an extraordinary 18-month investigation into the former president and the violent insurrection.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

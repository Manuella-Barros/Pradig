Independent sitting Cllr Mair\u00edn McGrath is on 28.9pc, while Independent Cllr Andy Moloney is on 23.5pc. Daughter of Tipperary TD Mattie McGrath, Cllr McGrath (26) said her hard work has paid off and her message has resonated particularly with younger voters in their 20s frustrated at the housing situation. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet, it\u2019s still pretty close,\u201d said Cllr McGrath. \u201cThe last box has to be tallied, but I\u2019m delighted with my vote. It is reflected by my campaign. I knocked on every door in the LEA over the last eight weeks, and it was an ambition that I had to meet as many people as I could on the canvass. \u201cI think it\u2019s reflected in my work over the past five years as well. I\u2019m really thrilled.\u201d Cllr McGrath\u2019s slogan was \u2018reliable, relatable and resourceful\u2019. \u201cI am 26. I have been a Councillor for the past five years. I\u2019m always bringing a youth perspective to the Council. I will continue to do so.\u201d More so even in the last election, people in their 20s are now thinking \u2018is my future here in Ireland?\u2019 \u201cThere\u2019s so much of my cohort now who have gone abroad, and it\u2019s so important that we do have public representatives that are young.\u201d Housing and planning were definitely the number one issues, while immigration was usually only brought up on the doorstep in the context of housing shortages, she added. In Cahir, it looks like there won\u2019t be a major change, with sitting Cllrs Andy Moloney, FG Cllr Marie Murphy, and FF Cllr Mich\u00e9al Anglim looking likely to be returned. Eoin Kelleher Minister dismisses claims of Government 'running out of steam' The idea that the Government and Fine Gael as a party has run out of steam is a narrative that has been shattered, Public Expenditure minister Paschal Donohoe said at the count in Dublin. \"Another narrative that has been shattered is that Sinn F\u00e9in are agents of change and that there's an inevitability about Sinn F\u00e9in going into Government. \"They are a one trick pony -- and that one trick isn't working for the moment.\" He added: \"We are, I hope, going to see strong FG results come through across Dublin, in Dublin Central and across the country. \"And it is showing that the voters are responding back to our campaign.\" He paid tribute to \"the leadership of Simon Harris and the quality of our candidates across the country.\" Senan Molony Far-right predictions: Here's the lowdown on the Far Right so far - some success, but patchy elsewhere and maybe 5pc overall - at best. There is some success for Far Righters in the local elections, but in the Europeans they seem to have splintered the vote. In Dublin the Independent Ireland candidate Niall Boylan is poised for success and has been singing more than a few bars of the anti-migrant song, but is not an extreme right candidate per se. Hardliner Derek Bligh has polled well in Fermoy Local Electoral Area and is tipped to take a seat by seasoned observers, thanks to Independents topping the poll. He currently has 873 and is lying some way off, but the Ireland First candidate is expected to be carried forward by the redistribution of Independent surplus. Malachy Steenson, another right winger, is nailed on for a seat in the North Inner City. He is currently lying fourth of seven candidates with a tally of 894 votes. His vote share is put at 8.96pc. Mr Steenson is also on the European ticket, however he is unlikely to get a seat. One early European tally from a ballot box in the north inner city showed him with the most votes, however, this is unlikely to be replicated across the county, and will lead to his elimination. Gavin Pepper is another flying the Far Right flag. He is lying fifth of six (to qualify) in Finglas/Ballymun with 1,112 votes or 7.36pc of the vote. Tally folk say he is set to be elected. It is entrepreneur Michelle Keane\u2019s first time running in the Castleisland electoral area on Cork County Council. She rose to popularity through her well organised social media campaign and strong comments on immigration. She was contacted by Garda\u00ed over the language she used when speaking about migrants and local housing being used to accommodate them, allegedly labelling asylum seekers \u201csc**bags\u201d. While she is unlikely to be elected, tallies show she has polled very strongly and is only a couple of votes shy of a seat, with two independents, and a Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il seat ahead of her. She has taken a tally of 965, or 10pc. The consensus is that she has only an \"outside chance\" of a seat. There are two other notables of a right wing persuasion. Kevin Coyle in the Artane/Whitehall ward in Dublin, who has traded under the Ireland-s-full hashtag, has received 1,094 votes by tally and is said to have a chance. Stephen Kerr in Castlebar, Co Mayo, who made videos outside a hotel on the accommodation issue, is currently lying seventh on tally, with seven seats to be filled, on 874 votes -- 100 more than the third Fianna F\u00e1il candidate --- but will do well to avoid being overtaken. In Tallaght Central, where six seats are to be given out, Patrick Pearse Holohan -- an obvious Nationalist -- is set to get re-elected as a councillor. He had some things to say about former Taoiseach Leo Varadkar which raised eyebrows and caused tut-tutting. Senan Molony & Gabija Gataveckaite Senan Molony & Gabija Gataveckaite Senan Molony & Gabija Gataveckaite High emotions after councillor's mother's death: Sinn F\u00e9in Cllr David Dunne has spoken of how it is an emotional day for him, having retained his seat in Carrick-on-Suir despite suspending his campaign due to the death of his mother. With 100pc of the boxes counted in Carrick-on-Suir, it now looks like FF Cllr Imelda Goldsboro is topping the poll at 21.2pc, followed by SF Cllr David Dunne (18.2pc), Independent Michael Brennan (16.5pc), FG Cllr Mark Fitzgerald (14.9pc), FF Kieran Bourke (14.4pc), Cllr Kevin O\u2019Meara (11.4pc), and IFP Martin Murphy (3.4pc). \u201cMy Mum passed away during the election campaign so I didn\u2019t even canvass that much,\u201d said Cllr Dunne. \u201cOnly for my canvass team I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it at all. Overall, I\u2019m very happy and very proud for my Ma. It\u2019s a very emotional day for me.\u201d Cllr Dunne said he was proud of all the Sinn Fein candidates in Tipperary. \u201cIt takes a brave person to put their name on the ballot paper. We fought the good fight. We\u2019ll dust ourselves down and go again.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell. I wouldn\u2019t be judging anything on tallies. Tallies could be wrong. Definitely, there will be a fight for some of the seats. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see.\u201d Have the Independent candidates taken some of the Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s votes? \u201cAn Independent candidate is going to lose his seat in Carrick,\u201d said Cllr Dunne. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixed bag for the Independents. And the Independents are a mixed bag.\u201d Eoin Kelleher 'I am over-excited': Westmeath's Kevin \u2018Boxer\u2019 Moran on his landslide turn to local politics \"I am over-excited. \"When I lost my seat a number of years ago, it was a big blow and a big hurt, put I have put it behind me. 'One thing I heard while canvassing was people telling me \"Boxer, I hope this is your step forward and we\u2019ll get you back into the D\u00e1il.\" That\u2019s the plan but we take nothing for granted \u2013 we enjoy today. \"I know the Taoiseach this week said there would be no election, but I think with some of the TD\u2019s being elected to Europe puts pressure on the Taoiseach to make this move sooner rather than later. \"Over the last four years I have had a lot of time to think and we are going back to basics now. If the opportunity comes to up to represent this great county in Dail Eireann, I will do that and I look forward to that day when it comes.\" Aoife Rooney", "summary": "<tickaroo>{\n  \"themeId\": \"lct_653b7fa7fed115003648bab8\",\n  \"clientId\": \"64772ae4d1d7dec0c5b716af\",\n  \"liveblogId\": \"66629cc432bbc2726ccd5013\"\n}</tickaroo>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/elections-2024/live-local-and-european-elections-2024-results-trickle-in-as-fianna-fail-and-fine-gael-battle-it-out-for-top-spot/a1657554728.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/QrqLAWPLIKHrFYfu0fhJ53pd93Y=/60x0:735x450/629x0/prod-mh-ireland/22ab6c53-b798-4226-a162-f86f57765bd2/9bcdca1a-7979-4aae-9c34-25e868488db9/video/video.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:06:31", "author": null, "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.081}

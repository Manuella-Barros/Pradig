After Getting Called Out By His Former QB", "body": "A ton of NFL players were in attendance when Christian McCaffrey and Olivia Culpo got married at the end of June, but there was a pretty notable name omitted from the guest list in the form of Cam Newton.\n\nHowever, the running back says his former quarterback would've been there if he'd been able to track him down.\n\nOn June 29th, Christian McCaffrey and Olivia Culpo officially tied the knot at a ritzy hotel right down the street from Taylor Swift's house in Watch Hill, Rhode Island in a ceremony that was unsurprisingly overflowing with notable names that got the chance to celebrate with the happy couple.\n\nThe 49ers were well-represented thanks to a list of guys that boasted Kyle Shanahan, George Kittle, and Brock Purdy, and the running back also invited a number of former teammates from his days with the Panthers, as Greg Olsen, Luke Kuechly, and Jonathan Stewart made up some of the Carolina delegation.\n\nHowever, that crew did not include Cam Newton, who connected with McCaffrey for 12 touchdown passes during the three seasons they spent together on the Panthers roster.\n\nDuring a recent episode of 4th & 1, Newton made it pretty clear he felt he was snubbed while saying he didn't even realize McCaffrey got married until he came across a picture of Olsen at the wedding online.\n\nHe seemed to think his absence was the result of Brock Purdy being in attendance, implying McCaffrey wanted to avoid any potential awkwardness stemming from the \"game manager\" comments that caused a bit of a stir last year.\n\nHowever, McCaffrey quickly hopped into the comments to clarify the situation by recounting a conversation he had with Olsen at the wedding, saying Newton hasn't returned a single text he's sent him in the past four years.\n\nNewton eventually responded by asking McCaffrey to send him his number in the hopes of reconnecting, so while he may have missed out on the wedding, a reunion could be in store.", "source": {"uri": "brobible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BroBible"}, "authors": [{"uri": "connor_toole@brobible.com", "name": "Connor Toole", "type": "author", "isAgency":

An occurrence that can be quite awkward when you see that person or talk to them after the fact.\n\nThis is something that San Francisco 49ers superstar running back Christian McCaffrey experienced following his viral wedding with former Miss Universe Olivia Culpo. In the comment section of his Instagram post that commemorated his wedding night, McCaffrey shared a conversation that he had with fellow former Carolina Panther, Greg Olsen.\n\nThe topic of discussion was about their former quarterback, Cam Newton, who was not on the receiving end of a wedding invitation.\n\nIn a comment that may have been inspired by the hundreds of people asking why Newton wasn't invited, McCaffrey provided the transcript of him talking to Olsen at the wedding. McCaffrey said that he actually wished that Newton was in fact there, but revealed that Newton had either blocked him or gotten a new number and never given it to him, while also saying he hasn't heard from him in four years.\n\nNewton can be seen responding to the comment, asking McCaffrey which number he has, which may indicate there was a miscommunication. Newton addressed the situation on his podcast 4thand1show, expressing that he would have loved to be invited and attend the celebration. Newton also speculated that McCaffrey didn't invite him due to his criticisms of McCaffrey's current quarterback, Brock Purdy, in a not-safe-for-work rant.\n\nMaybe the two can reconnect somewhere down the line, but Newton did finish off his rant with a congratulations to the happy couple.", "source": {"uri": "athlonsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Athlon Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_borba@athlonsports.com", "name": "Kevin Borba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_McCaffrey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Christian McCaffrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cam Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Olsen_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greg Olsen (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newton, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newton, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Culpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Culpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miss Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Purdy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brock Purdy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Weddings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations_and_Announcements", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations and Announcements", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Accessories", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://athlonsports.com/.image/t_share/MjA3NzY1NjAwNzk2MTU3NDE0/usatsi_17164542.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9725095", "eventUri": "eng-9725095", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

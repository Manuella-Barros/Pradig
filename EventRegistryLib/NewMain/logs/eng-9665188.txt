It overtook Apple earlier this month.The Californian company's meteoric rise has been fuelled by its dominance of what analysts call the \"new gold or oil in the tech sector\" - the chips needed for artificial intelligence (AI).Speaking at an event in Copenhagen, Chris Penrose, global head of business development for telco at Nvidia, predicted further growth in the sector.\"The generative AI journey is really transforming businesses and telcos around the world,\" he said.\"We're just at the beginning.\"Analysts Wedbush Securities agreed.\"We believe over the next year the race to $4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and centre between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,\" it said in a note earlier this week.Other commentators though have questioned whether there will be big future gains, given the increasing competition Nvidia faces.Rise and riseWhat is not in doubt though is how spectacularly it has grown.Eight years ago, the stock was worth less than 1% of its current price.Back then, Nvidia's value came from its competition with rival AMD, in a race to make the best graphics cards.In recent years though it has benefited from a boom in demand for chips that train and run generative AI models, the most well known of which being OpenAI's ChatGPT.The firm also benefitted significantly from a rush to mine Bitcoin in 2020, which saw a sharp uptick in sales of its graphics cards.The rise and rise of the tech giant has been mirrored by the increasingly high profile of its boss, Jensen Huang.Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg even called the 61-year-old electrical engineer - known for his signature leather jacket - the \"Taylor Swift of tech\" for the celebrity status he has achieved.He's become well-known thanks in part to his popularity in his native Taiwan, where fans treat him as a rock star - posing for photos and even asking him to sign body parts.Competition among AI developers is fierce. Microsoft, Google-owner Alphabet, Meta and Apple are just some of the tech heavyweights battling to create a world-beating product.This competition benefits Nvidia, which as well as developing AI tech of its own, dominates the vast majority of the AI chip market.Nvidia's sales and profit figures have surpassed many analyst expectations in recent years.In May, after its latest set of financial results were published, Quilter Cheviot technology analyst Ben Barringer said the company had \"once again cleared a very high hurdle\".\"Demand is showing no signs of switching off either,\" he added.However, a minority are more cautious.In February, Barclays credit analyst Sandeep Gupta argued that Nvidia's large market share would be hard to maintain given the increasing number of rivals

With a market capitalization of $3.34 trillion currently, Nvidia has become the world's most valuable listed company. This marked a historic achievement in the tech industry.\n\nNvidia Stock Witnesses Impressive Rally\n\nThis meteoric rise is underscored by the company's share price, which has nearly doubled since the beginning of the year. Moreover, the Nvidia stock attained a monthly high of $140.76 in today's trading session. The company's rapid ascent has seen it not only surpass the value of individual European markets but also overtake major tech giants.\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia surpassed Apple's market value and is now more valuable than Microsoft. The key driver behind Nvidia's unparalleled growth is its dominance in the semiconductor industry. Specifically, in the production of chips essential for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Analysts have referred to these chips as the \"new gold or oil\" of the tech sector, highlighting their critical role in the ongoing AI revolution.\n\nChris Penrose, Nvidia's global head of business development for telecommunications, emphasized the transformative impact of AI on businesses worldwide during a recent event in Copenhagen. \"The generative AI journey is really transforming businesses and telcos around the world,\" Penrose remarked.\n\nIn addition, he suggested that Nvidia's growth trajectory is just beginning. His sentiments were echoed by analysts at Wedbush Securities, who predicted a fierce race among Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft to reach a $4 trillion market cap in the coming year.\n\nDespite the bullish outlook from many quarters, some analysts have raised concerns about the sustainability of Nvidia's rapid growth. The increasing competition in the AI and semiconductor sectors could pose significant challenges. Nonetheless, the current market position of Nvidia reflects the company's strategic positioning and innovation capabilities, particularly in AI. These factors have become a critical driver of technological advancement and business transformation.\n\nNVDA Surpasses UK & France Stock Market Size\n\nCurrently, the U.K. stock market cap stands at $3.18 trillion while French stock market size is $3.13 trillion. Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid noted the historical context of the Nvidia stock surge. \"Exactly a decade ago the entire listed U.K. stock market was 400 times larger than Nvidia. In the last week, Nvidia overtook it,\" Reid observed.\n\nAs Nvidia shares climbed 3.6% in pre-market trading today, the European markets also showed positive movement. At press time, the NVDA stock soared 1.87% to $138.12 in the trading session Thursday, June 20.\n\nFrance's CAC 40 index rose by 0.8% and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 up by 0.3%. The future trajectory of Nvidia will be closely watched by investors and industry analysts as the company continues to shape the AI landscape and redefine market valuations in the tech sector.", "source": {"uri": "coingape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Coingape"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FTSE 100 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAC_40", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CAC 40"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/17-facts-about-nvidia-1689447088-1224x689-1-e1718894061905.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 2964, "textEnd": 2971}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

With investors still loving Nvidia, the stock climbed to a record high Thursday before pulling back.\n\nBarclay's analyst Tom O'Malley and Susquehanna analyst Christopher Rolland raised the price target to 145 from 120, split adjusted. Supply chain checks were reassuring and showed that the transition from Hopper chips to Blackwell will be smooth.\n\nDemand Rising For AI Chips In Servers\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia said it plans to roll out its most advanced artificial intelligence platform in 2026. The AI chip leader will also use next generation memory to improve process time.\n\nAlso in early June, Foxconn announced its plans to build an advanced computing center in Taiwan using Nvidia's Blackwell chips. Nvidia has teamed up with Foxconn to build data centers to expand into autonomous driving and the electric vehicles market. While leading electric-vehicle player Tesla (TSLA) uses Nvidia's chips, it plans to custom build them in-house in the future.\n\nNvidia Stock Split Takes Effect\n\nShares started trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 1o.\n\nBut the split could go beyond just lowering the price of each share. A lower price would make Nvidia a candidate for the Dow 30, which is a price-weighted index.\n\nPreviously, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) joined the Dow after stock splits.\n\nThe stock split will build further momentum for the AI chip leader and present what one analyst called a \"generational buying opportunity.\"\n\nIn late May, Nvidia shares soared above the pre-split 1,100 level for the first time after Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk indicated the AI chip leader would be a supplier for his AI startup xAI. Musk's startup raised $6 billion in the latest round of funding over the weekend and it plans to build a supercomputer to support its AI chatbot.\n\nFirst-Quarter Results Shine\n\nShares of Nvidia rose to record highs after fiscal first-quarter results beat estimates yet again on May 22. Sales grew 262% to $26 billion while earnings of $6.12 per share were 461% higher.\n\nThe AI leader has also teamed up with Microsoft to make the latest AI software available on Nvidia's graphic processing units.\n\nEarlier, Nvidia shares rose past a handle buy point after the Google AI Conference showed different ways in which artificial intelligence will improve search. The search giant also previewed an Android feature that will alert users to scams during a phone call. While Google's tensor processing units are rivals to Nvidia's chips, Nvidia dominates the data center AI chips market.\n\nAhead of the earnings report, analysts at Baird, Susquehanna and Barclays increased their price targets on Nvidia.\n\nNvidia has earned a reputation for being a trailblazer. The company was an early pioneer in the graphics processors that many say drastically improved computer gaming. Along with gaming, Nvidia chips now are used in such industries as health care, automobiles and robotics.\n\nIn March 2023, generative AI took a leap forward with OpenAI's ChatGPT. According to Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang, Nvidia's AI-capable supercomputer paved the way for the \"iPhone moment of AI.\"\n\nThat helped Nvidia turn the tide on its results. It reported three quarters of declining year-over-year sales and four quarters of tapering earnings in late 2022 and early 2023. But then the company achieved record top- and bottom-line growth in the two most recent quarters.\n\nOverall worldwide AI chip revenue will grow 26% from $53.4 billion in 2023 to $67.1 billion in 2024, according to a recent report from research firm Gartner. That is expected to double to $119 billion by 2027.\n\nNvidia's graphic processing units help accelerate computing in data centers and AI applications.\n\nNvidia also is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks that led the 2023 stock rally. The other stocks are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), Tesla and Amazon.com. Some of these tech titans are customers that rely on Nvidia's advanced chips. Nvidia is also one of the stocks that are forecast to outperform the market in 2024.\n\nIs Nvidia A Buy?\n\nChart patterns are a good way of telling when to buy or sell a stock. Nvidia's chart shows the stock has cleared a 92.22 buy point. The stock is already extended, according to IBD MarketSurge.\n\nIn 2023, AI stock Nvidia had a huge 239% run and it's up more than 190% so far this year.\n\nNvidia has climbed above profit-taking targets at 20% and 25% from 92.20 and an alternative buy point at 97.40. It's best now to wait for another base or follow-on buy point to make an initial position in the AI chip stock. It is not a buy right now.\n\nFind Winning Stocks With MarketSurge Pattern Recognition & Custom Screens\n\nIBD Live: Learn And Analyze Growth Stocks With The Pros\n\nLooking For The Next Big Stock Market Winners?

This shift is driven by Nvidia's pivotal role in the rapidly growing Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector, thanks to its high-end processors.\n\nAccording to data from S&P Global, the company surpassed two renowned tech companies on Tuesday, 18th June 2024 to become the top-ranked public company in terms of value worldwide. The company's remarkable growth can be attributed to the flourishing field of generative artificial intelligence and the increasing need for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which have played a pivotal role in the development of AI systems.\n\nThe company's rise is among the fastest in market history. Just two years ago, the company's market valuation was a little over $400 billion. Now, within a year, it has skyrocketed from $1 trillion to over $3 trillion.\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia's share price rose by 3.6 percent, lifting its value to $3.34 trillion. Meanwhile, Microsoft and Apple both experienced declines, ending the day trailing the Silicon Valley chipmaker.\n\nNvidia's ascent underscores the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on the world's largest companies. The rise of AI first elevated Microsoft to the top market capitalization in January, dethroning Apple, before pushing Nvidia to take the crown. Last week, Apple announced its entry into the AI space, planning to incorporate the technology into its products, including the iPhone, this fall.\n\nYears before other major chip companies, Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, foresaw the importance of GPUs in building AI and aligned his company's strategy accordingly. This foresight is now paying off, with the company controlling over 80 percent of the market for AI system chips. Major customers regularly compete for its chips to power their vast data centers, while also developing their own AI chips to reduce reliance on Nvidia.\n\n\"No one else fully saw or appreciated this,\" said Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, a tech research firm. \"They saw the trend, built for the trend, and enabled the market. They can effectively charge whatever they want.\"\n\nNvidia's rapid ascent has made Huang, aged 61, a celebrity in the tech world. After a recent conference in Taiwan, attendees eagerly sought his autograph, with one woman even asking him to sign her chest.\n\nThe company's rise is reminiscent of dot-com era titans like Cisco and Juniper Networks, which built the infrastructure for the internet. Cisco's shares increased more than a thousand-fold from its initial public offering in 1990 to 2000, when it briefly became the world's most valuable company.\n\nThe speed at which Nvidia's value has grown is remarkable. Apple took nearly five years to climb from $1 trillion to $3 trillion, and Microsoft took a similar amount of time. Nvidia's investors are banking more on its potential than its current profits. While Microsoft and Apple each generated over $21 billion in profit during the three months ending in March, the company generated $14.88 billion in its most recent quarter, a 600 percent increase from the previous year.\n\n\"The numbers have gotten so big so quickly that people worry: Is this sustainable?\" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein Research. \"If the return on AI turns out not to be there, then the whole thing comes crumbling down.\"\n\nSince its inception, only 12 companies have led the S&P 500 by market valuation, with Nvidia joining the ranks of AT&T, Apple, Cisco, DuPont, Exxon Mobil, General Electric, General Motors, IBM, Microsoft, Philip Morris, and Walmart, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nNvidia's success is largely due to consistently exceeding Wall Street expectations. In its last quarter, sales tripled from a year earlier to $26 billion, and the company projected it would double sales in the current quarter.\n\nNvidia sells everything from chips and the software needed to build AI systems with those chips to supercomputers. These machines, packed with Nvidia's GPUs, sell for $250,000 or more, with new models potentially exceeding $1 million.\n\n\"Even though the cost of the system is going up, the performance per dollar is getting better with every generation, and that's how they're able to keep customers buying,\" Rasgon said.\n\nWall Street is closely monitoring for signs of a slowdown. Companies like Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon have all developed their own AI chips, while traditional chip rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are attempting to break into Nvidia's market with their own AI processors.\n\nHowever, Huang believes it will take time for competitors to catch up. Nvidia has a decade head start and a large community of AI programmers who prefer its technology.\n\n\"We are fundamentally changing how computing works and what computers can do,\" Jensen Huang said in a conference call with analysts in May. \"The next industrial revolution has begun.\"", "source": {"uri": "myjoyonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyJoyOnline.com"}, "authors": [],

Steve Jobs had recently returned to lead Apple. Intel was the dominant force in semiconductors. And a little-known chip maker named Nvidia made its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nIt took less than three years for Nvidia to ascend into the S&P 500 -- replacing the disgraced oil-trading conglomerate Enron, no less.\n\nBut even then, few people would have bet that the company would go on to become the best-performing stock of the last quarter century, posting a total return of 591 078% since its initial public offering, including reinvested dividends. It's a difficult number to comprehend and a testament, in part, to the financial mania brewing around artificial intelligence and how investors have come to see Nvidia -- which makes the cutting-edge chips powering the technology -- as the single-biggest winner of the boom.\n\nOn Tuesday, that run culminated in Nvidia unseating Microsoft as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalisation of $3.34-trillion.\n\nThe company's rise was by no means assured -- and neither is its staying power at the top of the S&P 500. Long-time investors in Nvidia have had to stomach three annual collapses of 50% or more in the stock. Sustaining the current rally will require customers to keep spending billions of dollars a quarter on AI equipment, whose returns on investment are so far relatively small.\n\nWhat ultimately paved the way for Nvidia to climb to the top, though, was the company's big bet on graphics chips and the vision of co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang that the industry would shift to what he calls \"accelerated computing\", something his chips are inherently better at than the competition.\n\n\"You have to give the management team, I think, an enormous amount of credit,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \"They have caught each wave of innovation in hardware perfectly well.\"\n\nHere's a look at Nvidia from its 1999 listing to now.\n\nNvidia got off to a hot start. Between its debut and entering the S&P 500, Nvidia had gained more than 1 600%, giving it a market value of about $8-billion. That rise came as many other technology stocks were cratering in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, which peaked in March 2000.\n\nThe company's key to early success: getting its technology in videogame consoles like Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Nvidia's GeForce graphics processing units, or GPUs, became objects of desire among gamers because they consistently offered the most realistic experience.\n\n\"Jensen was always a great communicator, told a good story, and clearly GPUs were becoming more important,\" said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management, who was a buyer in the IPO. \"Each successive generation of hardware gave a lot better performance, a lot more realistic picture and then PC gaming really came into being.\"\n\nThe next six years weren't kind to Nvidia. The stock plunged in 2008 as the financial crisis weakened demand and long-struggling rival AMD started upping its game.\n\nMeanwhile, an agreement between Nvidia and Intel that allowed the companies to use each other's capabilities went sour, forcing Nvidia out of one of its biggest markets. The two settled in 2011, with Intel agreeing to pay Nvidia $1.5-billion.\n\nThe following year, Nvidia unveiled graphics chips for servers inside data centres. They could help sophisticated computing work such as oil and gas exploration and weather prediction, giving Nvidia a foothold in what would become a lucrative market. However, those chips did not immediately fly off the shelf. It would take nearly nine years for Nvidia shares to surpass their 2007 high.\n\nNvidia shares were taking off again in 2015. During that period, Nvidia chips were becoming the foundation of emerging technologies, from advanced graphics interfaces to autonomous vehicles to a new wave of AI products.\n\nThat's when Shana Sissel, CEO at Banrion Capital Management, first really took note of the company. She described a 2017 conference where Nvidia was more like a pageant winner than an investment idea.\n\n\"Every single speaker talked about Nvidia being the most important company,\" Sissel said. \"At that point, it was really on my radar screen.\"\n\nEven after demand from cryptocurrency miners dried up, data centre sales continued to grow. The Covid-19 pandemic boosted that business, as companies needed to purchase additional computing power to support remote work. Nvidia's data centre revenue rose by a multiple of eight from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021.\n\nNvidia's shares slumped in 2022 along with the rest of the technology sector, which was reeling from soaring interest rates and falling demand after the Covid-era boom.\n\nOpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late 2022 made an instant splash but it took time for investors to realise how Nvidia might benefit. Eventually, an explosion of interest in generative AI products including ChatGPT sent orders for Nvidia's chips through the roof.\n\nThe scale shocked nearly everyone in May 2023 when Nvidia's results beat even the most optimistic Wall Street estimates. The company gave a forecast for quarterly sales that was more than 50% above the average projection.\n\nNvidia's data centre sales eclipsed its gaming revenue for the first time in fiscal 2023. In Nvidia's current fiscal year, which ends in January, analysts expect those sales to top $100-billion.\n\n\"They have a very defensible place in the industry,\" said Williams. \"They're not going to be 95% of market share forever, obviously, but it would be almost impossible for anybody to replace them.\" -- Jeran Wittenstein and Carmen Reinicke, with Ian King, (c) 2024 Bloomberg LP", "source": {"uri": "techcentral.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCentral"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://techcentral.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jensen-huang-1500-800-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2000-03-", "textStart": 2247, "textEnd": 2257}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

But these multigenerational brand names are now trailing behind Nvidia, suddenly the most-valuable public company in the world.\n\nThe tech behemoth whose prescient decision to launch into AI chipmaking sent its stock into the stratosphere is hardly a household name. Many people can't even pronounce it (it's en-VID-eeyah, the company says on its website).\n\n\"I just read that it is now the world's most valuable company, surpassing Microsoft. Why is that, because what does it do?\" one user posted on Reddit on Tuesday. Many Nvidia investors who hopped on the train likely can't explain what it does either.\n\nWith a market value of over $3 trillion, Nvidia is worth more than most countries' entire economies. How did Nvidia get there?\n\nArtificial intelligence wasn't on the minds of Nvidia's founders when they launched the company 31 years ago over a meal at Denny's, where its CEO Jensen Huang worked at one point as a dishwasher. Their discussion revolved around finding a way to boost the processing capabilities of computers, especially graphics-intensive applications, Huang said in a recent interview that aired on \"60 Minutes.\" That was the impetus for Nvidia entering the graphics processing unit, or GPU, space in 1999. (While Nvidia popularized the term, it didn't invent it, though it is often mistakenly credited with having done so.)\n\nNvidia's GPUs revolutionized the gaming industry, bringing to market new games with movie-like visuals, whereas prior games were 2-D.\n\nEventually, the company took things one step further, creating a programming language that enabled developers to create applications to run on its hardware. By 2012, it discovered that its chips could be used to power much, much more than video games, chief among those: artificial intelligence applications.\n\nStill, the company remained relatively obscure to most investors and consumers -- except for hardcore PC gamers.\n\nThat all changed in November 2022, when OpenAI announced ChatGPT, which shocked the world, permanently altering people's understanding of AI's capabilities. The app's stunning ability to mimic human speech and perform complex tasks shook Silicon Valley and Wall Street.\n\nSuppose everyone collectively at the same time decided they don't want to commute to work by driving or using mass transit. Instead, everyone is going to bike to work from here on out. Well, naturally demand for bikes is going to explode overnight. Want to get in on the action and start making bikes? You're going to need a lot of steel. Nvidia is the steel of AI.\n\nNow that just about every company, tech or not, is trying to find some way to use AI after OpenAI's success made them look silly in comparison, everyone needs a lot of Nvidia.\n\nIt's no wonder why it was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2023, gaining a whopping 239%. Up an additional 181% so far this year, it's been the best-performing again.\n\nAll that demand for Nvidia chips surely must've increased competition, right?\n\nSlowly but surely it has with heavyweights like Meta, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft starting to play catch-up. However, none of them are coming close to Nvidia's capabilities in the AI space, which is why it controls upwards of 70% of the market in AI chips.\n\nWall Street's love affair with AI doesn't seem like it'll ever end. Could it all be one big bubble that's bound to burst like the dot-com era? Maybe, but it seems less likely given the intrinsic value AI carries.

Or should buyers beware of another drop in share price? Let's take a look at what's going on with Nvidia stock.\n\nThere were many reasons for Nvidia stock's recent share surge. The company's stock has seen an impressive rise, fuelled by its dominance in producing processors for artificial intelligence (AI) systems, which are integral to technologies like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Nvidia's stock soared by about 174% this year and was the best performer in the S&P 500 in 2023.\n\nYet, with shares climbing to all-time highs in the four-digit range, the company made the decision to make a 10-for-1 stock split on June 7. Now, shares are at about US$140 as of writing. This led to yet another surge in share price from those who had been sitting on the sidelines.\n\nSo, is this it? Or does the stock have more to come?\n\nNvidia stock's financial performance has been robust. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company reported record revenues of US$26 billion, an 18% increase from the previous quarter and a 262% increase from the previous year. Key areas contributing to this growth include data centres, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive sectors.\n\nNow, Nvidia stock is well-positioned to continue its leadership in the graphics processing units (GPU), AI, and semiconductor industries. Analysts are optimistic about its future, with Bank of America reiterating a price target of US$1,500 per share (or US$150 after the recent stock split), suggesting a 7% upside. The AI and semiconductor markets are expected to undergo significant infrastructure upgrades, with Nvidia stock leading the charge due to its technological edge and extensive developer support.\n\nYet, if you fear that it all depends on Nvidia stock, it certainly doesn't. Nvidia stock has strategically partnered with several key players in the tech industry to bolster its AI and computing capabilities. This includes Amazon; Nvidia is expanding its collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to enhance the development of AI solutions. This partnership aims to integrate Nvidia's GPUs into AWS's cloud services, providing robust infrastructure for AI and machine learning workloads.\n\nNvidia stock has also created partnerships with Alphabet through Google Cloud, Microsoft through its Azure cloud platform, Oracle, and Johnson & Johnson. All of these should continue to help bring in revenue.\n\nNow, no investment is without concerns, and Nvidia stock certainly has some. Despite the company's strong performance and strategic collaborations, there are several concerns that investors should consider. For instance, as Nvidia continues to dominate the AI and GPU markets, there is a risk of market saturation. The high growth rates seen in recent years may not be sustainable indefinitely, and the company could face challenges in maintaining its current growth trajectory.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia stock faces increasing competition from other semiconductor companies like AMD and Intel. These competitors are investing heavily in their AI and GPU technologies, which could potentially erode Nvidia's market share.\n\nThere is also the semiconductor industry as a whole. The semiconductor industry has been plagued by supply chain disruptions, which could impact Nvidia's production capabilities. Any significant disruptions could delay product releases and affect the company's financial performance. And some analysts now believe the company is overvalued based on this.\n\nAll considered, while Nvidia's strategic collaborations position it well for future growth, potential investors should also be mindful of the various risks and challenges the company faces. Balancing these factors is crucial for making informed investment decisions.", "source": {"uri": "fool.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool Canada"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_legate_wolfe@fool.ca", "name": "Amy Legate-Wolfe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Cloud_Platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google Cloud Platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_&_Johnson", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Johnson & Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.fool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/finger-on-head-brain-smart-good-idea-1200x800.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 690, "textEnd": 696}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Steve Jobs had recently returned to lead Apple. Intel was the dominant force in semiconductors. And a little-known chipmaker named Nvidia made its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nIt took less than three years for Nvidia Corp to ascend into the S&P 500 -- replacing the disgraced oil-trading conglomerate Enron, no less.\n\nBut even then, few people would have bet that the company would go on to become the best performing stock of the last quarter-century, posting a total return of 591,078% since its initial public offering, including reinvested dividends. It's a difficult number to comprehend and a testament, in part, to the financial mania brewing around artificial intelligence and how investors have come to see Nvidia -- which makes the cutting-edge chips powering the technology -- as the single-biggest winner of the boom.\n\nOn Tuesday, that run culminated in Nvidia unseating Microsoft Corp as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalisation of $3.34tn. More than $2tn of that value has been added this year.\n\nThe company's rise was by no means assured -- and neither is its staying power at the top of the S&P 500. Long-time investors in Nvidia have had to stomach three annual collapses of 50% or more in the stock. Sustaining the current rally will require customers to keep spending billions of dollars a quarter on AI equipment, whose returns on investment are so far relatively small.\n\nWhat ultimately paved the way for Nvidia to climb to the top, though, was the company's big bet on graphics chips and the vision of co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang that the industry would shift to what he calls \"accelerated computing,\" something his chips are inherently better at than the competition.\n\n\"You have to give the management team, I think, an enormous amount of credit,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. \"They have caught each wave of innovation in hardware perfectly well.\" Early Years Nvidia got off to a hot start.\n\nBetween its debut and the time it entered the S&P 500, the stock gained more than 1,600%, giving it a market value of about $8bn. That rise came as many other technology stocks were cratering in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, which peaked in March 2000.\n\nThe company's key to early success: getting its technology in video-game consoles like Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation. Nvidia's GeForce graphics processing units, or GPUs, became objects of desire among gamers because they consistently offered the most realistic experience.\n\n\"Jensen was always a great communicator, told a good story, and clearly GPUs were becoming more important,\" said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management, who was a buyer in the IPO. \"Each successive generation of hardware gave a lot better performance, a lot more realistic picture and then PC gaming really came into being.\"\n\nThe next six years weren't kind to Nvidia. The stock plunged in 2008 as the financial crisis weakened demand and long-struggling rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc started turning things around.\n\nMeanwhile, an agreement between Nvidia and Intel that allowed the companies to use each other's capabilities went sour, forcing Nvidia out of one of its biggest markets. The two settled in 2011, with Intel agreeing to pay Nvidia $1.5bn.\n\nThe following year, Nvidia unveiled graphics chips for servers inside data centres. They could help sophisticated computing work such as oil and gas exploration and weather prediction, giving Nvidia a foothold in what would become a lucrative market. However, those chips did not immediately fly off the shelf. It would take nearly nine years for Nvidia shares to surpass their 2007 high.\n\nNvidia shares took off again in 2015. During that period, the company's chips were becoming the foundation of emerging technologies, from advanced graphics interfaces to autonomous vehicles to a new wave of AI products.\n\nThat's when Shana Sissel, chief executive officer at Banrion Capital Management, first really took note of the company. She described a 2017 conference where Nvidia was more like a pageant winner than an investment idea.\n\n\"Every single speaker talked about Nvidia being the most important company,\" Sissel said. \"At that point, it was really on my radar screen.\" Even after demand from cryptocurrency miners dried up, data-centre sales continued to grow. The Covid-19 pandemic boosted that business, as companies needed to purchase additional computing power to support remote work. Nvidia's data-centre revenue rose by a multiple of eight from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2021.\n\nNvidia's shares slumped in 2022 along with the rest of the technology sector, which was reeling from soaring interest rates and falling demand after the Covid-era boom.\n\nOpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late-2022 made an instant splash but it took time for investors to realise how Nvidia might benefit. Eventually, interest in ChatGPT and other generative AI products exploded, triggering a frantic surge in orders for Nvidia's chips.\n\nWhen the company reported first-quarter 2023 earnings, the scale of the jump in its business shocked nearly everyone on Wall Street. Nvidia gave a forecast for quarterly sales that was more than 50% above the average projection.\n\nNvidia's data-centre sales eclipsed its gaming revenue for the first time in fiscal 2023. In Nvidia's current fiscal year, analysts expect those sales to top $100bn.\n\n\"They have a very defensible place in the industry,\" said Williams, the strategist at Wayve Capital Management. \"They're not gonna be 95% of market share forever, obviously, but it would be almost impossible for anybody to replace them.\"", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Return on investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate_(company)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conglomerate (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dividend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PC game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.gulf-times.com/gulftimes/uploads/images/2024/06/20/thumbs/300x300/191038.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2000-03-", "textStart": 2285, "textEnd": 2295}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The company has overtaken Microsoft to reach the pinnacle with $3.33 trillion in market cap, edging past Microsoft's $3.31 trillion market cap, as per stats on Marketcap (via Gamespot).\n\nAfter the top two spots, Apple is ranked third at $3.2 trillion, followed by Google's parent company Alphabet which has a market cap of $2.17 trillion. Amazon is the fifth most valuable company with its market cap at $1.90 trillion at the time of writing.\n\nNvidia is a leading graphics card manufacturer and faces active competition from AMD, but the rival company also invests its time and energy into providing processors to the tech market. While Nvidia's GeForce RTX graphics cards have been facilitating AAA gaming in desktops and laptops for years, this rise to the top could be attributed to the recent AI boom.\n\nNvidia has long been known for investing its resources and research into AI, and its shift in focus can be dated back to as far back as 2006 when it released Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), a parallel computing platform.\n\nThe focus on AI has paid dividends for Nvidia in the long run, now that the tech market is chasing after an AI-powered future. To achieve that, tech companies that are investing in AI require GPUs that can handle the AI processes, and that's where Nvidia's value comes into play. The company's stock price has seen over 200% growth since 2023.\n\nWith the focus on generative AI increasing rapidly, and companies such as Microsoft and Apple introducing the likes of Copilot+ and Apple Intelligence, Nvidia stands to profit.

This remarkable feat comes amid blockbuster earnings and growing investor enthusiasm over artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia is now the 12th US company since 1925 to claim the top spot in market value. Here's a detailed look at how Nvidia reached this unprecedented milestone.\n\nWith a market value of $3.334 trillion, Nvidia is now worth more than the GDP of all but six of the world's biggest economies. Only the US, China, Germany, Japan, India and the UK are ahead of Nvidia.\n\nTechnological Innovation\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise can be attributed primarily to its groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs). Initially renowned for revolutionizing the gaming industry, Nvidia's GPUs have now become indispensable in various high-growth sectors, particularly artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia's chips are unmatched in producing processors that power AI systems, including generative AI -- the technology backing OpenAI's ChatGPT, which can create text, images, and other media.\n\nFounded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem in Santa Clara, California, Nvidia launched its first graphics processor, the NV1, in 1995.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2005, Nvidia dominated the gaming graphics market with its GeForce series, including the GeForce 256, the first GPU with an integrated transform and lighting (T&L) engine. This era also saw Nvidia acquire 3dfx, a major competitor in the graphics card market.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2012, Nvidia diversified its offerings, launching the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) for GPU-based parallel computing and the Tesla GPU for high-performance computing. A significant breakthrough came in 2009 with the release of the first Tegra processor, marking Nvidia's entry into the mobile market.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2018, Nvidia shifted focus towards AI and data centres, introducing the Nvidia GRID for GPU virtualization and the Nvidia Drive platform for autonomous vehicles, in partnership with Tesla.\n\nSince 2019, Nvidia has aggressively pursued AI and the metaverse while expanding its data centres. The introduction of the Nvidia A100 Tensor Core GPU and surpassing a $1 trillion market capitalization in 2023 solidified its industry leadership. In 2023, Nvidia's data centre revenue surged by 35 per cent, accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the company's total revenue.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions and Partnerships\n\nStrategic acquisitions have played a crucial role in Nvidia's ascent. The acquisition of Arm Holdings in 2022 for $40 billion was a game-changer. Arm's extensive portfolio of chip designs, widely used in mobile devices and increasingly in IoT and edge computing, provided Nvidia with a massive competitive edge.\n\nMoreover, partnerships with leading companies across various industries have bolstered Nvidia's market position. Collaborations with tech giants like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have ensured that Nvidia's technology remains at the cutting edge of innovation.\n\nNvidia's Financial Might and Market Performance\n\nNvidia's financial performance has been nothing short of spectacular. As of June 19, 2024, Nvidia's market capitalization stood at $3.34 trillion, overtaking Apple, Microsoft, and Saudi Aramco.\n\nNvidia's stock has skyrocketed, delivering a return of over 400 per cent to shareholders over the past three years. The company's shares have risen more than 170 per cent this year and about 1,100 per cent since their October 2022 low.\n\nFor now, Nvidia's earnings are supporting its stock price. Revenue more than tripled to $26 billion in the latest quarter, while net income jumped seven-fold to $14.9 billion.\n\nBlockbuster earnings and broadening investor enthusiasm over AI are supercharging Nvidia's rally. This fervor is reflected in Nvidia's market value, which took only 96 days to rise from $2 trillion to $3 trillion. In comparison, Microsoft took 945 days and Apple took 1,044 days to make the same leap, according to Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nNvidia's impressive financial performance and forecasts have moderated its stock valuation despite the surge in its share price. Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings ratio recently stood at 43, according to LSEG Datastream, higher than the 25 level at the start of the year but below last year's levels. By contrast, the S&P 500 trades at 21 times earnings.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Jeff Chiu/Associated Press file\n\nNvidia's shares rose more than 3% Tuesday, giving the company an overall market valuation of $3.34 trillion. Apple and Microsoft, which for years have swapped positions as the world's most valuable company, were worth slightly less - around $3.29 trillion and $3.31 trillion, respectively, at the end of trading.\n\nNvidia's computer chips and software are crucial to training the AI algorithms behind image generators and chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT. As the tech and business worlds throw themselves into the AI boom, demand for the chips has skyrocketed, pushing Nvidia's revenue up to $26 billion in the first quarter of this year, up from just $7.2 billion a year ago.\n\nThe AI boom has been reshuffling the world's biggest companies in the past two years. In January, Microsoft surged past Apple to become the world's most valuable company as investors have poured money into the hot technology.\n\nNvidia, which was already a large company, has had the \"most remarkable growth story,\" in tech, said Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management.\n\n\"I don't think this is done,\" he said. \"If you believe that AI is going to be as transformative as some believe, this will continue to rise.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia's rise to become the world's most valuable company underlines how strongly investors believe Big Tech executives' claims that AI will overhaul whole swaths of modern life. The technology demands more processing power from computers than other kinds of software, and business leaders are busy building new data centers and filling them with chips from Nvidia and other companies to handle new AI tasks.\n\nProfessional investment funds and individual retail investors alike have thrown their money into Nvidia's shares, pushing up the price even faster than the company's revenue has grown. Since OpenAI kicked off the wave of interest in AI with the launch of ChatGPT at the end of November 2022, Nvidia's stock price has grown about 700%.\n\nNvidia controls about 70% of the market for AI chips, making the company a kingmaker in the industry. That has brought new scrutiny from regulators.\n\nNvidia declined to comment Tuesday.\n\nBefore the AI boom, Nvidia was best known for making computer chips used in video game consoles and computers. But the special characteristics of these \"graphics processing units\" that made them useful for gaming also made them well-suited to crunching the giant calculations needed to train AI algorithms.\n\nIn the mid-2010s, researchers at artificial intelligence labs began using Nvidia GPUs as they tinkered with evermore capable AI. The company took notice and began improving the software used to program its chips to make it more suited to AI work. By the time the AI boom happened, most of the industry was accustomed to using Nvidia's chips and software. Other chip companies, like AMD and Intel, have scrambled to catch up, but industry analysts and AI researchers say Nvidia will continue to benefit from its head start for years.\n\nShira Ovide contributed to this report.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines U.S. antitrust enforcers will investigate leading AI companies Microsoft, Nvidia and OpenAI On Wall Street, Nvidia shares surge amid AI boom, setting off a rally across tech\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nThe Wrap: Camp Pennant brewery launches;

But these multigenerational brand names are now trailing behind Nvidia, suddenly the most-valuable public company in the world.\n\nThe tech behemoth whose prescient decision to launch into AI chipmaking sent its stock into the stratosphere is hardly a household name. Many people can't even pronounce it (it's en-VID-eeyah, the company says on its website).\n\n\"I just read that it is now the world's most valuable company, surpassing Microsoft. Why is that, because what does it do?\" one user posted on Reddit on Tuesday. Many Nvidia investors who hopped on the train likely can't explain what it does either.\n\nWith a market value of over $3 trillion, Nvidia is worth more than most countries' entire economies. How did Nvidia get there?\n\nVideo games were just the start\n\nArtificial intelligence wasn't on the minds of Nvidia's founders when they launched the company 31 years ago over a meal at Denny's, where its CEO Jensen Huang worked at one point as a dishwasher. Their discussion revolved around finding a way to boost the processing capabilities of computers, especially graphics-intensive applications, Huang said in a recent interview that aired on \"60 Minutes.\" That was the impetus for Nvidia entering the graphics processing unit, or GPU, space in 1999.

It's the hottest stock around and the company has a market cap that tops $3.2 trillion.\n\nRead more: California lawmakers are trying to regulate AI before it's too late. Here's how\n\nHere's what to know about the world's leading AI chipmaker:\n\nWhat role is Nvidia playing in the artificial intelligence industry?\n\nArtificial intelligence programs are complex computer applications that rely on massive databases and processing power to produce their results. OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, a much-talked about program released last year that generates text, is estimated to have 1.7 trillion \"parameters,\" or variables, about 10 times more than its 2020 predecessor -- and the complexity is only growing. Nvidia makes a chip called the H100 accelerator that is able to process that data and is in high demand. This month it announced it is making an even more advanced chip.\n\nHas Nvdia always made chips for artificial intelligence?\n\nNvidia went public in 1999 and for years was seen largely as a manufacturer of premium graphics cards sought after by gamers for their clarity in rendering high speed visuals. The cards don't come cheap, with its top of the line GeForce RTX 4090 currently retailing around $1,700. But given its niche position in the industry, Nvidia stock lingered for years under $1 per share, adjusted for stock splits.\n\nWhen did its fortunes improve?\n\nDuring last decade's crypto boom, its powerful chips were sought by \"miners\" of Bitcoin, which employ computer banks to solve puzzles that reward them with cryptocurrency. The demand was so strong Nvidia launched a new chip specifically for miners as its stock surged from 89 cents in May 2016 to more than $7 in October 2018 -- before the crypto bubble burst and shares fell under $4.\n\nThe fall prompted a shareholder lawsuit over accusations that the company hid how much revenue it was making on crypto-related sales. That suit is currently before the Supreme Court.\n\nWhat happened after the collapse of the crypto boom?\n\nNvidia enjoyed a resurgence during the pandemic as Americans confined at home turned to their gaming computers. Its annual revenue shot up more than 50% to $16.7 billion in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2021. The company's cloud computing platform also grew as customers relied on the networks to handle the shift to remote work. Nvidia's stock topped $19 a share in August 2022 before coming back to earth and trading below $12 later in the year as the pandemic waned.\n\nNvidia shares have been on a steady upswing since 2021 as the hype over artificial intelligence has become a frenzy -- supported by the company's strong sales growth. Nvidia's revenue hit $60.9 billion in its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2024. Shares started the year at $48.17 and closed Tuesday at $135.58, a 180% gain that gave it a market value of about $3.34 trillion, briefly surpassing Microsoft.\n\nCan the company keep it up?\n\nNvidia reported record fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $26 billion, up 262% from a year ago, as demand for its chips grew beyond cloud-service providers to include consumer internet companies, governments and automotive and healthcare customers. The company's revenue is projected to grow 44% annually in the near future, according to a FactSet poll of 60 analysts.\n\nWhat other companies are benefiting from AI?\n\nMicrosoft has seen its own stock gain about 20% this year. That's largely due to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft's Bing browser now offers a chat function powered by Chat GPT-4 that can write emails and perform other tasks. Apple stock also hit a record high this week after it announced its Apple Intelligence platform, which will be integrated into its iPhone, iPad, and Mac lineups.\n\nIs a lot of this just hype like crypto?\n\nMany on Wall Street believe that artificial intelligence is in a different league than blockchain and cryptocurrency, with far more concrete applications. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel Corp. are rolling out new chips to counter Nvidia's market dominance.\n\nHowever, there are dissenting voices. Rob Arnott, founder of Newport Beach investment company Research Affiliates, has called Nvidia a great company but warned even last year that its stock performance is unsustainable.\n\n\"Overconfident markets paradoxically transform brilliant future business prospects into even more brilliant current stock price levels,\" Arnott wrote in a research note. \"Nvidia is today's exemplar of that genre: a great company priced beyond perfection.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Earlier this month, Nvidia joined the ranks of tech giants as one of the few US companies to exceed a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nThe chipmaker's stock has surged over the past 18 months, driven by its dominant position in producing processors essential for artificial intelligence systems, including generative AI technologies like OpenAI's ChatGPT, which can create text, images, and other media.\n\nNvidia leads the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, a group of tech giants that have significantly boosted the stock market's returns amid the AI boom on Wall Street. The company's stock has soared approximately 174% this year, making it the best performer in the S&P 500 index for 2023.\n\nThe leadership of CEO Jensen Huang has propelled Nvidia to this milestone, marking a significant shift in the competitive landscape among the most prominent tech companies.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nSince 1 January, 2024, the value of Nvidia has risen by an average of more than $10 billion every single day. To put this figure into perspective, that's more than the current market cap of Reddit - and more than Nvidia was worth just a decade ago.\n\nOn Tuesday, the California-based company became not only the world's most valuable company, but also the most valuable company ever. A new record share price of $136 took its overall market capitalisation above $3.3 trillion - more than the annual GDP of the UK.\n\nThe astonishing rise of the computer chip maker can be pegged, almost to the day, to the release of ChatGPT in late 2022. The artificial intelligence chatbot brought large language models (LLMs) into the public view for the first time, becoming the world's fastest growing app as people realised the potential AI held for everything from drafting work emails, to offering travel tips.\n\nNearly every major tech conference and keynote from that point on has had a heavy focus on AI - Google's most recent developer event mentioned the term more than 120 times during a 110 minute presentation - while demand for the chips that power AI has soared to never-before-seen levels in the tech industry.\n\nFor Nvidia, this artificial intelligence boom coincided with a period of massive market dominance for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential hardware for building and training powerful AI models.\n\nIn taking the top spot of the world's most valuable company, Nvidia surpassed the very same US tech companies that are now pivoting towards AI-centric futures: Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet (Google).\n\nWhile Nvidia's rise can be attributed to the critical role that its chips play in the race to dominate the market for AI, some industry figures have warned that its recent lack of competition in the space may soon be coming to an end.\n\nAs capital pours into the industry, a number of other startups have also entered the space, while existing tech giants like Apple have moved to make their chips in-house.\n\n\"Nvidia's relentless rise to the top of the leader board illustrates a crucial point: powerful hardware is the foundation upon which the AI revolution is built,\" Daniel Bathurst, head of product at AI cloud provider Nscale, told The Independent.\n\n\"As enterprise and start-ups alike bet big on AI, more players are entering this arena and catching up quickly. In this battleground for AI spend, constant innovation is king. But, while powerful chips are a key ingredient, the AI ecosystem is more than just hardware. We need a diverse offering at the chip, hardware, and software level to support a thriving, sustainable AI landscape. As AI continues to develop, collaboration and diverse innovation in every element of the infrastructure will be crucial to unlocking its full potential.\"\n\nThe AI frenzy has helped boost other technology firms, with four of the top five most valuable companies now from the US tech sector.\n\nNvidia's dramatic rise has attracted retail investors and drawn comparisons to pandemic-era meme stocks that saw similarly meteoric gains - followed by inevitable collapses. Yet some analysts believe the semiconductor giant could continue its rally, at least in the short term.\n\nFollowing the company's recent 10-for-1 stock split, Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann increased the share price target for Nvidia from $140 to $200. This would take its market value close to $5 trillion.\n\nThe forecast is based on Nvidia's anticipated earnings for 2026, suggesting that even if other rivals are able to take some of the firm's market share for hardware, its AI software will see Nvidia's gold rush continue.\n\n\"The real narrative lies in the software that complements all the hardware goodness,\" Mosesmann noted.\n\n\"We anticipate this software aspect will significantly increase in the next decade in terms of overall sales mix.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

It's the hottest stock around and the company has a market cap that tops $3.2 trillion.\n\nHere's what to know about the world's leading AI chip maker:\n\nWhat role is Nvidia playing in the artificial intelligence industry?\n\nArtificial intelligence programs are complex computer applications that rely on massive databases and processing power to produce their results. OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, a much-talked about program released last year that generates text, is estimated to have 1.7 trillion \"parameters,\" or variables, about 10 times more than its 2020 predecessor -- and the complexity is only growing. Nvidia makes a chip called the H100 accelerator that is able to process that data and is in high demand. This month it announced it is making an even more advanced chip.\n\nHas Nvdia always made chips for artificial intelligence?\n\nNvidia went public in 1999 and for years was seen largely as a manufacturer of premium graphics cards sought after by gamers for their clarity in rendering high speed visuals. The cards don't come cheap, with its top of the line GeForce RTX 4090 currently retailing around $1,700. But given its niche position in the industry, Nvidia stock lingered for years under $1 per share, adjusted for stock splits.\n\nWhen did its fortunes improve?\n\nDuring last decade's crypto boom, its powerful chips were sought by \"miners\" of Bitcoin, which employ computer banks to solve puzzles that reward them with cryptocurrency. The demand was so strong Nvidia launched a new chip specifically for miners as its stock surged from 89 cents in May 2016 to more than $7 in October 2018 -- before the crypto bubble burst and shares fell under $4.\n\nThe fall prompted a shareholder lawsuit over accusations that the company hid how much revenue it was making on crypto-related sales. That suit is currently before the Supreme Court.\n\nWhat happened after the collapse of the crypto boom?\n\nNvidia enjoyed a resurgence during the pandemic as Americans confined at home turned to their gaming computers. Its annual revenue shot up more than 50% to $16.7 billion in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2021. The company's cloud computing platform also grew as customers relied on the networks to handle the shift to remote work. Nvidia's stock topped $19 a share in August 2022 before coming back to earth and trading below $12 later in the year as the pandemic waned.\n\nWhen did the current stock surge begin?\n\nNvidia shares have been on a steady upswing since 2021 as the hype over artificial intelligence has become a frenzy -- supported by the company's strong sales growth. Nvidia's revenue hit $60.9 billion in its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2024. Shares started the year at $48.17 and closed Tuesday at $135.58, a 180% gain that gave it a market value of about $3.34 trillion, briefly surpassing Microsoft.\n\nCan the company keep it up?\n\nNvidia reported record fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $26 billion, up 262% from a year ago, as demand for its chips grew beyond cloud-service providers to include consumer internet companies, governments and automotive and healthcare customers. The company's revenue is projected to grow 44% annually in the near future, according to a FactSet poll of 60 analysts.\n\nWhat other companies are benefiting from AI?\n\nMicrosoft has seen its own stock gain about 20% this year. That's largely due to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft's Bing browser now offers a chat function powered by Chat GPT-4 that can write emails and perform other tasks. Apple stock also hit a record high this week after it announced its Apple Intelligence platform, which will be integrated into its iPhone, iPad, and Mac lineups.\n\nIs a lot of this just hype like crypto?\n\nMany on Wall Street believe that artificial intelligence is in a different league than blockchain and cryptocurrency, with far more concrete applications. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel Corp. are rolling out new chips to counter Nvidia's market dominance.\n\nHowever, there are dissenting voices. Rob Arnott, founder of Newport Beach investment company Research Affiliates, has called Nvidia a great company but warned even last year that its stock performance is unsustainable.\n\n\"Overconfident markets paradoxically transform brilliant future business prospects into even more brilliant current stock price levels,\" Arnott wrote in a research note. \"Nvidia is today's exemplar of that genre: a great company priced beyond perfection.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Application software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Database"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remote work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Niche market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GeForce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaming computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puzzle video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bitcoin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Associations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Academic Departments", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7429a93/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3660x2059+0+144/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fde%2Fcf%2F52ae62f540a2a8b425df43aac85d%2Fftc-nvidia-arm-47181.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2016-05-", "textStart": 2009, "textEnd": 2017}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 2037, "textEnd": 2049}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

U.S. company with a market cap of $3.27 trillion.\n\nNvidia's shares saw a 3.5% increase on Tuesday, while Microsoft shares dipped by 0.5% and Apple shares fell by 1.1%.\n\nEarlier this month, Nvidia joined the elite group of U.S. companies to reach a $3 trillion market cap, alongside Microsoft and Apple.\n\nThe chipmaker's stock has experienced a meteoric rise over the past year and a half, driven by its unmatched technology in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems.\n\nThese systems include generative AI, the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, capable of creating text, images, and other media.\n\nNvidia leads the pack of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks that have fueled much of the stock market's gains since the AI frenzy gripped Wall Street last

Blackwell will likely replace the company's benchmark H100 chips and drive consistent revenue gains.\n\n\"Right now, we're in an initial investment or research phase of AI, where companies, governments, cloud service providers, etc. are investing in AI and trying to figure out what it can do for them,\" said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds.\n\n\"The hardware providers such as Nvidia are benefiting, and I think there's still some room for this initial phase to run.\"\n\nRelated: Analysts overhaul Nvidia stock price targets as earnings address key problem\n\nNvidia said last month that current-quarter revenue would rise to around $28 billion, with a 2% margin for error, even as it said the Blackwell system of processors and software wouldn't start shipping until the back half of the year.\n\nAnalysts had worried that a gap between the current H100 chips and the new Blackwell offering would create a kind of air pocket in revenue as customers dumped orders for the older chips and waited for the newer system.\n\nGraphics-processing units such as Blackwell are much more efficient than central-processing units, like the H100. So the total cost of ownership for running a data center with Nvidia's GPUs is lower than that of running a data center with CPU servers, said Belton at Gabelli Funds.\n\n\"So, there's a case to be made that the installed base of CPU servers and data centers will need to be replaced by GPUs in the coming years, and there should be ongoing tailwinds for Nvidia from data-center upgrades and data-center modernization,\" he added.\n\nNext stop for Nvidia stock: $4 trillion?\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush, a longtime Nvidia bull, likens its GPUs to \"the new gold or oil in the tech sector,\" which will power a \"fourth Industrial Revolution.\" That revolution, he argues, is already well underway.\n\n\"Its all about the pace of data-center AI-driven spending, as the only game in town for GPUs to run generative-AI applications all go through Nvidia,\" Ives said. \"We believe over the next year the race to $4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft.\"\n\nMore AI Stocks:\n\nNvidia shares were marked 3.4% higher in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $140.19. Such a move would extend the stock's 2024 gain past 210%.\n\nThe group's 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed earlier this month, has also added to speculation that Nvidia could be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Chipmaker Intel (INTC) , valued at $130 billion, is seen as the most likely candidate for replacement.\n\nRelated: Single Best Trade: Wall Street veteran picks Palantir stock", "source": {"uri": "sanluisobispo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_baccardax@sanluisobispo.com", "name": "Martin Baccardax", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_cost_of_ownership", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Total cost of ownership"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/cbq805/picture278706334/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/1cfba229-55f7-44c8-89fe-25809de75a6b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The California-headquartered firm has dethroned Microsoft from the top position and pushed Apple to number 3. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Exxon Mobil, and General Electric are the only companies that have held this title since 2001, according to Dow Jones Market Data. Notably, Nvidia breached the $1 trillion-mark last year.\n\nNvidia is riding high on the artificial intelligence (AI) wave, especially after the advent of the generative AI-based tool ChatGPT in November 2022. On June 18, Nvidia's shares closed at $135.58, growing more than three times its value in June last year. Nvidia is one of the 'Magnificent Seven' US mega stocks, along with Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla and Meta.\n\nNvidia, with its chip series such as A100 and H100 catering to the burgeoning demand for AI processing, was catapulted to market dominance. Last year, the demand for H100 accelerators helped drive Nvidia's sales up by more than 125%. At the annual Nvidia GTC event in March, founder and CEO Jensen Huang unveiled the Blackwell platform. The company claims that it will allow enterprises to build and run real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models at up to 25 times less cost and energy consumption than its predecessor.\n\nIn India, Nvidia has grown in tandem with the global parent and indeed has marginally surpassed it in terms of growth in the last 3-4 financial years, as per information pieced by TechCircle from VCCEdge, a data research platform. Further, in his visit to the country in September last year, Huang acknowledged India's potential, stating, \"You have the data, you have the talent\", emphasising India's potential to become one of the largest AI markets in the world. He also met with the country's premier, researchers, and tech leaders.\n\nTo be sure, Nvidia was founded in 1993 as the maker of graphic processing units (GPU), catering specifically to graphic-intensive applications like gaming.

GPUs can process many tasks simultaneously, making them useful for machine learning, video editing and gaming applications.\n\nSince its inception in 1993, the company has been known for manufacturing computer chips that power graphics-heavy video games. Recently, however, AI laboratories and researchers have started using the same chips to run AI algorithms, thereby disrupting the field.\n\nThis shift quickly drew the attention of investors and technology giants.\n\nCompetition among technology firms and AI developers is intense, with companies like Microsoft, Google's parent Alphabet, Meta, and Apple all striving to create next generation AI products. The fierce competition benefits Nvidia, which not only develops its own AI technology but is also a major player in the AI chip market.\n\nIn the past few quarters, Nvidia sales have jumped as companies such as Meta, Amazon, OpenAI and Microsoft bought its chips.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's stock is one of the best performers in the S&P 500 index, which has jumped more than 15 per cent.\n\nThe California-based company's shares have increased more than 3,477 per cent, from $3.79 to $135.58, in the past five years.\n\nIt has surged by more than 209 per cent and 181 per cent in the past 12 months and since the start of the year, respectively. In comparison, Microsoft and Apple's share have risen 20.3 per cent and 15.4 per cent, respectively, this year.\n\nNvidia overtook Microsoft by market cap on Tuesday. The Redmond-headquartered company's market cap stood at $3.32 trillion at market close on Tuesday, nearly $20 billion less than Nvidia.\n\nNvidia surpassed iPhone maker Apple (market cap $3.29 trillion) earlier this month. Last week, Apple also briefly surpassed Microsoft to trade on the top.\n\nThey are followed by Alphabet ($2.2 trillion), Amazon ($1.9 trillion) and Saudi oil major Aramco ($1.8 trillion).\n\nNvidia's soaring stock price has put Jensen Huang, company's co-founder and chief executive, among the world's wealthiest individuals.\n\nMr Huang's net worth stood at $119 billion, increasing by almost $75 billion since the start of the year, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He is at the 12th spot among the world's richest.\n\nNvidia's AI accelerators, which are chips that assist global companies and data centres in developing AI chatbots, have become highly sought after in recent years.\n\n\"Nvidia finally stole the title of the world's most valuable company ... the catalyst was just a bullish call from an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities who revised his PT [price target] up to $200 from $140 and said that its market cap will reach $5 trillion in the coming year,\" Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said in a note.\n\nIndustry analysts said Nvidia will continue to perform well despite the competitive and changing market conditions.\n\nDespite the mounting competition and the prediction that big tech companies will become more self-reliant in producing their own chips, Nvidia's profitability and outlook suggest that the increasing demand across sectors is likely to offset any challenges faced for the rest of the year, Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com, said.\n\n\"The company's last quarter's numbers [earnings] remain incredibly strong, leaving no doubt that the company's leadership in the AI revolution remains unchallenged for now,\" Mr Monteiro told The National.\n\nNvidia said it expected revenue of $28 billion, plus or minus 2 per cent, in the quarter ending in July, compared to the $26.6 billion forecast by LSEG analysts.\n\nIn the first quarter, which ended on April 28, Nvidia reported revenue of $26.04 billion, up 18 per cent from the previous quarter and up 262 per cent on an annual basis. It exceeded expectations of $24.65 billion.\n\nNet income during the period surged 628 per cent yearly to almost $14.9 billion.\n\nIt was the company's fourth quarter in a row with more than $10 billion in revenue.\n\nNvidia's strong performance in the last quarter was primarily driven by its data centre business that makes chips used to build and run generative AI technology such as ChatGPT.\n\nThe division's first quarter revenue stood at a record $22.6 billion, up 427 per cent from a year ago.\n\nLast month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-one forward stock split, impressing investors and demonstrating that investment in AI computing continues to be robust.\n\nShares started trading on a split-adjusted basis on June 10. Each holder of common stock received nine additional shares of common stock.\n\n\"Nvidia is extremely well placed at least for the next couple of years as demand continues to explode and it seems we are still early in the phase-shift to AI ... It is not easy to compete with them anytime soon,\" Vijay Marolia, chief investment officer at Orlando-based Regal Point Capital management, told The National.\n\n\"Now that the stock has split, I expect more demand from smaller investors ... the stock just needs to increase by a bit over 21 per cent to get the market cap to $4 trillion. I would not be surprised if this happens within 12 months.\"\n\nSplitting stocks is a tactic companies use to make it less expensive to buy individual shares. It does not alter a company's financial fundamentals but attracts retail investors who make small trades.\n\nFollowing Nvidia's rise to the top, the company's global head of business development for telco, Chris Penrose, said the chip maker is working to improve its production and technology as the demand surges.\n\nHe forecast further growth in the industry.\n\n\"The generative AI journey is really transforming businesses and telcos around the world ... we are just at the beginning,\" said Mr Penrose while speaking at an event in Copenhagen.\n\n\"We believe over the next year, the race to $4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and centre between Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft,\" Wedbush Securities said in a note.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news",

The chipmaker is riding the AI wave and is the largest AI GPU supplier with companies like Microsoft and Amazon Web Services (AWS) as its clients. However, if a report is to be believed, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has a growing concern.\n\nThe Information reported that around Christmas last year, Huang discussed a growing concern with company executives in a series of meetings. He was reportedly worried whether its largest buyers have enough space to set up data centres, and if not, they may not buy more.\n\n\"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called a series of meetings with company executives to discuss a growing concern: whether Nvidia's biggest customers were going to run out of data centre space to install its artificial intelligence chips, which could hurt sales,\" the report said, citing a person who attended these meetings.\n\nWhat Nvidia CEO said in employee meetings\n\nAs per the report, the Nvidia's CEO expressed concern to colleagues that cloud giants like AWS and Microsoft - major buyers of Nvidia's AI chips (GPUs) - weren't expanding data centres and power infrastructure fast enough to handle their orders.\n\n\"After the meetings, Nvidia managers stepped up their pace of asking cloud providers whether they had enough space and electricity to accommodate their orders,\" the report cited an employee at Nvidia and several customers and data centre operators, as saying.\n\nHow AI boom is helping Nvidia\n\nSince 2023, Nvidia has been on an upward spiral in the AI space, thanks to its advanced GPUs that are specifically designed for the demanding computations required by generative AI training. Nvidia holds an estimated 80% market share in AI chip manufacturing, and tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet (Google's parent company) as well as OpenAI all rely on Nvidia's hardware.\n\nNvidia is looking for continued growth and recently launched their supercomputing AI GPU, Blackwell.

The company's meteoric rise has been fueled by its industry-leading AI chips.\n\nCNBC reports that Nvidia, a company long known for its graphics chips in the gaming community, has now claimed the top spot as the most valuable public company in the world. On Tuesday, Nvidia's shares climbed 3.6 percent, pushing its market cap to a staggering $3.34 trillion, edging past Microsoft's $3.32 trillion valuation. This milestone comes on the heels of Nvidia's first-time crossing of the $3 trillion mark earlier this month, surpassing Apple in the process.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise has been nothing short of extraordinary, with shares up more than 170 percent year-to-date. The stock's upward trajectory has been fueled by the company's dominant position in the AI chip market, particularly in data centers. Nvidia controls approximately 80 percent of this market, providing the crucial processors needed by tech giants like OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta to build AI models and handle increasingly large workloads.\n\nThe company's first-quarter earnings report in May further solidified its position, with revenue in the data center business skyrocketing by 427 percent year-over-year to $22.6 billion, accounting for a whopping 86 percent of Nvidia's total sales. This impressive growth has not gone unnoticed by Wall Street, which has recognized Nvidia's technology as the driving force behind the ongoing AI explosion.\n\nNvidia's journey to the top has been a transformative one. Founded in 1991, the company initially focused on hardware, primarily selling chips for gamers to run 3D titles. Over the years, it has also ventured into cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions. However, it's the company's pivot towards AI that has catapulted it to new heights, with co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soaring to approximately $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.\n\nRead more at CNBC here.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucas_nolan@breitbart.com", "name": "Lucas Nolan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_gaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud gaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cryptocurrency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Rankings", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Rankings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/06/Jensen-Huang-CEO-of-Nvidia.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Steve Jobs had recently returned to lead Apple. Intel was the dominant force in semiconductors. And a little-known chipmaker named Nvidia made its debut on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nIt took less than three years for Nvidia Corp to ascend into the S&P 500, replacing the disgraced oil-trading conglomerate Enron, no less.\n\nBut even then, few people would have bet that the company would go on to become the best performing stock of the last quarter-century, posting a total return of 591,078% since its initial public offering (IPO), including reinvested dividends.\n\nIt's a difficult number to comprehend and a testament, in part, to the financial mania brewing around artificial intelligence (AI) and how investors have come to see Nvidia, which makes the cutting-edge chips powering the technology, as the single-biggest winner of the boom.\n\nOn Tuesday, that run culminated in Nvidia unseating Microsoft Corp as the world's most valuable company with a market capitalisation of US$3.34 trillion.\n\nThe company's rise was by no means assured, and neither is its staying power at the top of the S&P 500.\n\nLong-time investors in Nvidia have had to stomach three annual collapses of 50% or more in the stock. Sustaining the current rally will require customers to keep spending billions of dollars a quarter on AI equipment, whose returns on investment are so far relatively small.\n\nWhat ultimately paved the way for Nvidia to climb to the top, though, was the company's big bet on graphics chips and the vision of co-founder and chief executive officer Jensen Huang that the industry would shift to what he calls \"accelerated computing\", something his chips are inherently better at than the competition.\n\n\"You have to give the management team, I think, an enormous amount of credit,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management.\n\n\"They have caught each wave of innovation in hardware perfectly well.\"\n\nHere's a look at Nvidia from its IPO to now.\n\nEarly Years: Nvidia got off to a hot start. Between its debut and the time it entered the S&P 500, the stock gained more than 1,600%, giving it a market value of about US$8billion.\n\nThat rise came as many other technology stocks were cratering in the aftermath of the dot-com bubble, which peaked in March 2000.\n\nThe company's key to early success was getting its technology in video game consoles like Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation.\n\nNvidia's GeForce graphics processing units (GPUs) became objects of desire among gamers because they consistently offered the most realistic experience.\n\n\"Jensen was always a great communicator, told a good story and clearly GPUs were becoming more important,\" said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management, who was a buyer in the IPO.\n\n\"Each successive generation of hardware gave a lot better performance, a lot more realistic picture and then personal computer gaming really came into being.\"\n\nLitigation and competition: The next six years weren't kind to Nvidia. The stock plunged in 2008 as the financial crisis weakened demand and long-struggling rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc started turning things around.\n\nMeanwhile, an agreement between Nvidia and Intel that allowed the companies to use each other's capabilities went sour, forcing Nvidia out of one of its biggest markets.\n\nThe two settled in 2011, with Intel agreeing to pay Nvidia US$1.5bil.\n\nThe following year, Nvidia unveiled graphics chips for servers inside data centres.\n\nThey could help sophisticated computing work such as oil and gas exploration and weather prediction, giving Nvidia a foothold in what would become a lucrative market.\n\nHowever, those chips did not immediately fly off the shelf. It would take nearly nine years for Nvidia shares to surpass their 2007 high.\n\nCrypto and Covid: Nvidia shares took off again in 2015.\n\nDuring that period, the company's chips were becoming the foundation of emerging technologies, from advanced graphics interfaces to autonomous vehicles to a new wave of AI products.\n\nThat's when Shana Sissel, chief executive officer at Banrion Capital Management, first really took note of the company. She described a 2017 conference where Nvidia was more like a pageant winner than an investment idea.\n\n\"Every single speaker talked about Nvidia being the most important company,\" Sissel said. \"At that point, it was really on my radar.\"\n\nEven after demand from cryptocurrency miners dried up, data-centre sales continued to grow.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic boosted that business, as companies needed to purchase additional computing power to support remote work.\n\nNvidia's data-centre revenue rose by a multiple of eight from the financial year 2017 to 2021.\n\nAI sales explode: Nvidia's shares slumped in 2022 along with the rest of the technology sector, which was reeling from soaring interest rates and falling demand after the Covid-era boom.\n\nOpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late-2022 made an instant splash but it took time for investors to realise how Nvidia might benefit. Eventually, interest in ChatGPT and other generative AI products exploded, triggering a frantic surge in orders for Nvidia's chips.\n\nWhen the company reported first quarter 2023 earnings, the scale of the jump in its business shocked nearly everyone on Wall Street.\n\nNvidia gave a forecast for quarterly sales that was more than 50% above the average projection.\n\nNvidia's data centre sales eclipsed its gaming revenue for the first time in the financial year 2023. In Nvidia's current financial year, analysts expect those sales to top US$100bil.\n\n\"They have a very defensible place in the industry,\" said Williams, the strategist at Wayve Capital Management.\n\n\"They're not gonna be 95% of market share forever, obviously, but it would be almost impossible for anybody to replace them.\" -- Bloomberg", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my",

On Monday, Nvidia shares rose by more than 3.5%, pushing the company's market value to an unprecedented level of $3.335 trillion. Although the value slightly decreased to $3.334 trillion on Tuesday, Nvidia's market cap remains an impressive testament to its dominance in the technology industry.\n\nThe company's meteoric rise has been nothing short of phenomenal. By February, Nvidia's market cap had increased from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in just nine months, and it took just over three months to reach $3 trillion by June. This growth trajectory highlights Nvidia's strategic position as a leader in the chip manufacturing sector, particularly benefiting from the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence across various industries.\n\nAlso Read: EPFO Adds 18.92 Lakh Members In April, Highest Since 2018\n\nWith a market capitalization of $3.334 trillion as of June 18, Nvidia has surpassed the GDP of many countries. According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) data as of June 19, only six countries boast a GDP higher than Nvidia's market capitalization:\n\nThis comparison underscores the extraordinary scope of Nvidia's financial valuation, which now exceeds the total economic output of major countries such as France, Brazil, and Canada. This growth is largely due to the development and integration of artificial intelligence, an area in which Nvidia continues to lead with cutting-edge chip technology.\n\nAs industries globally continue to embrace AI, Nvidia stands to gain further, which could further increase its market value. The company's current valuation reflects not only its technological prowess but also the growing demand for AI solutions across all sectors.\n\nNvidia's rise to become the world's most valuable company signifies a new era in which technology companies, especially those specializing in artificial intelligence, are becoming central to the global economy, often rivaling the economic output of entire countries.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/06/20/article/image/Nvidia-1718890174904.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1031, "textEnd": 1038}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 1146, "textEnd": 1153}], "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

How did Nvidia get there?\n\nVideo games were just the start\n\nArtificial intelligence wasn't on the minds of Nvidia's founders when they launched the company 31 years ago over a meal at Denny's, where its CEO Jensen Huang worked at one point as a dishwasher. Their discussion revolved around finding a way to boost the processing capabilities of computers, especially graphics-intensive applications, Huang said in a recent interview that aired on \"60 Minutes.\" That was the impetus for Nvidia entering the graphics processing unit, or GPU, space in 1999. (While Nvidia popularized the term, it didn't invent it, though it is often mistakenly credited with having done so.)\n\nNvidia's GPUs revolutionized the gaming industry, bringing to market new games with movie-like visuals, whereas prior games were 2-D.\n\nEventually, the company took things one step further, creating a programming language that enabled developers to create applications to run on its hardware. By 2012, it discovered that its chips could be used to power much, much more than video games, chief among those: artificial intelligence applications.\n\nStill, the company remained relatively obscure to most investors and consumers -- except for hardcore PC gamers.\n\nThat all changed in November 2022, when OpenAI announced ChatGPT, which shocked the world, permanently altering people's understanding of AI's capabilities. The app's stunning ability to mimic human speech and perform complex tasks shook Silicon Valley and Wall Street.\n\nThe winning ingredient (for now)\n\nSuppose everyone collectively at the same time decided they don't want to commute to work by driving or using mass transit. Instead, everyone is going to bike to work from here on out. Well, naturally demand for bikes is going to explode overnight. Want to get in on the action and start making bikes? You're going to need a lot of steel. Nvidia is the steel of AI.\n\nNow that just about every company, tech or not, is trying to find some way to use AI after OpenAI's success made them look silly in comparison, everyone needs a lot of Nvidia.\n\nIt's no wonder why it was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2023, gaining a whopping 239%. Up an additional 181% so far this year, it's been the best-performing again.\n\nAll that demand for Nvidia chips surely must've increased competition, right?\n\nSlowly but surely it has with heavyweights like Meta, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft starting to play catch-up. However, none of them are coming close to Nvidia's capabilities in the AI space, which is why it controls upwards of 70% of the market in AI chips.\n\nWall Street's love affair with AI doesn't seem like it'll ever end. Could it all be one big bubble that's bound to burst like the dot-com era? Maybe, but it seems less likely given the intrinsic value AI carries. All that means is demand for Nvidia chips isn't going away any time soon but that competition will continue to grow more fierce.\n\nBefore we know it, another company with a name most people can't pronounce will be referred to as the next Nvidia.\n\n5 emerging trends that will change how you use your phone in 2024 What to watch for Augmented reality integration AI technology Expanded biometric

Aside from a few brief incursions, Apple (AAPL)has been the world's biggest company between 2011 and 2023. Earlier this year, it lost the title to Microsoft (MSFT), but dislodged the Windows maker to reclaim the crown early last week, following its stellar rally after the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\n\nHowever, stock markets experienced their \"flippening\" of sorts on Tuesday - a term used to describe the hypothetical situation where Ethereum (ETHUSD) replaces Bitcoin (BTCUSD) as the biggest cryptocurrency - when Nvidia (NVDA) surpassed both Big Tech giants to become the world's most valuable company.\n\nNvidia Surpassed Microsoft to Become the World's Biggest Company\n\nNvidia has been a remarkable wealth creator for investors, with its stock up over 79,000% (and no, that's not a typo!) over the last 20 years. Just a couple of years back, not too many would have given the Jensen Huang-led company any realistic chance of becoming the world's biggest company - and by 2024, no less.\n\nHowever, Nvidia has seen a major rerating with the artificial intelligence (AI) pivot. The company's chips form the bedrock of large language models (LLMs) that multiple companies - including tech giants like Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG) - are building.\n\nMeanwhile, amid the continued rally in Nvidia, recovery in Apple, and continued strength in Microsoft, we now have three companies running neck-and-neck for the crown of the world's biggest company. Here's the forecast for these three $3 trillion behemoths, and a look at which company could retain the title by the end of 2024.\n\nApple Stock Forecast\n\nApple is currently trading above its mean target price of $206.96. As I noted in a previous article, the anomaly is largely due to the majority of analysts not yet refreshing their target prices after the WWDC announcements.\n\nHowever, sell-side analysts have been gradually ramping up their target prices. Recently, Bank of America analyst Samik Chatterjee raised his price target from $225 to $245. Apple's Street-high target price is $275 - which, if hit, would mean the company's market cap rising to $4.2 billion over the next year.\n\nRosenblatt Expects Nvidia's Market Cap to Rise to Almost $5 Trillion\n\nAnalysts covering Nvidia stock have been a busy group - and quite literally so - as they have had to raise their target prices frequently amid the spectacular rise in NVDA stock.\n\nLike Apple, Nvidia is also trading above its consensus target price. Notably, NVDA stock has often traded above its mean target price over the last year, as analysts have been trying to play catch-up with its price action.\n\nThe stock's new Street-high target price of $200 (via Rosenblatt) implies the chip designing company's market cap soaring to almost $5 trillion. Fellow Barchart analyst Mark R. Hake, CFA also believes that NVDA stock could be worth $200 based on its free cash flows.\n\nHow High Can Microsoft Stock Go?\n\nUnlike Nvidia and Apple, both of which trade above their mean target prices, Microsoft's mean target price of $492.71 is 10.4% higher than Tuesday's closing prices. The stock's Street-high target price of $600 is 34.4% higher, and if hit, would place the Redmond-based company's market cap at nearly $4.5 trillion.\n\nIn terms of valuations, though, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia all trade at a premium to their average 3-year forward price-to-earnings (PE) multiples.\n\nWhich Tech Giant Will Be the Biggest Company by the End of 2024?\n\nAs things stand currently, all three of these names are in contention to be the biggest company by market cap by the end of 2024. It should be a close race, and Wedbush believes that \"over the next year the race to $4 Trillion Market Cap in Tech will be front and center\" between NVDA, MSFT, and AAPL.\n\nDeepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster, however, believes that Apple will outperform Nvidia over the next year. While the noted tech analyst termed Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang as the \"godfather of AI,\" he emphasized, \"Investors are largely in denial about what Apple's AI opportunity is going to be.\"\n\nThe race is wide open, and while the momentum might lie with Nvidia, some analysts are advising caution after its breathtaking rally, which refuses to die down. As Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York, said, \"Nvidia has been getting a lot of positive attention and has been doing a lot of things very correctly, but a small misstep is likely to cause a major correction in the stock, and investors should be careful.\"\n\nAs for Apple, the company needs to show markets that its \"Apple Intelligence\" can really fuel the iPhone replacement supercycle that many analysts are predicting.\n\nMicrosoft also has multiple opportunities to capitalize on the AI pivot. These include the expected PC refresh driven by AI-enabled gadgets, growth in cloud and other software services, and market share gains in the online search market led by its partnership with ChatGPT.\n\nOverall, I believe that we could see a tough fight between Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia for the numero uno spot as markets weigh how all three companies will benefit from round 2 of the AI pivot.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score":

This leap was catalyzed by robust demand from partners like Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer, which saw their shares rise by 3.8% and 4.8% respectively. On social media platform X, Elon Musk revealed that these partners are supplying server racks for xAI's supercomputer, used to train AI models like Grok. Impressively, the latest model's training required around 20,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, with future versions expected to need roughly 100,000 Nvidia chips. Benefiting exclusively from AI revenues, Nvidia's stock has nearly tripled in 2024, significantly boosting overall market gains. Super Micro's shares also tripled while Dell's stock gained almost 95%. This success is mirrored by the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, which hit a lifetime high after climbing nearly 34% since April.\n\nNvidia's exclusive profit generation from AI sets it apart, as highlighted by the CEO of Longbow Asset Management. Unlike Microsoft, which balances spending and earning in AI, Nvidia thrives solely on its AI revenues. This dynamic is bolstering confidence in Nvidia and related tech stocks, making AI-centric companies promising prospects for investors seeking substantial returns.\n\nThe bigger picture: Tech giants reshaping the future.\n\nThe rapid ascent of Nvidia underscores the transformative impact of AI on the global economy. As companies devote resources to harnessing AI's potential, the overall market landscape is set to evolve, with tech giants leading the charge. International policies and investments will likely shift to support this growing sector, driving advancements and competition in the AI arena.", "source": {"uri": "finimize.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finimize"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Technologies", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dell Technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "19-inch rack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fdefault_prefix-img-P40Fk7zpWZ8Zmgq6Pa5TbEgX.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=0c1387ab8ec949726d4feb94d28fcee6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5529411764705883, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Few companies have benefited more than hardware giants like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), which supply the data center equipment needed to support this fast-growing industry.\n\nBusiness is booming, and both companies have turned to stock splits to keep their shares liquid and available to smaller investors. Let's explore the long-term prospects of both companies while acknowledging the potential challenges they may face in the near term.\n\nAfter seeing its shares rise over 3,500% in just five years, it's no surprise that Nvidia relies on frequent stock splits to keep its share price under control. The most recent was a 10-for-1 split, effective as of June 7, that brought its stock to around $120 per share. And with the artificial intelligence industry in its early innings, Nvidia is still a long-term winner.\n\nThere is no shortage of grandiose projections for the future of AI. Bloomberg Intelligence believes the industry could be worth a whopping $1.3 trillion by 2032. And with an 80% market share in the advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to power the large language models, Nvidia undeniably has a bright future from a demand perspective.\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 51, Nvidia's shares are also fairly valued relative to growth. First-quarter revenue increased 262% year over year to $26 billion while net income surged 628% to $14.9 billion.\n\nThat said, every new industry experiences growing pains. And with 87% of Nvidia's sales coming from data center hardware, the company is exceptionally vulnerable to any near-term slowdown in AI chip demand, even if its long-term future remains bright.\n\nWith an unusually high stock price of $1,735 per share, Broadcom seemed overdue for a split when it announced a 10-for-1 swap expected to go live on July 15. Like Nvidia, the company's stock has soared amid rising AI hardware demand. However, its lower valuation and more diversified revenue streams could make it a safer way to bet on this opportunity.\n\nWhile Nvidia is known for its general-purpose AI chips, Broadcom specializes in custom chips designed for its client's specific workloads. This niche allows its hardware to be more cost- and energy-efficient than mass-market alternatives. And business is booming.\n\nSecond-quarter revenue jumped 43% year over year to $12.5 billion, helped by rising AI-related demand and the recent acquisition of VMware, a cloud computing company focused on virtual machines, which can run apps on software instead of physical computers. VMware helps diversify Broadcom into many different sides of the tech industry, shielding it from a potential slowdown in demand for AI chips.\n\nWith a P/E multiple of 37, Broadcom is also reasonably priced compared to Nvidia, which trades for 51 times forward earnings, even though the latter company seems to have better growth prospects.\n\nWhile stock splits can create the illusion of affordability, they often can indicate the opposite. A stock split usually occurs after a company has already experienced extreme price appreciation. So, new investors aren't exactly getting a bargain deal. That said, over the long term, Nvidia and Broadcom still have what it takes to outperform the market.\n\nIn the near term, investors should consider the potential for volatility as the AI industry experiences its growing pains, just like the internet and other megatrends did historically. But between the two companies, Broadcom looks like the safer bet because of its lower valuation and greater diversification.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The company's GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are integral to Al applications, offering unparalleled performance and efficiency for deep learning and machine learning tasks.\n\nThis technological edge has made Nvidia the go-to provider for Al hardware in industries ranging from healthcare to autonomous vehicles.\n\nLately, the company achieved a remarkable by becoming the new tech titan after it overtook Microsoft in market valuation to become the most valuable public company in the world at $3.335 trillion. This is coming only about two weeks after it surpassed iPhone maker Apple to become the world's second most valuable company.\n\nNvidia's meteoric rise to the top has been incredibly fast, with the company's value surging from $1 trillion to $2 trillion in the space of only nine months to February this year. Incredibly, the jump from $2 trillion to over $3 trillion has taken a mere four months, with the company surpassing all expected revenue figures.\n\nFROM GAMING TO AI: NVIDIA'S FOCUS SHIFT\n\nNvidia, known for its chips used in video games, pivoted to the data center market over the last few years. The company's business rapidly expanded during the pandemic when gaming took off, cloud adoption surged and crypto enthusiasts turned to its chips for mining coins. The data center chip business accounted for more than 50% of the company's revenue in the financial year ended Jan. 29.\n\nToday, the company has become a powerhouse as it continues to innovate and expand its influence in AI. It is interesting to note that before the rise of Nvidia, tech company Intel was already in the market for making both CPUs and GPUs, as well as manufacturing its semiconductors.\n\nBut after a series of missteps, including not investing in the development of Al chips soon enough, the rival chipmaker's preeminence faded. In 2019, when Nvidia's market value was just over the $100 billion mark, Intel's value was double that; now Nvidia has joined the ranks of tech titans designated the \"Magnificent Seven\".\n\nToday Nvidia's four main markets are gaming, professional visualization, data centers, and the automotive industry, as it provides chips that train self-driving technology.\n\nNvidia's success has been marked by three key factors which are; partnerships with leading tech companies intensive AI research and development, and expansion into new markets.\n\nPartnerships with Leading Tech Companies:\n\nNvidia has forged partnerships with leading technology companies and research institutions to further Al's innovation. Collaborations with firms like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have enabled the integration of Nvidia's Al solutions into cloud services, expanding their reach and accessibility.\n\nAl Research and Development:\n\nNvidia continues to invest heavily in Al research and development, contributing to significant breakthroughs in the field. The company's research efforts are focused on advancing Al algorithms, optimizing hardware performance, and exploring new applications of Al technology.\n\nExpansion into New Markets:\n\nNvidia's foray into new markets such as autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and finance has diversified its revenue streams. The company's Al technology is being utilized to develop self-driving cars, improve medical diagnostics, and enhance financial services, showcasing its versatility and broad application potential.\n\nIt's undeniable that Nvidia put in the investment into the Al industry well before others started paying attention. Several financial analysts and industry experts have expressed wariness over Nvidia's valuation, predicting that Al's enthusiasm will slow down.\n\nHowever, Nvidia's commitment to AI innovation positions it for sustainable growth and leadership in the sector.

Earlier this year, it lost the title to Microsoft (MSFT), but dislodged the Windows maker to reclaim the crown early last week, following its stellar rally after the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC).\n\nHowever, stock markets experienced their \"flippening\" of sorts on Tuesday - a term used to describe the hypothetical situation where Ethereum (ETHUSD) replaces Bitcoin (BTCUSD) as the biggest cryptocurrency - when Nvidia (NVDA) surpassed both Big Tech giants to become the world's most valuable company.\n\nNvidia Surpassed Microsoft to Become the World's Biggest Company\n\nNvidia has been a remarkable wealth creator for investors, with its stock up over 79,000% (and no, that's not a typo!) over the last 20 years. Just a couple of years back, not too many would have given the Jensen Huang-led company any realistic chance of becoming the world's biggest company - and by 2024, no less.\n\nHowever, Nvidia has seen a major rerating with the artificial intelligence (AI) pivot. The company's chips form the bedrock of large language models (LLMs) that multiple companies - including tech giants like Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG) - are building.\n\nMeanwhile, amid the continued rally in Nvidia, recovery in Apple, and continued strength in Microsoft, we now have three companies running neck-and-neck for the crown of the world's biggest company. Here's the forecast for these three $3 trillion behemoths, and a look at which company could retain the title by the end of 2024.\n\nApple Stock Forecast\n\nApple is currently trading above its mean target price of $206.96. As I noted in a previous article, the anomaly is largely due to the majority of analysts not yet refreshing their target prices after the WWDC announcements.\n\nHowever, sell-side analysts have been gradually ramping up their target prices. Recently, Bank of America analyst Samik Chatterjee raised his price target from $225 to $245. Apple's Street-high target price is $275 - which, if hit, would mean the company's market cap rising to $4.2 billion over the next year.\n\nRosenblatt Expects Nvidia's Market Cap to Rise to Almost $5 Trillion\n\nAnalysts covering Nvidia stock have been a busy group - and quite literally so - as they have had to raise their target prices frequently amid the spectacular rise in NVDA stock.\n\nLike Apple, Nvidia is also trading above its consensus target price. Notably, NVDA stock has often traded above its mean target price over the last year, as analysts have been trying to play catch-up with its price action.\n\nThe stock's new Street-high target price of $200 (via Rosenblatt) implies the chip designing company's market cap soaring to almost $5 trillion. Fellow Barchart analyst Mark R. Hake, CFA also believes that NVDA stock could be worth $200 based on its free cash flows.\n\nHow High Can Microsoft Stock Go?\n\nUnlike Nvidia and Apple, both of which trade above their mean target prices, Microsoft's mean target price of $492.71 is 10.4% higher than Tuesday's closing prices. The stock's Street-high target price of $600 is 34.4% higher, and if hit, would place the Redmond-based company's market cap at nearly $4.5 trillion.\n\nIn terms of valuations, though, Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia all trade at a premium to their average 3-year forward price-to-earnings (PE) multiples.\n\nWhich Tech Giant Will Be the Biggest Company by the End of 2024?\n\nAs things stand currently, all three of these names are in contention to be the biggest company by market cap by the end of 2024. It should be a close race, and Wedbush believes that \"over the next year the race to $4 Trillion Market Cap in Tech will be front and center\" between NVDA, MSFT, and AAPL.\n\nDeepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster, however, believes that Apple will outperform Nvidia over the next year. While the noted tech analyst termed Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang as the \"godfather of AI,\" he emphasized, \"Investors are largely in denial about what Apple's AI opportunity is going to be.\"\n\nThe race is wide open, and while the momentum might lie with Nvidia, some analysts are advising caution after its breathtaking rally, which refuses to die down. As Oliver Pursche, senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in New York, said, \"Nvidia has been getting a lot of positive attention and has been doing a lot of things very correctly, but a small misstep is likely to cause a major correction in the stock, and investors should be careful.\"\n\nAs for Apple, the company needs to show markets that its \"Apple Intelligence\" can really fuel the iPhone replacement supercycle that many analysts are predicting.\n\nMicrosoft also has multiple opportunities to capitalize on the AI pivot. These include the expected PC refresh driven by AI-enabled gadgets, growth in cloud and other software services, and market share gains in the online search market led by its partnership with ChatGPT.\n\nOverall, I believe that we could see a tough fight between Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia for the numero uno spot as markets weigh how all three companies will benefit from round 2 of the AI pivot.\n\nOn the date of publication, Mohit Oberoi had a position in: AAPL , MSFT , GOOG , AMZN , NVDA , META .

Back then, there was an up-and-coming chip company called Nvidia (NVDA 3.51%), with graphics processors that were popular in video game applications.\n\nThings weren't bad, as video games were a growth industry, though cyclical. But 2014 was a tough year. In fact, in the second quarter of that year, Nvidia posted a revenue decline.\n\nWith those types of results, investors might have viewed Nvidia as an already-mature company. But those looking more deeply might have learned of Nvidia's new software platform called CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), which enabled Nvidia graphics chips to execute data processing in a parallel format. That meant many calculations could be executed simultaneously, whereas CPUs calculated data in a linear fashion.\n\nSome hypothesized that CUDA-enabled GPUs would one day overtake the mighty CPU as the main type of data center computing processor. Had one placed a modest $1,000 bet on that scenario, here's how much you would have made.\n\nA modest $1,000 investment in Nvidia in June of 2014 would have grown (dividends included) to a stunning $280,600 today! That's a 280-bagger, amounting to a 27,960% gain.\n\nTwo things happened. The capabilities of generative artificial intelligence technology became apparent following the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022 and Nvidia's GPUs became the best way to execute the massive number of calculations needed to train these models. As a result, enterprises began falling over themselves to buy these coveted chips.\n\nThat sent Nvidia's revenue up 262% last quarter to $26 billion, with net margin surging to 58.5%. For reference, in Q2 2014, Nvidia made just $977 million in revenue, with adjusted (non-GAAP) net margins of 13.6%.\n\nAs Nvidia shows, investing in just one incredible growth stock early on can make up for dozens of mediocre stock picks and make a huge difference to your financial security and independence. While not many stocks will turn into the next Nvidia, the \"next Nvidia\" could be out there waiting to be uncovered in the market today.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "billy_duberstein@fool.com", "name": "Billy Duberstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CUDA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computing platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/781018/gettyimages-1061700868.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

How did Nvidia get there?\n\nVideo games were just the start\n\nArtificial intelligence wasn't on the minds of Nvidia's founders when they launched the company 31 years ago over a meal at Denny's, where its CEO Jensen Huang worked at one point as a dishwasher. Their discussion revolved around finding a way to boost the processing capabilities of computers, especially graphics-intensive applications, Huang said in a recent interview that aired on \"60 Minutes.\" That was the impetus for Nvidia entering the graphics processing unit, or GPU, space in 1999. (While Nvidia popularized the term, it didn't invent it, though it is often mistakenly credited with having done so.)\n\nNvidia's GPUs revolutionized the gaming industry, bringing to market new games with movie-like visuals, whereas prior games were 2-D.\n\nEventually, the company took things one step further, creating a programming language that enabled developers to create applications to run on its hardware. By 2012, it discovered that its chips could be used to power much, much more than video games, chief among those: artificial intelligence applications.\n\nStill, the company remained relatively obscure to most investors and consumers -- except for hardcore PC gamers.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThat all changed in November 2022, when OpenAI announced ChatGPT, which shocked the world, permanently altering people's understanding of AI's capabilities. The app's stunning ability to mimic human speech and perform complex tasks shook Silicon Valley and Wall Street.\n\nThe winning ingredient (for now)\n\nSuppose everyone collectively at the same time decided they don't want to commute to work by driving or using mass transit. Instead, everyone is going to bike to work from here on out. Well, naturally demand for bikes is going to explode overnight. Want to get in on the action and start making bikes? You're going to need a lot of steel. Nvidia is the steel of AI.\n\nNow that just about every company, tech or not, is trying to find some way to use AI after OpenAI's success made them look silly in comparison, everyone needs a lot of Nvidia.\n\nIt's no wonder why it was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2023, gaining a whopping 239%. Up an additional 181% so far this year, it's been the best-performing again.\n\nAll that demand for Nvidia chips surely must've increased competition, right?\n\nSlowly but surely it has with heavyweights like Meta, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft starting to play catch-up. However, none of them are coming close to Nvidia's capabilities in the AI space, which is why it controls upwards of 70% of the market in AI chips.\n\nWall Street's love affair with AI doesn't seem like it'll ever end. Could it all be one big bubble that's bound to burst like the dot-com era? Maybe, but it seems less likely given the intrinsic value AI carries. All that means is demand for Nvidia chips isn't going away any time soon but that competition will continue to grow more fierce.\n\nBefore we know it, another company with a name most people can't

How did Nvidia get there?\n\nVideo games were just the start\n\nArtificial intelligence wasn't on the minds of Nvidia's founders when they launched the company 31 years ago over a meal at Denny's, where its CEO Jensen Huang worked at one point as a dishwasher. Their discussion revolved around finding a way to boost the processing capabilities of computers, especially graphics-intensive applications, Huang said in a recent interview that aired on \"60 Minutes.\" That was the impetus for Nvidia entering the graphics processing unit, or GPU, space in 1999. (While Nvidia popularized the term, it didn't invent it, though it is often mistakenly credited with having done so.)\n\nNvidia's GPUs revolutionized the gaming industry, bringing to market new games with movie-like visuals, whereas prior games were 2-D.\n\nEventually, the company took things one step further, creating a programming language that enabled developers to create applications to run on its hardware. By 2012, it discovered that its chips could be used to power much, much more than video games, chief among those: artificial intelligence applications.\n\nStill, the company remained relatively obscure to most investors and consumers -- except for hardcore PC gamers.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThat all changed in November 2022, when OpenAI announced ChatGPT, which shocked the world, permanently altering people's understanding of AI's capabilities. The app's stunning ability to mimic human speech and perform complex tasks shook Silicon Valley and Wall Street.\n\nThe winning ingredient (for now)\n\nSuppose everyone collectively at the same time decided they don't want to commute to work by driving or using mass transit. Instead, everyone is going to bike to work from here on out. Well, naturally demand for bikes is going to explode overnight. Want to get in on the action and start making bikes? You're going to need a lot of steel. Nvidia is the steel of AI.\n\nNow that just about every company, tech or not, is trying to find some way to use AI after OpenAI's success made them look silly in comparison, everyone needs a lot of Nvidia.\n\nIt's no wonder why it was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2023, gaining a whopping 239%. Up an additional 181% so far this year, it's been the best-performing again.\n\nAll that demand for Nvidia chips surely must've increased competition, right?\n\nSlowly but surely it has with heavyweights like Meta, Amazon, IBM and Microsoft starting to play catch-up. However, none of them are coming close to Nvidia's capabilities in the AI space, which is why it controls upwards of 70% of the market in AI chips.\n\nWall Street's love affair with AI doesn't seem like it'll ever end. Could it all be one big bubble that's bound to burst like the dot-com era? Maybe, but it seems less likely given the intrinsic value AI carries. All that means is demand for Nvidia chips isn't going away any time soon but that competition will continue to grow more fierce.\n\nBefore we know it, another company with a name most people can't

Nvidia's share price has rocketed in the last 18 months - in January 2023 it stood at less than $15, and it's currently at $135, making the company worth $3.34 trillion.\n\nThe company has successfully ridden the wave of generative AI that has swept through the tech industry during this period because it provides the fundamental building blocks needed by every AI company - the immensely powerful GPUs they need to build and run AI models.\n\nIn any gold rush it's the sellers of the picks and shovels that make the most money, and in the AI rush the equivalent is the high-performance chips and infrastructure around them provided by Nvidia.\n\nOn its most recent earnings call, Nvidia gave some idea of the scale of the investment being made by big tech companies in training and running large language models (LLMs).\n\nBig AI players from OpenAI and Anthropic through to DeepMind and Meta are all building on Nvidia. Tesla's expansion of its training AI cluster, for example, features 35,000 H100 GPUs, while Meta trained Llama 3, its latest LLM, on a cluster of 24,000 H100 GPUs.\n\nWhile the pricing of these GPUs varies, they can easily run into tens of thousands of dollars each, which goes a long way to explain why Nvidia shares are riding so high.\n\nNvidia said clusters like the ones built by Meta and Tesla are examples of what it describes as 'AI factories', next-generation data centers \"where the data comes in and intelligence comes out\".\n\nIn the first quarter of its financial year, Nvidia revealed it was working with over 100 customers building AI factories, ranging in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs and with some even reaching 100,000 GPUs in scale.\n\nBut what is perhaps also fueling the continued growth in Nvidia's share price is the belief that the impact of AI is just beginning.\n\nMuch of the AI spending right now is limited to the hyperscalers and tech companies themselves, but there are other big markets on the horizon too.\n\nEnterprises will want to start building AI capabilities to build on their own vast (and often ignored) stores of corporate data. And Nvidia also foresees the rise of 'sovereign AI' whereby nations start to build up their own domestic AI offerings built on their own infrastructure and data.\n\nThe chip company expects sovereign AI alone to be a high single-digit billion business this year - and some major industry players are already cashing in on this idea.\n\nEarlier this year, Oracle CTO and chairman Larry Ellison said he expects a widespread shift toward national sovereign cloud setups in the coming years as governments accelerate efforts to keep data in-country.\n\nGPUs also continue to get more powerful, further fueling enterprise appetite and therefore Nvidia's success. The first H200 system has already been delivered to OpenAI and powered their GPT-4o demos, for example.\n\nThe H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100. After this comes the Blackwell GPU architecture which will push AI performance even further.\n\nThe Blackwell GPU architecture should offer four times faster training and 30 times faster inference than the H100 - and real-time generative AI on trillion-parameter large language models, the company said.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that demand for H200 and Blackwell is \"well ahead\" of supply, and that it expects demand may exceed supply well into next year.\n\n\"The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible. We're racing actually,\" Huang told investors on the firm's most recent earnings call.\n\nIn some respects, the rise of Nvidia has echoes of the rise of networking giant Cisco in the years of the dotcom boom (that also involved leapfrogging Microsoft).\n\nNvidia's rise is tied to the rise of AI just as Cisco's rise was tied to the excitement around the rise of the internet. And as the excitement continues, few tech companies will want to miss out, which means that strong demand for GPUs is likely to continue.\n\nBut Huang argued on the call there is a more profound change ahead, adding that AI is redesigning how computers work.\n\n\"The computer is no longer an instruction-driven-only computer,\" he said. \"It's an intention-understanding computer. And it understands, of course, the way we interact with it, but it also understands our meaning, what we intend that we asked it to do. And it has the ability to reason, inference iteratively to process a plan, and come back with a solution,\" he said.\n\n\"And so, that's going to change computing stacks all over the world.\"", "source": {"uri": "itpro.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITProUK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_ranger@itpro.com", "name": "Steve Ranger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DeepMind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Larry Ellison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ArpauzNMyUbS8Thzao8fpK-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

A 13F provides a snapshot to investors of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors have been buying and selling. It's effectively a blueprint that allows investors to see what stocks, industries, and trends have been piquing the interest of top-tier money managers.\n\nAs should be no surprise, first-quarter 13Fs showed a lot of trading activity in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nCompanies involved in AI are using software and systems to handle tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. What gives AI such broad-reaching utility is the ability for software and AI-driven systems to learn without human intervention. This evolution of AI systems should improve efficiency and allow for new tasks to be learned.\n\nDespite the big-dollar potential associated with AI -- the analysts at PwC foresee AI adding close to $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- Wall Street's billionaire investors have mixed views about the companies embracing this technology.\n\nBased on the latest round of 13Fs, which covers trading activity during the March-ended quarter, a number of prominent billionaires were active sellers of AI kingpin Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). At the same time, these very same billionaire money managers were buying shares of four other promising artificial intelligence stocks.\n\nTop-notch billionaire money managers dumped shares of Nvidia\n\nSince the start of 2023, shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed by 802%, as of the closing bell on June 14, which translates into nearly $2.9 trillion in added market value. This helps to explain why it was a no-brainer for the company's board to approve a 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed on June 7.\n\nNvidia's outperformance has everything to do with its graphics processing units (GPUs) dominating in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, Nvidia was responsible for 3.76 million of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped last year.\n\nFurthermore, demand for Nvidia's AI-accelerated chips has completely overwhelmed supply. This has sent the selling price of Nvidia's GPUs skyward and meaningfully increased its adjusted gross margin.\n\nBut in spite of Nvidia's first-mover advantages, two prominent billionaires dumped more than 2 million shares of the company during the first quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nWhile simple profit-taking might explain some of this selling activity, there may be other catalysts behind Laffont's and Griffin's decision to decisively reduce their respective stakes in Nvidia.\n\nAs I've pointed out numerous times before, history has not been kind to next-big-thing innovations over the last 30 years. Not one game-changing innovation has avoided a bubble-bursting event. Investors commonly overestimate how quickly a new technology or innovation will become mainstream, and they're likely doing it again with artificial intelligence. Since no company has benefited more directly from AI, Nvidia would probably be the hardest hit if the AI bubble bursts.\n\nIt's also going to be increasingly difficult for Nvidia to sustain its growth trajectory and adjusted gross margin with competition coming at it from all angles. Since it can't meet all of its orders, external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel can be market share winners by default.\n\nTo add to this point, Nvidia's top customers are all working on AI-GPUs of their own. Even if these chips are simply to complement Nvidia's prized H100 GPU, it signals a purposeful lessening of reliance on the company's data center GPU architecture over time.\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont piled into AI networking and cloud companies\n\nBut while Philippe Laffont was reducing Coatue's stake in Nvidia by 68% during the first quarter, he and his team were simultaneously gobbling up shares of AI networking solutions company Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), as well as cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). Coatue purchased 416,460 shares of Broadcom and 2,556,774 shares of Salesforce.\n\nBroadcom, which announced a 10-for-1 forward-stock split of its own last week, is a rising star in AI-accelerated networking solutions. The company's Jericho 3 chip has the ability to connect up to 32,000 GPUs, which can optimize processing speeds and reduce tail latency. In plainer English, Broadcom's AI solutions are expediting the processing needs of enterprise data centers responsible for training large language models (LLMs) and running generative AI solutions.\n\nBut Broadcom has plenty of momentum outside of the AI arena, too. It's still a dominant player in next-generation wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones, and also provides an assortment of connectivity solutions and sensors for industrial equipment and new vehicles. The company's backlog and cash-flow consistency are tough to top in the tech sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Salesforce is harnessing the power of AI to personalize its marketing efforts, automate certain repetitive tasks (e.g., data entry), and help it target new customers to boost its own sales. CRM software is, after all, designed to enhance existing customer relationships and grow sales. Predicting which existing clients might purchase a new product or service can be improved with AI.\n\nThere's little doubt Salesforce's long-term success has to do with its dominance in the CRM space. A recent report from IDC found that Salesforce accounted for a whopping 21.7% of global cloud-based CRM spending in 2023. With over three times the market share of its next-closest competitor (Microsoft at 5.9%), it should have no trouble retaining this competitive edge for many years to come.\n\nBillionaire Ken Griffin chose something a little more \"Magnificent\"\n\nSince its inception in 1990, Ken Griffin's hedge fund has generated $74 billion in total gains. No other hedge fund has come close to matching this mark. That's what makes Citadel selling roughly 2.46 million shares of Nvidia all the more interesting -- as well as Griffin and his teams' decision to buy two AI-inspired \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nDuring the March-ended quarter, Citadel Advisors added 352,453 shares of e-commerce titan Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), as well as 747,887 shares of tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nIn addition to designing its own AI chips, Amazon is aggressively deploying generative AI solutions across its various operating segments. For instance, it's made generative AI solutions available to its Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers, who are able to use the technology to do everything from customize AI virtual assistants to train LLMs. AWS is one of Amazon's fastest-growing segments, and is often responsible for the lion's share of its operating income.\n\nDon't overlook subscription services or advertising, either. Amazon attracts in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion visitors to its site each month, which yields quite a bit of ad revenue. Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has more than likely added to this total since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football.\n\nAs for Apple, it made waves during its 2024 developer conference when it introduced \"Apple Intelligence\" -- the company's collective term for a series of AI-inspired upgrades to its various products and services. This includes everything from emoji generation based on entered text to the integration of OpenAI's virtual chatbot ChatGPT-4o later this year.\n\nMore so than any of the companies mentioned here, Apple brings cash-flow predictability to the table. It has an extremely loyal customer base, a well-known brand, and has often led with innovation. Apple has also repurchased $674 billion worth of its common stock since 2013 began, which is more than any other public company. These buybacks have undoubtedly helped to increase its earnings per share and made the company more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Specifically, on a year-to-date basis, Nvidia is up 181.46%.\n\nIn this line, Finbold explored how much the equity would return for investors who made specific investments. For instance, if one had the foresight to invest $1,000 in Nvidia stock at the start of 2024, given the 181.46% increase in the stock price, the investment would now be worth $2,814.60, reflecting a profit of $1,814.60.\n\nThe remarkable growth of Nvidia's market value over the past year has highlighted the Wall Street craze fueled by the promise of AI technology. Notably, Nvidia's rally has boosted its valuation and significantly contributed to the record highs seen in the S&P 500.\n\nIn addition to the AI bet, Nvidia's growth and increased interest can be attributed to the decision to enact a 10-for-1 stock split on May 22. Since then, the share price has surged over 40%, significantly outpacing the S&P 500. This split has made Nvidia's stock more accessible to a broader range of investors, further fueling its growth.\n\nAt press time, Nvidia stock was trading at $135.58, having rallied over 3.5% in the last 24 hours.\n\nInterestingly, the stock seeks to sustain its momentum. In the pre-market, the equity was up 3.3%, hitting the $140 mark.\n\nNVDA is projected to open above $140 ahead of the market opening on June 20, indicating a pre-stock split valuation of $1,400 for the equity.\n\nThe most ideal bullish price target for Nvidia among analysts is the $200 mark. If the stock reaches this valuation, its market capitalization would be a staggering $4.9 trillion.\n\nHowever, despite the rally, there are concerns that the current hype around AI could diminish if there are signs of reduced spending on AI technologies. These concerns have been exacerbated for Nvidia as technical indicators have flashed warning signs.\n\nAccording to a Finbold report, the stock's Relative Strength Index (RSI) has consistently read above the critical 70 mark for consecutive sessions, indicating overbought conditions and signaling a potential crash.", "source": {"uri": "finbold.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finbold"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_l@finbold.com", "name": "Paul L.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relative strength index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2024/06/If-you-invested-1000-at-the-start-of-2024-in-Nvidia-stock-youd-now-have-this-much.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 966, "textEnd": 972}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 1464, "textEnd": 1471}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Here Are 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks I'd Buy Instead. | The Motley Fool", "body": "A generational run has made Nvidia one of the world's most valuable companies, but that comes with risks for new investors.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has taken the tech world by storm over the past 18 months or so. Brought to the mainstream by the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI tools, it has become an unavoidable topic in tech and business.\n\nThe biggest beneficiary of this newfound AI hype is Nvidia (NVDA 1.27%). Its stock has been on one of the best runs you'll ever see from a company of its size. It is up nearly 620% in the past two years and over 160% this year, making it the world's third-most-valuable company, with a market capitalization of over $3.2 trillion as of June 17.\n\nNvidia's impressive rally has been great news for its investors, but with its lofty valuation surpassing even the most optimistic fundamentals, the stock could be due for a correction. Don't worry, though. There are plenty of companies dealing with AI that make for great investments.\n\nHere are three to consider now:\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -0.05%), or TSMC for short, is the world's largest semiconductor foundry and a company that I'd argue flies under the radar regarding its importance to the tech world.\n\nWhile Nvidia has received much attention, it can't be overstated how vital TSMC is to its business. People have been flocking to Nvidia because of its high-performance GPUs, which are needed to train and power AI applications. However, TSMC manufactures the advanced chips Nvidia uses for its GPUs.\n\nCould Nvidia and others purchase chips from another manufacturer? Sure. Will those chips be as advanced and efficient as TSMC's? Not likely. Its chips are essentially the foundation of the AI ecosystem. Take them away, and every part of the AI pipeline becomes less effective.\n\nThe company's CEO said it expects revenue from some of its AI processors to more than double this year and account for a low-teens percentage of its total revenue. That's great news after it saw its revenue and operating income decline last year due to a weak smartphone and PC market.\n\nIts true profit maker is its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Although it only generated close to 16% of the company's revenue in the first quarter, it accounted for over 61% of its operating income. AWS also stands to gain the most from AI advancements.\n\nIt's the leading cloud platform, with a 31% market share, topping second-place Azure from Microsoft (MSFT -0.83%) at 25%. While Amazon has been enhancing AWS with AI features, how it uses the platform to enable businesses to develop and scale their own AI applications could be a huge growth driver for the foreseeable future.\n\nAmazon SageMaker, for example, allows businesses to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for virtually any purpose. Amazon Bedrock allows businesses to build and scale generative AI applications that transform their operations and customer experiences.\n\nMicrosoft, maybe more so than any other tech company, has done a great job diversifying its business and building a comprehensive suite of products and services. That's largely why it has had so much sustained success over decades and now sits as the world's most valuable public company.\n\nThe tech powerhouse has its hand in many aspects of the business world. Companies rely on it for productivity tools (including Excel, Word, and Teams), enterprise software (Dynamics365), cloud services (Azure), recruiting (LinkedIn), operating systems (Windows), and other vital business applications.\n\nAfter signing a partnership with OpenAI that gives Microsoft exclusive licenses to OpenAI's large language models (LLMs), the company has the chance to bolster its suite of products and maintain its stronghold in the enterprise technology world.\n\nMicrosoft's stock seems like a no-brainer for long-term investors, even with its relatively expensive valuation.

Firstly, while Nvidia excels with its graphics chips powering generative AI, questions linger on whether its clients like Microsoft and Alphabet (Google) have clear plans to monetize this technology. Secondly, Nvidia has surpassed Intel in earnings and valuation, prompting speculation about the sustainability of its computing dominance and drawing comparisons to Cisco's rise during the dotcom era.Nvidia's extraordinary run to the top of the market capitalisation sweepstakes this week begs answers to three questions. One, given that Santa Clara-headquartered tech MNC is racing ahead on the strength of its graphic chips that fuel generative AI, do its clients, such as Microsoft and Alphabet (Google), have concrete monetisation plans for the technology? Two, Nvidia has left its much-bigger rival Intel far behind in both earnings and valuations. So, is it right now open to challenges to its temporary computing monopoly? The analogy to Cisco's rise during the dotcom boom is stark. For those of us who remember, the internet delivered, but not the company making the switches connecting it. Three, for Nvidia to deliver on its forward earnings, will the hardware manufacturer be able to compete with its software-producing clients, which use its chips, and not run into antitrust scrutiny?\n\nThe position of the world's most fancied company has had a chequered history, with some companies holding on to it for years, while others have held momentarily. Exxon and Microsoft offer cautionary tales of energy and dotcom bubbles being pricked, something Nvidia CEO is well aware of. The company has doubled its valuation since the beginning of this year, added $1 tn in 100 days, and eight years ago, its value was 1% of its current $3.34 tn. This would be among the most spectacular movements in the price of any large technology stock, making Microsoft and Apple, which it has toppled, appear sedate. Both these companies have some reservations about what makes Nvidia tick among investors. Other disruptors like Elon Musk are bemused by the market frenzy over AI stocks.\n\nFor the moment, Nvidia is improving upon its forward price-earnings, suggesting there may be some upside to the stock. Yet, its investors could have priced themselves out of entry points unless the company weaves some extraordinary magic. Those rabbits should emerge from the hats of Nvidia's clients, which may prop up the stock, but with no guarantee of leading the pack.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monopoly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_corporation", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multinational corporation"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111120161,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-62676,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Its market value has already doubled this year, after tripling last year. It has added $1 trillion in market capitalization -- more than Warren Buffett's storied Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B), in the 23 trading days since May 20, according to a Deutsche Bank note distributed Thursday morning.\n\nAnd with a market capitalization of more than $3.4 trillion, Nvidia has in recent weeks become larger than the respective stock markets of Germany, France, and the U.K. The only countries with national stock markets worth more than Nvidia as of Thursday were India, Japan, China, and, of course, the U.S.\n\nGiven how quickly the stock has climbed, it's reasonable to expect some profit-taking in the near term, Bank of America Securities analysts said in a note Thursday. Volatility could be short-lived, they wrote, however, because of the company's solid fundamentals and relatively attractive valuation.\n\nWe're still in the early phases of the AI hardware deployment, the analysts said, and Nvidia should benefit from solid demand as it rolls out its next-gen Blackwell system later this year. Plus, Nvidia currently trades at about 30x price-to-earnings in Bank of America's bull case -- not that much higher than the entire S&P 500's P/E ratio of 23.6 and in line with the Nasdaq 100's ratio of 31.7.\n\nShares of Nvidia were up 1.5% at $137.58 in late-morning trading Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq-100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq-100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/mgJd7naEvV3eJpG7AtYV4WXxV3s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-21551277141-78eeb2850fc74cc88257a6e04b9cefc5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-20", "textStart": 490, "textEnd": 496}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

But they remain the best ways to bet on the AI megatrend.\n\nSince the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the technology world by storm. Few companies have benefited more than hardware giants like Nvidia (NVDA 3.51%) and Broadcom (AVGO -1.44%), which supply the data center equipment needed to support this fast-growing industry.\n\nBusiness is booming, and both companies have turned to stock splits to keep their shares liquid and available to smaller investors. Let's explore the long-term prospects of both companies while acknowledging the potential challenges they may face in the near term.\n\nAfter seeing its shares rise over 3,500% in just five years, it's no surprise that Nvidia relies on frequent stock splits to keep its share price under control. The most recent was a 10-for-1 split, effective as of June 7, that brought its stock to around $120 per share. And with the artificial intelligence industry in its early innings, Nvidia is still a long-term winner.\n\nThere is no shortage of grandiose projections for the future of AI. Bloomberg Intelligence believes the industry could be worth a whopping $1.3 trillion by 2032. And with an 80% market share in the advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to power the large language models, Nvidia undeniably has a bright future from a demand perspective.\n\nWith a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 51, Nvidia's shares are also fairly valued relative to growth. First-quarter revenue increased 262% year over year to $26 billion while net income surged 628% to $14.9 billion.\n\nThat said, every new industry experiences growing pains. And with 87% of Nvidia's sales coming from data center hardware, the company is exceptionally vulnerable to any near-term slowdown in AI chip demand, even if its long-term future remains bright.\n\nWith an unusually high stock price of $1,735 per share, Broadcom seemed overdue for a split when it announced a 10-for-1 swap expected to go live on July 15. Like Nvidia, the company's stock has soared amid rising AI hardware demand. However, its lower valuation and more diversified revenue streams could make it a safer way to bet on this opportunity.\n\nWhile Nvidia is known for its general-purpose AI chips, Broadcom specializes in custom chips designed for its client's specific workloads. This niche allows its hardware to be more cost- and energy-efficient than mass-market alternatives. And business is booming.\n\nSecond-quarter revenue jumped 43% year over year to $12.5 billion, helped by rising AI-related demand and the recent acquisition of VMware, a cloud computing company focused on virtual machines, which can run apps on software instead of physical computers. VMware helps diversify Broadcom into many different sides of the tech industry, shielding it from a potential slowdown in demand for AI chips.\n\nWith a P/E multiple of 37, Broadcom is also reasonably priced compared to Nvidia, which trades for 51 times forward earnings, even though the latter company seems to have better growth prospects.\n\nWhile stock splits can create the illusion of affordability, they often can indicate the opposite. A stock split usually occurs after a company has already experienced extreme price appreciation. So, new investors aren't exactly getting a bargain deal. That said, over the long term, Nvidia and Broadcom still have what it takes to outperform the market.\n\nIn the near term, investors should consider the potential for volatility as the AI industry experiences its growing pains, just like the internet and other megatrends did historically. But between the two companies, Broadcom looks like the safer bet because of its lower valuation and greater diversification.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_ebiefung@fool.com", "name": "Will Ebiefung", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcom_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Broadcom Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "VMware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/780778/gettyimages-1433587895.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 919, "textEnd": 925}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 2061, "textEnd": 2068}], "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Here's What History Says Happens Next.", "body": "Now that its stock is the world's most valuable (based on market cap), many investors likely are wondering if they should sell or continue holding. Some who are on the sidelines might even wonder if it's too late to buy. Perhaps history can be a guide to making these decisions.\n\nOn Sept. 15, 1998, Microsoft passed General Electric to become the most valuable stock for the first time. According to data from the nonprofit American Business History Center, General Electric had been the top company without interruption for several years.\n\nFor its part, Microsoft sat by itself at the top of the leaderboard for a couple of years. Moreover, the stock more than doubled less than two years after it initially passed General Electric.\n\nThis is the first lesson from history: Once a company reaches the top, it tends to stay at the top for multiple years. That was the case for General Electric and Microsoft.\n\nAnd it was also the case for ExxonMobil and Apple. Therefore, if it follows the historical pattern, Nvidia stock will also likely enjoy a prolonged period at the top.\n\nOnce a company initially becomes the most valuable, history shows the stock price usually hasn't peaked yet. For example, ExxonMobil topped General Electric in February 2005. From there, the oil company's stock would rise another 60% over the next couple of years and 75% over the following decade.\n\nXOM data by YCharts.\n\nApple passed ExxonMobil in August 2011. In the five years leading up to taking the top spot, the stock was up around 500%, which is spectacular. Many investors likely thought they had missed the boat. But the stock didn't stop there: It doubled again over the subsequent five years.\n\nTherefore, if history is any guide, Nvidia stock could enjoy multiple years at the top and continue increasing in value.\n\nHistory has one more thing to show investors\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing from history is that the previous most valuable stocks outperformed the S&P 500 for the next five years after they reached the top.\n\nReturn data according to YCharts. Chart by author. *Alpha refers to a stock's performance relative to a benchmark (in this case, the S&P 500) and is designated in terms of percentage-point difference.\n\nIt's important to zoom out and consider why this is true. It's because a company doesn't just become the world's most valuable for no reason. Something good must be happening with the business. And whatever trends are in the company's favor tend to last for multiple years, at least.\n\nFor Microsoft, it rode the PC revolution to take the top spot. ExxonMobil benefited from an extreme and prolonged spike in oil prices. And Apple was at the front of the smartphone trend. These were material drivers of each business that played out over years, not days.\n\nNvidia is benefiting from the surging adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Even if there's a lot of over-the-top hype with this trend, important things are happening in AI, and many businesses are likely to continue experimenting with the technology's application in the coming years. This means that business could stay good for Nvidia, leading to more market-beating gains.\n\nAs an investor who places a strong emphasis on value, the valuation of Nvidia stock personally makes me quite nervous. The market cap is over $3 trillion, and it trades at an extreme price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 42. In the history of the stock market, there has never been a company this big that sported a valuation this high. For perspective, Nvidia's valuation is currently triple the valuation of Microsoft in the second-place spot.\n\nMy discomfort with the valuation aside, I can't deny that history says Nvidia stock hasn't peaked yet. It could stay at the top for multiple years. And it could outperform the S&P 500 from here as the AI trend continues to play out.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Revenue was up 19 percent, net income increased 26 percent - everything looked positive, but not extraordinarily so. It was the company's second quarter outlook predicting a 65 percent jump in revenue as well as the words of CEO Jensen Huang that sparked one of the most remarkable stock market rallies in recent memory.\n\n\"The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions -- accelerated computing and generative AI,\" Huang said at the time. \"A trillion dollars of installed global data center infrastructure will transition from general purpose to accelerated computing as companies race to apply generative AI into every product, service and business process.\" What investors heard was that Nvidia was at the forefront of a trillion-dollar opportunity, which immediately sent the company's share price to unprecedented highs. The next day, Nvidia added nearly $200 billion to its market capitalization and that was only the beginning.\n\nIn June 2023, the company reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion for the first time, on March 1, 2024 it closed above $2 trillion and a little more than three months later, it surpassed $3 trillion. Earlier this week, Nvidia passed the ultimate milestone, when its market cap, boosted by a recent stock split, surged past Microsoft and Apple to make the chipmaker the most valuable company in the world. While investors will certainly have enjoyed the ride up to this point, questions over whether Nvidia's current valuation is justified and sustainable are naturally getting louder.

On Tuesday, Nvidia surpassed $3.3 trillion in market capitalization, moving it ahead of Microsoft as the biggest stock in the U.S. But its market cap had already raced ahead of the cumulative value for entire stock markets in Germany, France and the United Kingdom, measured individually and in U.S. dollars. This was pointed out by Deutsche Bank in its \"chart of the day.\" Only India, Japan, China and the U.S. have stock markets bigger than Nvidia alone, according to Deutsche Bank. Nvidia has become the main way for investors to bet on the rise of artificial intelligence. The large language models that have rolled out over the past year, including OpenAI, rely on high end semiconductors to operate efficiently. Nvidia is considered to be well ahead of its peers in this chip race. And while semiconductors have traditionally been a cyclical business, the potential for a long period of AI investment across the business world has Wall Street analysts projecting continued growth for Nvidia for many years. The excitement shows no signs of abating. Nvidia added a trillion dollars in market cap in just 23 trading days since May 20 -- the fastest on record, according to Deutsche Bank. For context, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is only at roughly $900 billion total after 135 years. The rally has also fueled concerns about the concentration of the U.S. stock market in just a few technology names.

Nvidia trades today at 79 times its trailing 12-month revenues and 42 times its trailing 12-month profits, fetching a price-to-sales ratio about 15 times richer than the median S&P component and a price-to-earnings ratio of about three times higher than the typical S&P stock. Basically, Nvidia's valuation relies upon the AI golden child rapidly expanding earnings in coming quarters, which is in line with most analysts' expectations, but still requires investors to take a leap of faith.\n\nCornering roughly 80% of the AI semiconductor chip market, Nvidia designs the graphics processing units which are today's \"new gold or oil in the tech sector,\" according to Wedbush analysts. After going public in 1999 at a split-adjusted share price of $.04, Nvidia spent much of its existence as a video game-first company before spearheading the 2020s AI boom.

However, Nvidia's meteoric rise has recently fueled skepticism from bears, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble of 1995 to 2000.\n\nSpeaking to this point, Morningstar strategist Brian Colello believes Nvidia's stock is fairly valued at $105 per share after its 10-for-1 stock split went into effect on June 10. Nonetheless, the GPU-titan's shares have already jumped to $136 a little over a week post-split, putting it in overvalued territory, according to Colello.\n\nIs Nvidia's stock really overvalued? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Nvidia's stock appears to be in bubble territory. The company's shares trade at 52 times forward earnings, significantly higher than the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.55 and price-to-sales ratio of over 42 are well above the averages for technology stocks and the semiconductor industry, respectively. These traditional valuation metrics paint a picture of an extremely overvalued stock.\n\nHowever, a fundamental analysis may not be the most appropriate approach in this case. Generative AI holds the potential to fundamentally reshape the global economy. AI is poised to radically enhance worker productivity and create entirely new markets, possibly unlocking trillions of dollars in value across all sectors of the global economy.\n\nThe economic potential of AI is astounding. McKinsey & Co. estimates that generative AI could unlock up to $17.7 trillion in economic value, while Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang believes the global AI economy is on pace to eventually top $100 trillion.\n\nTo put this into perspective, Nvidia's current market cap stands at $3.35 trillion, which may seem astronomical at first glance but is a drop in the bucket when compared to where the global economy is headed in the age of AI.\n\nSome analysts have argued that rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel may enjoy a windfall from AI-centric companies diversifying their hardware-sourcing requirements in the years ahead, but the reality is far more complex. Nvidia's GPUs and complementary CUDA platform are simply too far ahead of the competition, especially with a full-on arms race occurring in AI.\n\nCore AI developers don't have the luxury of switching to a competing platform at this critical juncture, despite the risks associated with overreliance on a single chip designer. In other words, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel might be able to carve out a rather profitable niche in AI-capable chips but aren't going to significantly erode Nvidia's market share among the most important developers driving the bus, so to speak.\n\nWhile Nvidia's stock may appear expensive and overvalued based on traditional metrics, it's essential to consider the company's central position in the AI revolution. With automation and an abundance of intelligence on track to redraw the global economy within a few short years, Nvidia's bull run is likely just getting started.\n\nAs such, the fearmongering over another dot-com-type bubble seems wholly unwarranted. It also grossly underestimates the transformative potential of this technology that many think will be the most important invention in the history of humanity.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.25%) has returned 15% and its market capitalization has increased from $40 trillion to $46 trillion. Put differently, Nvidia is responsible for more than one-third of the gains in the S&P 500 this year.\n\nAs a result, the average S&P 500 stock trails the index by 10.7%, the worst underperformance since 1990, according to The Wall Street Journal. That means investors without exposure to Nvidia have found it exceptionally difficult to beat the market this year.\n\nInvestors can learn a few important lessons from the situation, and they can take steps to avoid a similar problem in the future. Read on to learn more.\n\nNvidia stock has gotten cheaper over the last five quarters\n\nSome investors may have sold or avoided Nvidia due to concerns about valuation. Shares have surged 608% since the chipmaker reported financial results for Q4 of fiscal 2023 (ended January 29, 2023), and that much price appreciation compressed into such a short period usually means the price-to-earnings ratio has expanded. But that is not the case with Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's earnings per share increased 882% between Q4 of fiscal 2023 and Q1 of fiscal 2025 (ended April 30, 2024), outpacing the share price appreciation. As a result, Nvidia stock actually trades at a cheaper price-to-earnings multiple today than it did when the company reported financial results five quarters ago.\n\nAdditionally, while the current valuation of 79.3 times earnings looks expensive, valuation must be considered alongside growth. Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33% annually to $4.95 per diluted share by fiscal 2028 (ends January 30, 2028). If that number is divided into its current price-to-earnings multiple, the result is a PEG ratio of 2.4.\n\nThat is not necessarily cheap, per se, but it is cheaper than some mega-cap stocks. For instance, using the same methodology, Apple has a PEG ratio of 3.1 and Microsoft has a PEG ratio of 2.8.\n\nThe S&P 500 may be richly valued, but artificial intelligence has not created a stock market bubble\n\nAnother argument against Nvidia (and the broader stock market) is that artificial intelligence (AI) is overhyped, and that irrational euphoria surrounding the technology has created a stock market bubble. Some pessimists even compare the current market environment to the dot-com crash. But that comparison is inaccurate.\n\nIn January 2000, the five largest technology companies traded at an average valuation of 59 times forward earnings. Today, the five largest technology companies trade at an average valuation 37 times forward earnings. Additionally, the five largest technology companies today are expected to grow earnings 42% this year, while the five largest technology companies in 2000 were expected to grow earnings 30% in that year, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nTo be fair, the S&P 500 does trade at 21 times forward earnings, a premium to the five-year average of 19.2 times forward earnings, and enthusiasm about AI has undoubtedly played a role. But that does not mean AI is an overhyped technology destined to disappoint. It simply means the market is going through the normal phases of the Gartner Hype Cycle: Stocks first move too high, then move too low, before finally settling into a gradual upward slope.\n\nThe internet is an example of a technology that has been through the cycle. Naysayers labeled the internet a fad, and some experts expected it to fail. Economist Paul Krugman predicted it would have no more economic impact than the fax machine. Those opinions are laughable in hindsight. The digital economy accounted for 10% of U.S. GDP in 2022, or $2.6 trillion, and it was growing three times faster than the overall economy.\n\nI believe AI will be much the same two decades from now. The naysayers will seem woefully out of touch in hindsight, and patient investors that bought good stocks (at reasonable prices) will have been well rewarded. That does not necessarily mean Nvidia is worth buying, but I think Morgan Stanley analysts have the right idea. \"Bottom line, we think the backdrop warrants AI exposure even amid extreme enthusiasm -- and Nvidia remains the clearest way to get that exposure.\"\n\nFor context, Morgan Stanley has set Nvidia with a split-adjusted price target of $116 per share. The analysts have also outlined a bear-case target of $51 per share and a bull-case target of $136 per share.\n\nHow investors can avoid the Nvidia problem in the future\n\nInvestors that never owned (or sold out of) Nvidia prior to 2024 have had a difficult time beating the market. As mentioned, the average S&P 500 stock has underperformed the index by 10.7% year to date, the largest underperformance since 1990.\n\nOne way investors can avoid a similar problem in the future is by owning an S&P 500 index fund. That strategy will not help investors beat the market, but it will help them match its returns. Personally, I keep a relatively large portion of my portfolio in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, and I keep the remainder in individual stocks. In doing so, my portfolio will beat the market if my stocks outperform, but it won't lag the market too much if my stocks underperform.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trevor_jennewine@fool.com", "name": "Trevor Jennewine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEG_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PEG ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock market bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vanguard_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Vanguard Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Krugman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Net income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F781135%2Fgrowth-27.jpg&op=resize&w=400&h=400", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2000-01-", "textStart": 2606, "textEnd": 2618}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "8186689248", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-06-20", "time": "09:16:06", "dateTime": "2024-06-20T09:16:06Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-06-20T09:10:04Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.5529412031173706, "url": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-prominent-billionaires-selling-090600908.html", "title": "Forget Nvidia: Prominent Billionaires Are Selling It and Piling Into These 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead", "body": "With all eyes on the Federal Reserve and earnings season, it's possible investors missed what was, arguably, the most-important data release of the quarter five weeks ago.\n\nOn May 15, institutions with at least $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a snapshot to investors of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors have been buying and selling. It's effectively a blueprint that allows investors to see what stocks, industries, and trends have been piquing the interest of top-tier money managers.\n\nAs should be no surprise, first-quarter 13Fs showed a lot of trading activity in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\n\nCompanies involved in AI are using software and systems to handle tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. What gives AI such broad-reaching utility is the ability for software and AI-driven systems to learn without human intervention. This evolution of AI systems should improve efficiency and allow for new tasks to be learned.\n\nDespite the big-dollar potential associated with AI -- the analysts at PwC foresee AI adding close to $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- Wall Street's billionaire investors have mixed views about the companies embracing this technology.\n\nBased on the latest round of 13Fs, which covers trading activity during the March-ended quarter, a number of prominent billionaires were active sellers of AI kingpin Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). At the same time, these very same billionaire money managers were buying shares of four other promising artificial intelligence stocks.\n\nSince the start of 2023, shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed by 802%, as of the closing bell on June 14, which translates into nearly $2.9 trillion in added market value. This helps to explain why it was a no-brainer for the company's board to approve a 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed on June 7.\n\nNvidia's outperformance has everything to do with its graphics processing units (GPUs) dominating in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, Nvidia was responsible for 3.76 million of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped last year.\n\nFurthermore, demand for Nvidia's AI-accelerated chips has completely overwhelmed supply. This has sent the selling price of Nvidia's GPUs skyward and meaningfully increased its adjusted gross margin.\n\nBut in spite of Nvidia's first-mover advantages, two prominent billionaires dumped more than 2 million shares of the company during the first quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nWhile simple profit-taking might explain some of this selling activity, there may be other catalysts behind Laffont's and Griffin's decision to decisively reduce their respective stakes in Nvidia.\n\nAs I've pointed out numerous times before, history has not been kind to next-big-thing innovations over the last 30 years. Not one game-changing innovation has avoided a bubble-bursting event. Investors commonly overestimate how quickly a new technology or innovation will become mainstream, and they're likely doing it again with artificial intelligence. Since no company has benefited more directly from AI, Nvidia would probably be the hardest hit if the AI bubble bursts.\n\nIt's also going to be increasingly difficult for Nvidia to sustain its growth trajectory and adjusted gross margin with competition coming at it from all angles. Since it can't meet all of its orders, external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel can be market share winners by default.\n\nTo add to this point, Nvidia's top customers are all working on AI-GPUs of their own. Even if these chips are simply to complement Nvidia's prized H100 GPU, it signals a purposeful lessening of reliance on the company's data center GPU architecture over time.\n\nBut while Philippe Laffont was reducing Coatue's stake in Nvidia by 68% during the first quarter, he and his team were simultaneously gobbling up shares of AI networking solutions company Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO), as well as cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). Coatue purchased 416,460 shares of Broadcom and 2,556,774 shares of Salesforce.\n\nBroadcom, which announced a 10-for-1 forward-stock split of its own last week, is a rising star in AI-accelerated networking solutions. The company's Jericho 3 chip has the ability to connect up to 32,000 GPUs, which can optimize processing speeds and reduce tail latency. In plainer English, Broadcom's AI solutions are expediting the processing needs of enterprise data centers responsible for training large language models (LLMs) and running generative AI solutions.\n\nBut Broadcom has plenty of momentum outside of the AI arena, too. It's still a dominant player in next-generation wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones, and also provides an assortment of connectivity solutions and sensors for industrial equipment and new vehicles. The company's backlog and cash-flow consistency are tough to top in the tech sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Salesforce is harnessing the power of AI to personalize its marketing efforts, automate certain repetitive tasks (e.g., data entry), and help it target new customers to boost its own sales. CRM software is, after all, designed to enhance existing customer relationships and grow sales. Predicting which existing clients might purchase a new product or service can be improved with AI.\n\nThere's little doubt Salesforce's long-term success has to do with its dominance in the CRM space. A recent report from IDC found that Salesforce accounted for a whopping 21.7% of global cloud-based CRM spending in 2023. With over three times the market share of its next-closest competitor (Microsoft at 5.9%), it should have no trouble retaining this competitive edge for many years to come.\n\nSince its inception in 1990, Ken Griffin's hedge fund has generated $74 billion in total gains. No other hedge fund has come close to matching this mark. That's what makes Citadel selling roughly 2.46 million shares of Nvidia all the more interesting -- as well as Griffin and his teams' decision to buy two AI-inspired \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nDuring the March-ended quarter, Citadel Advisors added 352,453 shares of e-commerce titan Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), as well as 747,887 shares of tech stock Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nIn addition to designing its own AI chips, Amazon is aggressively deploying generative AI solutions across its various operating segments. For instance, it's made generative AI solutions available to its Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers, who are able to use the technology to do everything from customize AI virtual assistants to train LLMs. AWS is one of Amazon's fastest-growing segments, and is often responsible for the lion's share of its operating income.\n\nDon't overlook subscription services or advertising, either. Amazon attracts in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion visitors to its site each month, which yields quite a bit of ad revenue. Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has more than likely added to this total since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football.\n\nAs for Apple, it made waves during its 2024 developer conference when it introduced \"Apple Intelligence\" -- the company's collective term for a series of AI-inspired upgrades to its various products and services. This includes everything from emoji generation based on entered text to the integration of OpenAI's virtual chatbot ChatGPT-4o later this year.\n\nMore so than any of the companies mentioned here, Apple brings cash-flow predictability to the table. It has an extremely loyal customer base, a well-known brand, and has often led with innovation. Apple has also repurchased $674 billion worth of its common stock since 2013 began, which is more than any other public company. These buybacks have undoubtedly helped to increase its earnings per share and made the company more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

That's a Big Problem for the Average S&P 500 Stock (and Some Investors).", "body": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has returned 174% in 2024, and its market capitalization has increased from $1.2 trillion to $3.3 trillion. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has returned 15% and its market capitalization has increased from $40 trillion to $46 trillion. Put differently, Nvidia is responsible for more than one-third of the gains in the S&P 500 this year.\n\nAs a result, the average S&P 500 stock trails the index by 10.7%, the worst underperformance since 1990, according to The Wall Street Journal. That means investors without exposure to Nvidia have found it exceptionally difficult to beat the market this year.\n\nInvestors can learn a few important lessons from the situation, and they can take steps to avoid a similar problem in the future. Read on to learn more.\n\nNvidia stock has gotten cheaper over the last five quarters\n\nSome investors may have sold or avoided Nvidia due to concerns about valuation. Shares have surged 608% since the chipmaker reported financial results for Q4 of fiscal 2023 (ended January 29, 2023), and that much price appreciation compressed into such a short period usually means the price-to-earnings ratio has expanded. But that is not the case with Nvidia.\n\nNvidia's earnings per share increased 882% between Q4 of fiscal 2023 and Q1 of fiscal 2025 (ended April 30, 2024), outpacing the share price appreciation. As a result, Nvidia stock actually trades at a cheaper price-to-earnings multiple today than it did when the company reported financial results five quarters ago.\n\nAdditionally, while the current valuation of 79.3 times earnings looks expensive, valuation must be considered alongside growth. Wall Street expects Nvidia to grow earnings per share at 33% annually to $4.95 per diluted share by fiscal 2028 (ends January 30, 2028). If that number is divided into its current price-to-earnings multiple, the result is a PEG ratio of 2.4.\n\nThat is not necessarily cheap, per se, but it is cheaper than some mega-cap stocks. For instance, using the same methodology, Apple has a PEG ratio of 3.1 and Microsoft has a PEG ratio of 2.8.\n\nThe S&P 500 may be richly valued, but artificial intelligence has not created a stock market bubble\n\nAnother argument against Nvidia (and the broader stock market) is that artificial intelligence (AI) is overhyped, and that irrational euphoria surrounding the technology has created a stock market bubble. Some pessimists even compare the current market environment to the dot-com crash. But that comparison is inaccurate.\n\nIn January 2000, the five largest technology companies traded at an average valuation of 59 times forward earnings. Today, the five largest technology companies trade at an average valuation 37 times forward earnings. Additionally, the five largest technology companies today are expected to grow earnings 42% this year, while the five largest technology companies in 2000 were expected to grow earnings 30% in that year, according to JPMorgan Chase.\n\nTo be fair, the S&P 500 does trade at 21 times forward earnings, a premium to the five-year average of 19.2 times forward earnings, and enthusiasm about AI has undoubtedly played a role. But that does not mean AI is an overhyped technology destined to disappoint. It simply means the market is going through the normal phases of the Gartner Hype Cycle: Stocks first move too high, then move too low, before finally settling into a gradual upward slope.\n\nThe internet is an example of a technology that has been through the cycle. Naysayers labeled the internet a fad, and some experts expected it to fail. Economist Paul Krugman predicted it would have no more economic impact than the fax machine. Those opinions are laughable in hindsight. The digital economy accounted for 10% of U.S. GDP in 2022, or $2.6 trillion, and it was growing three times faster than the overall economy.\n\nI believe AI will be much the same two decades from now. The naysayers will seem woefully out of touch in hindsight, and patient investors that bought good stocks (at reasonable prices) will have been well rewarded. That does not necessarily mean Nvidia is worth buying, but I think Morgan Stanley analysts have the right idea. \"Bottom line, we think the backdrop warrants AI exposure even amid extreme enthusiasm -- and Nvidia remains the clearest way to get that exposure.\"\n\nFor context, Morgan Stanley has set Nvidia with a split-adjusted price target of $116 per share. The analysts have also outlined a bear-case target of $51 per share and a bull-case target of $136 per share.\n\nHow investors can avoid the Nvidia problem in the future\n\nInvestors that never owned (or sold out of) Nvidia prior to 2024 have had a difficult time beating the market. As mentioned, the average S&P 500 stock has underperformed the index by 10.7% year to date, the largest underperformance since 1990.\n\nOne way investors can avoid a similar problem in the future is by owning an S&P 500 index fund. That strategy will not help investors beat the market, but it will help them match its returns. Personally, I keep a relatively large portion of my portfolio in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, and I keep the remainder in individual stocks. In doing so, my portfolio will beat the market if my stocks outperform, but it won't lag the market too much if my stocks underperform.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $830,777!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than quadrupled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nJPMorgan Chase is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

The company's big competitive advantage is its proprietary software, which enables its AI chips to work together quite effectively. As a result, developers are able to easily build programs on Nvidia's chips, and developers have become accustomed to using its offerings. The company's software also enables AI applications to run quickly.\n\nIn a note to investors Tuesday, investment bank Rosenblatt predicted that Nvidia's shares could reach $200. That would put the company's market capitalization at $5 trillion.\n\nThe bank believes that, in the longer term, a significantly higher amount of Nvidia's sales will be generated from subscriptions to its software. As a result, its revenue will become more predictable, making its shares even more valuable, Rosenblatt contended.\n\nMoreover, the shares certainly do have a great deal of positive momentum at this point.\n\nOn the other hand, a number of Nvidia's competitors and largest customers are developing their own software that could eventually rival Nvidia's offering. Specifically, these companies, including Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), are trying to improve Triton, which was first introduced by OpenAI in 2021.

Nvidia, headed by the Taiwanese tycoon Jensen Huang, started out back in 1993 producing computer chips to make video games more realistic.\n\nBut it spotted early how tech-nology was changing and invested heavily in making its computer chips incredibly fast and powerful.\n\nThese processors are now in huge demand to help power data centres and run complex computing tasks required by AI firms.\n\nNvidia's share price really started rocketing as awareness of AI grew -- helped by OpenAI's ChatGPT, which it powers.\n\nA single chip costs between $25,000 and $40,000 and Facebook's Meta has said it will buy 350,000 this year alone.\n\nCrucially, Nvidia's strength has been due to it being so far ahead of the game that investors are betting few can catch up. One analyst quipped: \"There's a war going on in AI and Nvidia is the only arms dealer.\"\n\nNvidia's share price has risen by an incredible 591,078 per cent since it first started trading on the US stock market in 1999. If an investor had backed the firm with $10,000 (\u00a37,850) they'd have made almost $50million (\u00a339million).\n\nWhich makes the firm's name rather apt -- as it comes from \"Invidia\", Latin for envy.\n\nNVIDIA president Jensen Huang is now such a superstar in the tech world that he gets asked to sign women's chests.\n\nThat was the situation he found himself in, left, at a recent computer conference in Taipei.

A 13F provides a snapshot to investors of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors have been buying and selling. It's effectively a blueprint that allows investors to see what stocks, industries, and trends have been piquing the interest of top-tier money managers.\n\nAs should be no surprise, first-quarter 13Fs showed a lot of trading activity in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\n\nCompanies involved in AI are using software and systems to handle tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. What gives AI such broad-reaching utility is the ability for software and AI-driven systems to learn without human intervention. This evolution of AI systems should improve efficiency and allow for new tasks to be learned.\n\nDespite the big-dollar potential associated with AI -- the analysts at PwC foresee AI adding close to $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- Wall Street's billionaire investors have mixed views about the companies embracing this technology.\n\nBased on the latest round of 13Fs, which covers trading activity during the March-ended quarter, a number of prominent billionaires were active sellers of AI kingpin Nvidia (NVDA 3.51%). At the same time, these very same billionaire money managers were buying shares of four other promising artificial intelligence stocks.\n\nSince the start of 2023, shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed by 802%, as of the closing bell on June 14, which translates into nearly $2.9 trillion in added market value. This helps to explain why it was a no-brainer for the company's board to approve a 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed on June 7.\n\nNvidia's outperformance has everything to do with its graphics processing units (GPUs) dominating in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, Nvidia was responsible for 3.76 million of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped last year.\n\nFurthermore, demand for Nvidia's AI-accelerated chips has completely overwhelmed supply. This has sent the selling price of Nvidia's GPUs skyward and meaningfully increased its adjusted gross margin.\n\nBut in spite of Nvidia's first-mover advantages, two prominent billionaires dumped more than 2 million shares of the company during the first quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nWhile simple profit-taking might explain some of this selling activity, there may be other catalysts behind Laffont's and Griffin's decision to decisively reduce their respective stakes in Nvidia.\n\nAs I've pointed out numerous times before, history has not been kind to next-big-thing innovations over the last 30 years. Not one game-changing innovation has avoided a bubble-bursting event. Investors commonly overestimate how quickly a new technology or innovation will become mainstream, and they're likely doing it again with artificial intelligence. Since no company has benefited more directly from AI, Nvidia would probably be the hardest hit if the AI bubble bursts.\n\nIt's also going to be increasingly difficult for Nvidia to sustain its growth trajectory and adjusted gross margin with competition coming at it from all angles. Since it can't meet all of its orders, external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel can be market share winners by default.\n\nTo add to this point, Nvidia's top customers are all working on AI-GPUs of their own. Even if these chips are simply to complement Nvidia's prized H100 GPU, it signals a purposeful lessening of reliance on the company's data center GPU architecture over time.\n\nBut while Philippe Laffont was reducing Coatue's stake in Nvidia by 68% during the first quarter, he and his team were simultaneously gobbling up shares of AI networking solutions company Broadcom (AVGO -1.44%), as well as cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce (CRM 0.58%). Coatue purchased 416,460 shares of Broadcom and 2,556,774 shares of Salesforce.\n\nBroadcom, which announced a 10-for-1 forward-stock split of its own last week, is a rising star in AI-accelerated networking solutions. The company's Jericho 3 chip has the ability to connect up to 32,000 GPUs, which can optimize processing speeds and reduce tail latency. In plainer English, Broadcom's AI solutions are expediting the processing needs of enterprise data centers responsible for training large language models (LLMs) and running generative AI solutions.\n\nBut Broadcom has plenty of momentum outside of the AI arena, too. It's still a dominant player in next-generation wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones, and also provides an assortment of connectivity solutions and sensors for industrial equipment and new vehicles. The company's backlog and cash-flow consistency are tough to top in the tech sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Salesforce is harnessing the power of AI to personalize its marketing efforts, automate certain repetitive tasks (e.g., data entry), and help it target new customers to boost its own sales. CRM software is, after all, designed to enhance existing customer relationships and grow sales. Predicting which existing clients might purchase a new product or service can be improved with AI.\n\nThere's little doubt Salesforce's long-term success has to do with its dominance in the CRM space. A recent report from IDC found that Salesforce accounted for a whopping 21.7% of global cloud-based CRM spending in 2023. With over three times the market share of its next-closest competitor (Microsoft at 5.9%), it should have no trouble retaining this competitive edge for many years to come.\n\nSince its inception in 1990, Ken Griffin's hedge fund has generated $74 billion in total gains. No other hedge fund has come close to matching this mark. That's what makes Citadel selling roughly 2.46 million shares of Nvidia all the more interesting -- as well as Griffin and his teams' decision to buy two AI-inspired \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nDuring the March-ended quarter, Citadel Advisors added 352,453 shares of e-commerce titan Amazon (AMZN -0.68%), as well as 747,887 shares of tech stock Apple (AAPL -1.10%).\n\nIn addition to designing its own AI chips, Amazon is aggressively deploying generative AI solutions across its various operating segments. For instance, it's made generative AI solutions available to its Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers, who are able to use the technology to do everything from customize AI virtual assistants to train LLMs. AWS is one of Amazon's fastest-growing segments, and is often responsible for the lion's share of its operating income.\n\nDon't overlook subscription services or advertising, either. Amazon attracts in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion visitors to its site each month, which yields quite a bit of ad revenue. Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has more than likely added to this total since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football.\n\nAs for Apple, it made waves during its 2024 developer conference when it introduced \"Apple Intelligence\" -- the company's collective term for a series of AI-inspired upgrades to its various products and services. This includes everything from emoji generation based on entered text to the integration of OpenAI's virtual chatbot ChatGPT-4o later this year.\n\nMore so than any of the companies mentioned here, Apple brings cash-flow predictability to the table. It has an extremely loyal customer base, a well-known brand, and has often led with innovation. Apple has also repurchased $674 billion worth of its common stock since 2013 began, which is more than any other public company. These buybacks have undoubtedly helped to increase its earnings per share and made the company more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news",

Here's What History Says Happens Next.", "body": "Now that its stock is the world's most valuable (based on market cap), many investors likely are wondering if they should sell or continue holding. Some who are on the sidelines might even wonder if it's too late to buy. Perhaps history can be a guide to making these decisions.\n\nWhen it comes to the most valuable stock listed on a U.S. exchange, there have been four other companies that have worn the crown over the last 30 years: General Electric, which is now GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE), Microsoft, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). And investors might be pleasantly surprised by what happened to these stocks after reaching the top.\n\nOn Sept. 15, 1998, Microsoft passed General Electric to become the most valuable stock for the first time. According to data from the nonprofit American Business History Center, General Electric had been the top company without interruption for several years.\n\nFor its part, Microsoft sat by itself at the top of the leaderboard for a couple of years. Moreover, the stock more than doubled less than two years after it initially passed General Electric.\n\nThis is the first lesson from history: Once a company reaches the top, it tends to stay at the top for multiple years. That was the case for General Electric and Microsoft.\n\nAnd it was also the case for ExxonMobil and Apple. Therefore, if it follows the historical pattern, Nvidia stock will also likely enjoy a prolonged period at the top.\n\nOnce a company initially becomes the most valuable, history shows the stock price usually hasn't peaked yet. For example, ExxonMobil topped General Electric in February 2005. From there, the oil company's stock would rise another 60% over the next couple of years and 75% over the following decade.\n\nApple passed ExxonMobil in August 2011. In the five years leading up to taking the top spot, the stock was up around 500%, which is spectacular. Many investors likely thought they had missed the boat. But the stock didn't stop there: It doubled again over the subsequent five years.\n\nTherefore, if history is any guide, Nvidia stock could enjoy multiple years at the top and continue increasing in value.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing from history is that the previous most valuable stocks outperformed the S&P 500 for the next five years after they reached the top.\n\nReturn data according to YCharts. Chart by author. *Alpha refers to a stock's performance relative to a benchmark (in this case, the S&P 500) and is designated in terms of percentage-point difference.\n\nIt's important to zoom out and consider why this is true. It's because a company doesn't just become the world's most valuable for no reason. Something good must be happening with the business. And whatever trends are in the company's favor tend to last for multiple years, at least.\n\nFor Microsoft, it rode the PC revolution to take the top spot. ExxonMobil benefited from an extreme and prolonged spike in oil prices. And Apple was at the front of the smartphone trend. These were material drivers of each business that played out over years, not days.\n\nNvidia is benefiting from the surging adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Even if there's a lot of over-the-top hype with this trend, important things are happening in AI, and many businesses are likely to continue experimenting with the technology's application in the coming years. This means that business could stay good for Nvidia, leading to more market-beating gains.\n\nAs an investor who places a strong emphasis on value, the valuation of Nvidia stock personally makes me quite nervous. The market cap is over $3 trillion, and it trades at an extreme price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 42. In the history of the stock market, there has never been a company this big that sported a valuation this high. For perspective, Nvidia's valuation is currently triple the valuation of Microsoft in the second-place spot.\n\nMy discomfort with the valuation aside, I can't deny that history says Nvidia stock hasn't peaked yet. It could stay at the top for multiple years. And it could outperform the S&P 500 from here as the AI trend continues to play out.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Back then, there was an up-and-coming chip company called Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), with graphics processors that were popular in video game applications.\n\nThings weren't bad, as video games were a growth industry, though cyclical. But 2014 was a tough year. In fact, in the second quarter of that year, Nvidia posted a revenue decline.\n\nWith those types of results, investors might have viewed Nvidia as an already-mature company. But those looking more deeply might have learned of Nvidia's new software platform called CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture), which enabled Nvidia graphics chips to execute data processing in a parallel format. That meant many calculations could be executed simultaneously, whereas CPUs calculated data in a linear fashion.\n\nSome hypothesized that CUDA-enabled GPUs would one day overtake the mighty CPU as the main type of data center computing processor. Had one placed a modest $1,000 bet on that scenario, here's how much you would have made.\n\nA modest $1,000 investment in Nvidia in June of 2014 would have grown (dividends included) to a stunning $280,600 today! That's a 280-bagger, amounting to a 27,960% gain.\n\nTwo things happened. The capabilities of generative artificial intelligence technology became apparent following the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022 and Nvidia's GPUs became the best way to execute the massive number of calculations needed to train these models. As a result, enterprises began falling over themselves to buy these coveted chips.\n\nThat sent Nvidia's revenue up 262% last quarter to $26 billion, with net margin surging to 58.5%. For reference, in Q2 2014, Nvidia made just $977 million in revenue, with adjusted (non-GAAP) net margins of 13.6%.\n\nAs Nvidia shows, investing in just one incredible growth stock early on can make up for dozens of mediocre stock picks and make a huge difference to your financial security and independence. While not many stocks will turn into the next Nvidia, the \"next Nvidia\" could be out there waiting to be uncovered in the market today.\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

In a June 18 note to clients, the analysts announced an increase from $114 to $165, adjusted for Nvidia's recent stock split.\n\nThis revision reflects Stifel's new projection that Nvidia's stock will trade at about 40 times the anticipated fiscal 2027 earnings per share of $4.10.\n\nIvan Feinseth, an analyst at Tigress Financial, reaffirmed his \"buy\" rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $170. He emphasizes that Nvidia's ongoing advancements in GPU technology and product innovation are crucial to maintaining its leadership in the AI sector. Feinseth also notes that Nvidia's growing presence in data centers, driven by new product launches, will support its continued growth.\n\nAnalysts from Wells Fargo share the same optimism about Nvidia's prospects as their colleagues while lifting the NVDA stock price target from $125 to $155 in a research note published on June 18.\n\nIn what is currently the most bullish thesis on Nvidia stock, Rosenblatt Securities increased their price target for Nvidia from $140 to $200. The analysts credit Nvidia's Hopper, Blackwell, and Rubin series with driving significant market share gains in one of Silicon Valley's most successful product cycles.\n\nThey emphasize that while future gains in networking hardware like switches, network interface cards (NiCs), and data processing units (DPUs) are promising, the key driver is software that enhances hardware capabilities. This software is expected to grow significantly in the sales mix over the next decade, positively impacting Nvidia's valuation.\n\nThe analysts project Nvidia to achieve an EPS of $5.00 or more by 2026, supporting their raised price target based on a 40x P/E multiple.\n\nBuy stocks now with eToro - trusted and advanced investment platform", "source": {"uri": "finbold.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Finbold"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elmaz_sabovic@finbold.com", "name": "Elmaz Sabovic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Micro_Computer,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Micro Computer, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EToro", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EToro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Network interface controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_hardware", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Networking hardware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Games", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2024/06/Heres-when-Nvidia-stock-will-reach-200-according-to-analysts.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 1293, "textEnd": 1300, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

charts in the last roughly five years.\n\nThe market capitalization surge can be traced in part to the emergence of AI and machine-learning technologies, with Nvidia a core producer of the processors necessary for such products.\n\nBack in July 2019, a single Nvidia share fetched less than $4, meaning the stock price has risen by a factor of more than 30 since then.\n\nNvidia shares are also by

And for investors lucky enough to get in early, the gains are meteoric.\n\nAn investment of $1,000 in Nvidia in June 2014 would be worth over $297,600 at Wednesday's close, according to calculations from Morningstar Direct. That's cumulative growth of 29,660%.\n\nMuch of that came in the past year, as the chipmaker cemented itself as an artificial intelligence darling (its graphics processing units, or GPUs, are used to power AI systems). In fact, Nvidia's stock price has more than doubled this year -- after more than tripling in 2023. Its market cap now sits well over $3 trillion, more than Apple's or Microsoft's, and it alone accounts for more than one-third of the S&P 500's gains so far this year.\n\nDespite a dip in the stock price in 2022 -- when many big-time investors snapped up shares at a discount -- the company has provided a healthy shareholder return for awhile, significantly outperforming the broader market. One analyst says the semiconductor giant could see its market value soar to nearly $5 trillion in the coming year.\n\nThe question now is whether Nvidia can keep it up. Analysts have been ringing the warning bell on the stock being overpriced for a long time now; with it reaching new heights, those calls are growing louder.\n\nBecause the S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, the movements of companies like Nvidia -- either up or down -- can have an outsized impact on the overall performance of the broader market. Given retail investors are increasingly buying into these types of index funds, that could spell trouble.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the extreme concentration of returns in the S&P 500 makes investors more vulnerable to single headlines impacting the one stock driving index returns,\" Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k wrote in a note last week.\n\nStill, as Morningstar analysts outlined earlier this year, there are reasons to remain optimistic. The biggest tech companies in the world are the ones buying chips from Nvidia, and many other companies are ramping up their AI investments.\n\n\"It would not surprise me if a year from now, this is a thousand-dollar stock or more,\" Morningstar equity strategist Brian Colello said back in February.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alicia_adamczyk@fortune.com", "name": "Alicia Adamczyk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningstar,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morningstar, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Index fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Global_Management", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apollo Global Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155389188-e1718899281473.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-06-", "textStart": 280, "textEnd": 289}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Here's what we're watching on TheStreet today.\n\nStocks are on track for yet another winning week as Wall Street returns from the Juneteenth holiday. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both crossed new record highs on Tuesday.\n\nInvestors are reacting to weekly jobless claims - 238,000 Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, that's down from 243,000 the previous week.\n\nAnd in other news, Nvidia has officially surpassed Microsoft to become the most valuable public company in the world. Nvidia's market cap is roughly $3.4 trillion, just above Microsoft's $3.32 trillion dollar value. Apple trails closely behind at $3.27 trillion.\n\nBut this didn't happen overnight. After Nvidia saw its stock skyrocket 239 percent in 2023, shares have rallied another 181 percent so far in 2024.\n\nNvidia has $4 trillion value in sight as AI seen powering chip sales\n\nAnalyst resets Nvidia stock price target as CEO unveils new AI platform\n\nOver the last five years, the stock has shot up over 3,400 percent.\n\nNvidia announced a stock split earlier in June, making its shares more affordable for the everyday investor.\n\nMore importantly, demand for the stock is tied to Nvidia's dominance as the leader in the AI chip race. It controls 80 percent of the processor market by some estimates. The chipmaker recently announced its next generation chip slated for 2025 and a new platform called 'Rubin' slated for 2026.\n\nThat'll do it for your daily briefing.

It had lifted to sixth in the \"Sharesies Bundle\", which looks at the 50 most-owned instruments among its investors, based on the percentage they represent in portfolios.\n\nThere had been growth of 90 percent this year in the number of customers invested in Nvidia and 16 percent growth just in May.\n\n\"Buy-to-sell ratios have been over 1.5 - meaning for each dollar sold, 1.5 is bought - per week all week of June,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"This means we've seen growth in holdings driven by more than just the growth in share price, but also due to more investors investing, and those investors buying up more Nvidia shares.\"\n\nHead of retail and Devon Funds Management Greg Smith said there was still room for the share price to go higher.\n\nIts lift had been driven by real earnings growth, he said. \"There have been lofty expectations but they've been delivering on that. They've ridden the generative AI boom and it's getting real demand.\"\n\nHe said the question would be how well it held on to its roughly 80 percent market share.\n\nA share split had also helped the company, he said, because it made it more accessible to retail investors.\n\nThat also increased the chances it could be added to the Dow Jones, he said.\n\n\"They're all factors that could potentially drive it higher.

But Nvidia is an outlier, not just among chipmakers but AI hypebeasts in general, according to a new Financial Times analysis published Wednesday.\n\nOur regular readers will be pretty familiar with Nvidia's rise, but as a quick recap: Over the past 10 years, Nvidia's stock has gone up by around 28,000%. Over the same time period, Microsoft's stock went up a paltry 825%. But Nvidia's rise isn't because it builds verbose chatbots or uncanny image-generators; its value has skyrocketed because it underpins the physical supply chain behind generative AI products like OpenAI's Chat-GPT, so much so that the G7 may be preparing to step in. It's also a fairly simple case of good numbers, as Nvidia's revenue has seen consistent quarter-on-quarter revenue growth. In its most recent earnings report, Nvidia said revenue vaulted 18% compared to the previous quarter, and 262% year-over-year.\n\nBut Nvidia and its hardware do not reflect the reality for broader, more software-anchored AI companies, most of which remain technologies in search of a business model. The FT examined the stocks belonging to companies in Citi's \"AI Winners Basket\" and found that more than 50% of those firms have lost value this year -- a significant deflation given 75% of them rose in value in 2023. It also found AI investment funds have had a much more ambivalent 2024 than the year before, suggesting a broad downturn:\n\n\"When I ask our analysts outside the tech sector if they have significantly changed their cost or revenue projections as a result of AI, there's a lot of shrugging of shoulders, which says to me that this is evolution, not revolution,\" UBS chief strategist Bhanu Baweja told Bloomberg at the time.\n\nGoing Soft: Nvidia also has a soft side. This week it agreed to buy Shoreline, a startup that makes software for automatically tracking down and troubleshooting problems in computer systems. A source told Bloomberg the deal pegs Shoreline's valuation at $100 million, although neither company confirmed it. Nvidia is also an investor in Perplexity, which wants to make a Google-killing AI search engine -- but on Wednesday, Wired published a piece accusing Perplexity of scraping bits of the web (including Wired's own journalism) it said it wouldn't. The magazine also said Perplexity yielded seriously false answers to questions -- like wrongly summarizing a Wired article to say it accused a named police officer of committing a crime.

Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Thursday.\n\nAt this point, businesses are in a crazy race to incorporate AI into their infrastructure, and many CIOs fear they'll find themselves left behind. A new study from Pure Storage that surveyed 1,500 CIOs and IT decision makers found the overwhelming majority of companies -- 99.7% -- are either planning, preparing or currently adopting AI technology. And 93% of companies recognize AI as the most substantial opportunity for transforming their business. Two in five are even developing an AI-first strategy, in which AI is considered for everything new that the business wants to do.\n\nHowever, being CIOs, they're very aware of the state of their physical infrastructure environment. Infrastructure is the largest financial cost associated with adopting AI platforms -- 36% said it was their largest line item so far. More than eight in 10 CIOs said they believe the exponential multiplying of data needed to make AI systems operate will make them outgrow their current data centers. And infrastructure challenges may lead to business challenges. Just about the same amount of CIOs -- 80% -- are worried that if their infrastructure can't keep up with the pace of AI, their businesses will be left behind. Most CIOs -- 85% -- said they are re-examining their organization's infrastructure mix already, both due to rising cloud costs and increased data needs from AI. In two years, 40% projected that the cost of managing this new data would be their largest budgetary line item. Nearly three in 10 thought general infrastructure costs would be their biggest financial need. Recruiting talent and training staff are distant third and fourth fiscal priorities.\n\nBut there's also the fear that the speed of AI might cause companies to move too quickly, speeding development of a new application or platform without adequate time to make sure it's solid. More than a third of CIOs said one of the biggest risks currently impacting them was tech debt, which was second to cyberthreats and tied with managing multiple different system environments.\n\nSo what is a CIO to do? Clear-eyed assessments of everything needed for AI implementation are vital. Those should translate to honest and frank conversations with other executives. AI has great potential, but it can only get there if platforms are available, solid and consistent.\n\nWhen the SEC filed charges last fall against SolarWinds and its CISO following the massive cyber attack first reported in 2020, it marked a change in how boards and non-technical executives look at cybersecurity. Marshall Lux, a visiting fellow at Georgetown University's Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, wrote a paper on the changing relationship between boards and CIOs and CISOs. I talked to him about it, and an excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.\n\nVALUATIONS\n\nMove over, Microsoft and Apple. Nvidia is now the world's most valuable company. The AI chip maker first surpassed the top two tech giants on Tuesday and has stayed on top. Nvidia's stock has rallied in the last week on renewed excitement in the AI space -- largely fueled by Apple's announcement of its coming AI functions on its devices, analysts giving Microsoft much more upside and Nvidia's 10-for-one stock split that took place earlier this month. The only thing that slowed down Nvidia's run (as well as those of Microsoft and Apple, both of which had also reached record highs in the last week) was markets being closed Wednesday for the Juneteenth holiday. But it's skyrocketing ever higher today, hitting a $3.4 trillion valuation and inviting speculation on when it will become the first-ever $4 trillion company.\n\nWhile other companies are making AI platforms, Nvidia creates the chips needed to run those platforms and data. CNBC has estimated Nvidia controls between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market. Bloomberg supply chain data estimates that Microsoft actually makes up 15% of Nvidia's revenue. Sequoia Capital estimated in March that companies have spent $50 billion on Nvidia chips to train LLMs, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nAnd that doesn't include Nvidia's soon-to-come Blackwell platform, which includes the most powerful chips ever created. At the time they were announced in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang -- now the world's 11th richest person -- said the company already had commitments to use the new chips from Amazon Web Services, Dell Technologies, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI, Oracle, Tesla and xAI. So even if AI platform development hits a slow patch, Nvidia is set to continue its meteoric rise in valuation and revenue.\n\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nSome of the features in Microsoft's new AI suite are getting a reboot. The company has decided to postpone the full release of its Recall feature, which autosaved screenshots of a person's computer activity -- giving something for an AI assistant to pull from when a user is trying to remember things like the name of that report they were reading yesterday afternoon. Forbes senior contributor Barry Collins writes that the Recall database, which stored all of those screenshots, was left unencrypted, meaning any hacker could easily access sensitive data, including credit card numbers, passwords and bank information. Collins writes that within days of discovering this flaw, security researchers were demonstrating malicious code that could extract that information.\n\nFor its part, Microsoft made some quick changes to Recall before it was scheduled to ship its new AI PCs to the public. Recall would be turned off by default, people using the feature would need to pass an authentication before pulling up the information, and the database would be fully encrypted. But then the company decided not to release Recall at all just yet, in order \"to ensure the experience meets our high standards for quality and security,\" Microsoft wrote on its Windows Experience blog.\n\nCollins spoke to several experts about whether this initial misstep will sink Recall's full launch, presumably in a much-improved version. Wes Miller, a research analyst with Directions on Microsoft, said it \"likely turned many users off to the feature, and likely doomed any use of it en masse within organizations that must maintain a truly robust approach to security, compliance and risk.\"\n\nLEGAL ISSUES\n\nWhile many court and investigative reports are open to the public, others are confidential -- and for good reason. Courts handle messy personal issues including domestic abuse, divorce and child custody, and the majority of the information about these cases is not for public disclosure. But last fall, Forbes senior writer Emily Baker-White reports, a security researcher was made aware of a massive flaw in some county court and law enforcement systems in Florida that allowed potentially millions of confidential records to be accessed online. The security researcher met limited success when they reported the flaws to the departments, and everything was only fixed after they posted a detailed blog about some of the issues. Experts told Forbes that when it comes to cybersecurity, many smaller government entities don't have large budgets or time to pay close attention to detail. And while some of these breaches were just the result of a proverbial weak link in the security chain, it serves as a good reminder to test and retest security. After all, cybersecurity attacks and hacker use of personal information is becoming more sophisticated, and this data could easily be turned against ordinary people.\n\nBITS + BYTES\n\nGeorgetown University Visiting Fellow Marshall Lux On Boards' Relationship With Cybersecurity\n\nIn 2019, hackers inserted malicious code into an update that was pushed out by software company SolarWinds, which ended up breaching systems in more than 30,000 public and private organizations, including local, state and federal agencies. Last October, the Security and Exchange Commission announced it had filed charges against both SolarWinds and its CISO, accusing them of making misleading statements about its cybersecurity program, failing to disclose its knowledge of the breaches and failing to have internal controls to protect its assets.\n\nThese charges, which were the first against an individual from the SEC, have changed the dynamic between company boards, executives, and those tasked with cybersecurity. Marshall Lux, a visiting fellow at Georgetown University's Psaros Center for Financial Markets and Policy, wrote a paper examining how this relationship is changing. I talked to him about his takeaways, and what needs to be done for companies to protect their data and reputations. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.\n\nHow have the SolarWinds attack and proliferation of cybersecurity incidents impacted the relationship between a company's CISO and its board and execs?\n\nLux: I think CISOs are very front and center now. A lot of my meetings, the CISO comes in and reports to the board every month or every quarter. I think the board is taking a hard look at CISOs and saying, 'Are they up to the job?' I think there's enormous need for board training, for board tools, for board metrics. The regulators are requiring people to address proficiency and to monitor it and be accountable.\n\nThe issue with SolarWinds: At the end of the day, it was a wake up call. There was fraud, right? It was not reported. So boards got the joke. They need to make sure things are reported, revealed, in 8-Ks, all the rest. But that's, in some ways, icing on the cake. Now, you have to have knowledge, you have to have committees, you have to have the right people in the jobs. You have to be aware of the tools. You have to make sure the reporting is [being done].\n\nWhen an event happens, all of a sudden it's like, 'Oh, shit.' If it happens repeatedly, I think the market discounts people. They say this institution keeps getting attacked. What's wrong with them? The headline risk is huge. The reputational damage is huge. The customer nuisance is large. Get some letters to millions of customers, they get free access to credit bureaus, all the rest. It's a real pain.\n\nBased on the reality that we have right now, what do you think the ideal relationship should be between the CISO, the board and the CEO? How much knowledge do board members and executives need to have on cybersecurity issues?\n\nI think the board needs to have a basic and increasingly more sophisticated level of knowledge. There will have to be a technology committee that looks at cyber and technology. That's kind-of new to a lot of companies. You usually have your audit, your risk, your comp, your governance. You need a technology committee, in my view, especially if a company spends a lot on technology. You need to take a hard look at your CISO and say, 'Are they up to the job?' You need to have metrics.\n\nA lot of times you see people presenting stuff, and frankly, it's a bit technical. People will say stuff: we've got production data, non-production data. Peoples' eyes glaze over and they say, 'Okay, that sounds good.' I've chaired technology committees where we take enormous time taking documents and saying, 'What does this say?' How does a board member, who may have spent a career in [a field like] retail have the knowledge to be able to understand that? Make [it] plain English. Just make me understand what the risks are.\n\nThen you have to have risk frameworks. You have to have cyber frameworks. It's all of the basic stuff. As often is the case with Moore's law, as soon as you get it, it's going to become 100 times more complicated. And so you need continual education. As I said, several times a month I see data, and you say, 'Okay, let me understand. Why is that different? How was that changing things?' There are now databases of dark pool information. Things that you can go down and understand where is there bad data?\n\nAlso this stuff can happen anywhere. You can have one server get infected, and your whole technology rots. So you've got to be ultra vigilant. You've got to look at every possible opening. There's a lot of data out there that you can use, and it's just going to be a very fast moving area.\n\nThere are always new risks coming up. How can a CISO keep the board feeling comfortable with the way things are when risks keep multiplying?\n\nI'm a big believer in call it out. It's okay to scare a board. The worst secret thing you can do is go to a board and say everything is fine if it's not fine. As a risk person, your primary allegiance is not just to the CEO, it's to the board. So if there's a disagreement, if you're being challenged, call it out. In executive sessions, just have a session with the CISO. Excuse the CEO. Just tell me what you're concerned about. You're not going to lose your job if you say the truth. If you say, 'I need more help. I need more resources. I need to report back to you more,' I think it's tremendously beneficial.\n\n9: Number of arrests made in the operation by Spanish authorities\n\n30+: How many languages various websites targeted in the operation used to spread directives and slogans of the Islamic State\n\n'Enable terrorist organizations and violent extremists to bypass the enhanced moderation and content removal efforts': What Europol said these websites did\n\nThe hazards of eye strain from too much time looking at a screen are real.

Nvidia, headed by the Taiwanese tycoon Jensen Huang, started out back in 1993 producing computer chips to make video games more realistic.\n\nBut it spotted early how tech-nology was changing and invested heavily in making its computer chips incredibly fast and powerful.\n\nThese processors are now in huge demand to help power data centres and run complex computing tasks required by AI firms.\n\nNvidia's share price really started rocketing as awareness of AI grew -- helped by OpenAI's ChatGPT, which it powers.\n\nA single chip costs between $25,000 and $40,000 and Facebook's Meta has said it will buy 350,000 this year alone.\n\nCrucially, Nvidia's strength has been due to it being so far ahead of the game that investors are betting few can catch up. One analyst quipped: \"There's a war going on in AI and Nvidia is the only arms dealer.\"\n\nNvidia's share price has risen by an incredible 591,078 per cent since it first started trading on the US stock market in 1999. If an investor had backed the firm with $10,000 (\u00a37,850) they'd have made almost $50million (\u00a339million).\n\nWhich makes the firm's name rather apt -- as it comes from \"Invidia\", Latin for envy.\n\nNVIDIA president Jensen Huang is now such a superstar in the tech world that he gets asked to sign women's chests.\n\nThat was the situation he found himself in, left, at a recent computer conference in Taipei.

Statutory profits were down 42.8 per cent to \u00a320.7million on the back of its takeover of CITY PUB GROUP.\n\nMr Dodd said it had faced \u00a37million of extra staffing costs from higher wages, but its own RAM AGENCY had cut costs by \u00a31million as it fills \u00adflexible shifts with its own chefs and bartenders.\n\nTHE maker of Warhammer model miniatures is handing \u00a318million to its staff after a boost in sales.\n\nGAMES WORKSHOP said it expected profits to rise from \u00a3171million to at least \u00a3200million this year, while sales should be 10 per cent higher at \u00a3445million. The firm is awarding 2,600 staff around \u00a36,900 as part of its profit share scheme.\n\nGames Workshop, which sells \u00a340 character figurines, is one of London's most surprising success stories, with a \u00a33.3billion market valuation.\n\nRESTAURANT owners are urging the next government to overhaul the blighted business rates system and create an \"Office for Small Business\".\n\nAbout 1,500 small restaurants have signed a letter by take-away firm JUST EAT, urging changes to help the \u00a371billion hospitality industry.

However, Wall Street's attention is now turning to a once-seemingly mythical target: the race to $4 trillion.\n\nOn paper, NVDA stock has an excellent chance of reaching the mark first. As The Street pointed out, it only took the tech juggernaut 74 trading sessions to pad its market value with another trillion, putting it above the $3 trillion level. Further, Nvidia represents the clear leader so far in the graphics processors that undergird advanced artificial intelligence (AI) protocols.\n\nAs such, Wedbush analysts remarked that Nvidia's processors represent \"in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector.\" In their view, more businesses will start embracing the burgeoning innovation, leading to more demand for Nvidia chips.\n\nWedbush experts did present some caution to the blistering narrative underlying NVDA stock, citing possible disruptions of near-term sales cycles in some tech enterprises. However, they also believe that a \"massive\" wave of expenditures will boost the AI sector, fueling a possible \"industrial revolution\" in the tech ecosystem.\n\n\"In a nutshell, we believe this tech bull market has legs that will ultimately broaden out to the rest of software, consumer tech, cyber security, semis, and infrastructure over the next 12 to 18 months,\" the analysts remarked.\n\nSpecifically, Wedbush's Dan Ives believes that \"the race to $4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft.\" However, it's possible NVDA stock may have the edge, with generative AI applications all going through Nvidia.\n\nStill, not everyone is convinced. As Julia Angwin of The New York Times mentioned, a little over a year ago, a group of researchers asked for a hiatus in developing large-scale AI systems due to fears of uncontrollable power. Right now, \"the question isn't really whether A.I. is too smart and will take over the world. It's whether A.I. is too stupid and unreliable to be useful,\" Angwin stated.\n\nNotably, while Nvidia has beaten its bottom-line earnings estimates in the past four quarters, the positive surprise has declined from 28.6% in Q2 fiscal 2024 to 8.9% in Q1 fiscal 2025.", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_enomoto@investorplace.com", "name": "Josh Enomoto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Industrial Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Angwin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julia Angwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Information_Technology/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Information Technology/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nvda1600-4.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

At the time of this writing, NVDA stock is down approximately 3%, with investors appearing to be taking some profits after an incredible run in the technology sector.\n\nThis move in NVDA stock is partly responsible for the downside investors are seeing in the Nasdaq Composite today. Down more than 0.8% this afternoon, it does appear that valuation is starting to matter for investors considering whether to put fresh capital to work in the tech sector.\n\nAmong the catalysts driving bearish momentum today is commentary from Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) former CEO, who implied that some similarities may exist between Nvidia now and Cisco during the height of the dot-com bubble. While he did imply that Nvidia may be quite different due to its size and the potential size of the artificial intelligence (AI) market, this is certainly something to explore.\n\nLet's dive into what to make of this take -- and whether Nvidia remains a buy.\n\nGiven how far and fast Nvidia has surged this year, some concerns around NVDA stock trading in bubble territory are certainly warranted. The stock is now trading near 80 times earnings and, while its forward multiple is a lot lower, the question is whether future growth expectations will materialize.\n\nOf course, some amount of demand has likely been pulled forward, as companies and institutions ramp up ordering to meet expected demand for their AI applications. However, as with every megatrend in the market, the future is uncertain. And right now, investors are clearly questioning whether Nvidia's growth rate can continue at this pace and for how long.\n\nI don't think Nvidia will see the kind of growth slowdown Cisco saw during the dot-com bubble. And, over the very long term, investors who continued to dollar cost average into CSCO stock did do okay (even though it took decades for shares to stage an eventual recovery).\n\nAll told, the AI trend appears to be a real long-term tailwind for the markets. I tend to agree with the former Cisco CEO that these two companies are likely more different to each other at their respective peaks than they are similar.", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_macdonald@investorplace.com", "name": "Chris MacDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq_Composite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq Composite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/nvda-1600.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

While Nvidia isn't just limited to gaming, it's one of the primary reasons for its widespread success. The company is responsible for supplying GPUs, which have been serving the gaming world for more than three decades. Amidst all this success for the company, a Reddit thread comes to mind epitomizing the complex relationship between Nvidia and gamers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHigh-end Nvidia GPUs are expensive, but this doesn't deter gamers from buying them. Sometimes, people become so obsessed with high-end GPUs that it becomes the only topic they talk about. This has led to the inception of many popular memes over the years, and the Reddit thread perfectly encapsulates the spirit.\n\nA Dad Posts a Hilarious Photo of Son Wearing a Nvidia Box\n\nA Reddit user posted a photo of his son wearing a cardboard, which seems to be the outer box for an RTX 3090 GPU. The user subsequently titled the thread \"My son's sad attempt at getting me to love him,\" which made the whole gaming community chuckle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith Starfield Choosing AMD FSR, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 Nvidia DLSS Update Gives Many GeForce Owners a New Lifeline\n\nThe Reddit thread quickly became a zone for jokes and one-liners, with everyone sharing witty comments. Some resorted to technicalities with their jokes, while some appreciated the effort put in by the son to garner the attention of his dad.\n\nOne user even created an entire table comparing his son with an RTX 3090. Interestingly, many users were surprised that the dad managed to get an RTX 3090, and rightfully so, as it was a hot commodity when the image was posted.\n\nWhether it was as a top humor or just a fickle joke on the dad's part, the Reddit post did manage to garner a lot of attention. It also reminded everyone how integral Nvidia is to the gaming community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNvidia Rises to the Top and Will Likely Stay There a While\n\nFounded in 1993, Nvidia is now the world's most valuable company, with its share price climbing to an all-time high on Tuesday. The current valuation of the company is $3.34tn, which is more than that of the tech giants Microsoft and Apple. The company has been dominating the gaming space for a while now, but it is also a global leader in AI hardware and software.\n\nDoes Starfield Run Just as Smoothly on Non-AMD GPUs? Expert Analysis Will Devastate Nvidia Users\n\nAs AI becomes more mainstream, the company is expected to continue its growth trajectory. What's interesting is that eight years ago, the stock price was 1% of its current value. At that point, Nvidia was majorly competing with AMD in the GPU segment, but now the company is also an AI innovator.\n\nOf course, Nvidia is still going to focus on GPUs as they recently launched new cards in the RTX 40 series. These cards are based on Ada Lovelace Architecture and, as one would expect, are proficient in AI tasks as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you think Nvidia will stay at the top for a while?

However, Nvidia's meteoric rise has recently fueled skepticism from bears, drawing parallels to the dot-com bubble of 1995 to 2000.\n\nSpeaking to this point, Morningstar strategist Brian Colello believes Nvidia's stock is fairly valued at $105 per share after its 10-for-1 stock split went into effect on June 10. Nonetheless, the GPU-titan's shares have already jumped to $136 a little over a week post-split, putting it in overvalued territory, according to Colello.\n\nIs Nvidia's stock really overvalued? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nFrom a fundamental perspective, Nvidia's stock appears to be in bubble territory. The company's shares trade at 52 times forward earnings, significantly higher than the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.55 and price-to-sales ratio of over 42 are well above the averages for technology stocks and the semiconductor industry, respectively. These traditional valuation metrics paint a picture of an extremely overvalued stock.\n\nHowever, a fundamental analysis may not be the most appropriate approach in this case. Generative AI holds the potential to fundamentally reshape the global economy. AI is poised to radically enhance worker productivity and create entirely new markets, possibly unlocking trillions of dollars in value across all sectors of the global economy.\n\nThe economic potential of AI is astounding. McKinsey & Co. estimates that generative AI could unlock up to $17.7 trillion in economic value, while Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang believes the global AI economy is on pace to eventually top $100 trillion.\n\nTo put this into perspective, Nvidia's current market cap stands at $3.35 trillion, which may seem astronomical at first glance but is a drop in the bucket when compared to where the global economy is headed in the age of AI.\n\nSome analysts have argued that rivals like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel may enjoy a windfall from AI-centric companies diversifying their hardware-sourcing requirements in the years ahead, but the reality is far more complex. Nvidia's GPUs and complementary CUDA platform are simply too far ahead of the competition, especially with a full-on arms race occurring in AI.\n\nCore AI developers don't have the luxury of switching to a competing platform at this critical juncture, despite the risks associated with overreliance on a single chip designer. In other words, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel might be able to carve out a rather profitable niche in AI-capable chips but aren't going to significantly erode Nvidia's market share among the most important developers driving the bus, so to speak.\n\nWhile Nvidia's stock may appear expensive and overvalued based on traditional metrics, it's essential to consider the company's central position in the AI revolution. With automation and an abundance of intelligence on track to redraw the global economy within a few short years, Nvidia's bull run is likely just getting started.\n\nAs such, the fearmongering over another dot-com-type bubble seems wholly unwarranted. It also grossly underestimates the transformative potential of this technology that many think will be the most important invention in the history of humanity.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "george_budwell@fool.com", "name": "George Budwell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dot-com bubble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morningstar,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morningstar, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jensen_Huang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jensen Huang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Value (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKinsey_&_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McKinsey & Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CUDA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niche_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Niche market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronomy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/781076/price-vs-value-scale.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 626, "textEnd": 633}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Here's What History Says Happens Next. | The Motley Fool", "body": "Now that its stock is the world's most valuable (based on market cap), many investors likely are wondering if they should sell or continue holding. Some who are on the sidelines might even wonder if it's too late to buy. Perhaps history can be a guide to making these decisions.\n\nWhen it comes to the most valuable stock listed on a U.S. exchange, there have been four other companies that have worn the crown over the last 30 years: General Electric, which is now GE Aerospace (GE 1.07%), Microsoft, ExxonMobil (XOM 0.94%), and Apple (AAPL -1.10%). And investors might be pleasantly surprised by what happened to these stocks after reaching the top.\n\nOn Sept. 15, 1998, Microsoft passed General Electric to become the most valuable stock for the first time. According to data from the nonprofit American Business History Center, General Electric had been the top company without interruption for several years.\n\nFor its part, Microsoft sat by itself at the top of the leaderboard for a couple of years. Moreover, the stock more than doubled less than two years after it initially passed General Electric.\n\nThis is the first lesson from history: Once a company reaches the top, it tends to stay at the top for multiple years. That was the case for General Electric and Microsoft.\n\nAnd it was also the case for ExxonMobil and Apple. Therefore, if it follows the historical pattern, Nvidia stock will also likely enjoy a prolonged period at the top.\n\nOnce a company initially becomes the most valuable, history shows the stock price usually hasn't peaked yet. For example, ExxonMobil topped General Electric in February 2005. From there, the oil company's stock would rise another 60% over the next couple of years and 75% over the following decade.\n\nApple passed ExxonMobil in August 2011. In the five years leading up to taking the top spot, the stock was up around 500%, which is spectacular. Many investors likely thought they had missed the boat. But the stock didn't stop there: It doubled again over the subsequent five years.\n\nTherefore, if history is any guide, Nvidia stock could enjoy multiple years at the top and continue increasing in value.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing from history is that the previous most valuable stocks outperformed the S&P 500 for the next five years after they reached the top.\n\nReturn data according to YCharts. Chart by author. *Alpha refers to a stock's performance relative to a benchmark (in this case, the S&P 500) and is designated in terms of percentage-point difference.\n\nIt's important to zoom out and consider why this is true. It's because a company doesn't just become the world's most valuable for no reason. Something good must be happening with the business. And whatever trends are in the company's favor tend to last for multiple years, at least.\n\nFor Microsoft, it rode the PC revolution to take the top spot. ExxonMobil benefited from an extreme and prolonged spike in oil prices. And Apple was at the front of the smartphone trend. These were material drivers of each business that played out over years, not days.\n\nNvidia is benefiting from the surging adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Even if there's a lot of over-the-top hype with this trend, important things are happening in AI, and many businesses are likely to continue experimenting with the technology's application in the coming years. This means that business could stay good for Nvidia, leading to more market-beating gains.\n\nAs an investor who places a strong emphasis on value, the valuation of Nvidia stock personally makes me quite nervous. The market cap is over $3 trillion, and it trades at an extreme price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 42. In the history of the stock market, there has never been a company this big that sported a valuation this high. For perspective, Nvidia's valuation is currently triple the valuation of Microsoft in the second-place spot.\n\nMy discomfort with the valuation aside, I can't deny that history says Nvidia stock hasn't peaked yet. It could stay at the top for multiple years. And it could outperform the S&P 500 from here as the AI trend continues to play out.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_quast@fool.com", "name": "Jon Quast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ExxonMobil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Electric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_Alpha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DEC Alpha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Education and Training", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/781005/young-man-sitting-pensively-at-his-computer-looking-thoughtfully-at-the-screen-in-front-of-him.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665188", "eventUri": "eng-9665188", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1998-09-15", "textStart": 655, "textEnd": 669}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-02-", "textStart": 1609, "textEnd": 1622}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-08-", "textStart": 1776, "textEnd": 1787}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

This rise comes amid a broader reshuffling in the tech hierarchy.\n\nEarlier this year, Apple lost its top position to Microsoft due to concerns over iPhone demand, which affected its stock performance.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft made significant progress with its investments in new technologies, such as its early stake in OpenAI, which boosted its standing in generative AI.\n\nHowever, recent interest in Nvidia, especially after a 10-to-1 stock split, has overshadowed Microsoft's performance.\n\nThe stock split lowered Nvidia's share price to 10% of its previous value, making it more accessible to a wider range of investors, which in turn has catapulted them into the most valuable company.\n\nDespite Nvidia's current dominance, Microsoft isn't giving up. The company's stock reached a record high just a day before Nvidia's rise, though it dipped slightly by 0.45% the next day.\n\nHowever, a reversal looks possible as Microsoft's stock has surged by 7.6% in June, with an 18% growth year-to-date.\n\nThis solid performance was highlighted by a breakout on June 11, indicating potential for more upward movement.\n\nSuch breakouts often signal strong buying interest that can push stocks past long-standing resistance levels. For Microsoft, the next key resistance is at $500, suggesting significant growth potential if the current momentum continues.\n\nAfter the closing bell on Tuesday, June 18, the stock closed at $446.34, trading down by 0.45%.\n\nThis article is from an unpaid external contributor.

It made high-end, specialized graphics chips for gamers, the kind who liked to take apart their PCs and tweak their motherboards. But, it turned out, these niche processors could do something else really well: handle all the complex work needed for artificial-intelligence programs like OpenAI's Dall-E image generator and its text bot ChatGPT.\n\nThat has put Nvidia at the center of the AI boom -- powering not just Sam Altman's company but Tesla, Meta, and every other Silicon Valley copycat. This year, Nvidia's value in the stock market has nearly tripled to nearly $3.3 trillion, making the company the most valuable in the world -- larger than both Apple and Microsoft. Recently, Intelligencer spoke with an Nvidia engineer in his late 20s. In December and May, when the company reported extraordinary processor sales in its quarterly earnings reports, his net worth jumped hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhen I joined in 2021, Nvidia was prestigious in that it was a well-known name, but it wasn't as competitive as Google and nowhere near as competitive as Meta. The perks have always been very bare. You can't get free lunch -- it's not like Google. And the cafeteria is only open till 2 p.m., but at Google I think it's open all day. They just restarted the San Francisco shuttle, and we don't get any commuter benefits. Plus it's a hardware company, which is different from internet companies. But now, we're getting so many applications for the few positions that we have that it's impossible to look through all the r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. We're probably going to be very competitive now.\n\nWatching the stock price go up was absolutely crazy. I definitely did not expect this to happen. I had thought of Nvidia as a gaming company -- I had thought, Maybe it could keep growing. Obviously, it's not a gaming company anymore.\n\nMy cash salary is just over $200,000; most of my comp is in equity. The first time the stock price shot up, I was doing the numbers in my head, like, Okay, if the average price for next year is $400, I'm gonna make $450,000 next year. That's amazing. But the average is going to be less than $400. It's not going to stay there. That was how I was thinking about it. Then, each time, the price just kept going up. After the December earnings last year, I didn't have any more. I thought, Clearly, they're not bullshitting and this is just gonna keep going. Currently I have $1.6 million in unvested shares that will vest over the next 18 months. After taxes, that should net another $800,000. If I had kept every share I was ever given, I believe I'd have an extra $1 million, possibly less.\n\nI could not believe it. I always had the sense that I would never get lucky with the stock market. A few investments I made I lost a bunch of money on. My last company tanked right before I joined. I thought, Okay, it's fine. I'll just work for a wage, and I don't need to get lucky. I could not believe my luck. I still feel that way every quarter. I sometimes do the math of how much I get paid per month with stock included, and the number is crazy. Plus I love working at Nvidia. It's super-interesting. I don't work on the GPU directly, more like a research-y project. I get to open a textbook -- which I never did in my old job -- and read up on the algorithms. And I don't really work that hard either, like 30, 35 hours a week.\n\nWhen the Nvidia stock was going down in 2022, there would be a tinge in the air at work; people were not happy about it. Now, everyone's cheerful, happy. It's kind of funny, though -- at the office, we never talk about it. Maybe right after earnings, my manager will say something like, \"Obviously, we've been doing really well.\" I have one close friend who I've talked to about it, but you don't want to jinx it, I guess. Plus you don't know how much stock everyone else has. I think people with longer tenure with higher-level roles probably are doing great. They will get retirement money out of this, even if they diversified from Nvidia.\n\nWhen Nvidia became the largest publicly-traded company in the world, I took screenshots of the stock price and sent it to my mom and girlfriend. It was pretty great. It's kind of unbelievable. I also talked to one work friend about it. We were both pretty psyched. People at the company are silently happy.\n\nOutside of work, it can be annoying when people hear I work there -- they ask when I joined and try to guess how rich I am. This is gonna sound really douchey, but if someone asked me where I went to school, it's a little bit awkward for me to say because it's a big name. And this is sort of similar. If you say you're working at Nvidia, they're like, \"Ooooh, okay. That's who I'm talking to? How about that stock, man?\"\n\nMy parents are both highly educated, but I grew up middle class. My mom makes money but not a lot. I got into college on full financial aid, and I am paying for my sister to attend college at the moment. Until recently, I'd try to spend under $100 a day, maximum. But I've been failing. I've been going out whenever I want. I've been splurging, and It's going to be a problem. I've been buying a lot of very nice gifts for people. For my girlfriend, I've gotten a couple of pieces of nice jewelry -- very reasonable stuff, no gemstones or anything. My sister gets more age-appropriate stuff. Shoes. I got her a MacBook -- she needs it for school. Once a month, I've been taking my girlfriend to a nice restaurant -- one Michelin star, not the three Michelin stars. I just don't get the value prop, you know? Those are like $2,000 for two people, but for one star, it's like $800, $900. Every now and then, I take everyone traveling. I took my mom to Napa and stayed at a very, very nice hotel. I would have never been able to stay there -- $1,200 or something.\n\nI grew up abroad, and my mom still lives in that country, so I go there like twice a year. I really enjoy flying business class. I don't want to fly economy ever again; I just don't want to touch shoulders and share an armrest, you know? So the new expense would be flying business to Europe. Those tickets are, like, $6,000 or something. So far this year, I've spent about $30,000 on my sister's tuition. $11,000 for travel. $14,000 for restaurants and bars. And then $8,000 shopping. Jesus Christ. I need to slow down.\n\nTo be honest, I don't feel rich. It's relaxed me a lot and made homeownership a possibility in the near future, but it's not like I'm loaded now. I certainly can't retire on the amount of money. Being unmarried with no kids, I now feel comfortable flying business and staying at high-end hotels, but I could not do any of that if I had kids. I'm renting an apartment in downtown S.F. I could comfortably buy a $2 million house by putting down $800,000 and getting a mortgage for the rest, but renting seems like a much better option.\n\nWhat kind of life do I see for myself? I don't really have an answer to that. I'd like at least two kids, maybe three to four. My goal has always been to have $5 million for retirement. I might stay at Nvidia if I got a couple more promotions, but I plan on moving to NYC when the equity cliff hits in 2026. I hate how soulless the peninsula is and how far San Francisco has been allowed to deteriorate. I still like S.F., but it's not a quarter of the city it used to be and there's no indication problems are gonna fix themselves. Like a cultural dead zone, you know? My parents have some friends in the area. When I visit, it's this race to politely humblebrag about your last vacation or where your kid got into college or whatever. That's not how I grew up. I wouldn't want to raise kids in that environment. In fact, it would be ideal if my kids thought we were poor, just not going to school with superrich people. And by superrich I mean anyone who has a $3 million home in Menlo Park.\n\nThe school I went to had a lot of smart, ambitious people. Way more ambitious than me. A bunch of my friends were loaded through their parents and then some of them immediately went to Google. I was more middle of the road. I don't need to prove myself to anyone anymore. I feel great.

Therefore, a R1,000 investment in Nvidia would be worth 45,945% more than a decade ago.\n\nThe table below shows how much a decade-long R1,000 investment in Nvidia would have been worth on Tuesday, 18 June 2024, taking into account the rand's devaluation.\n\nAn investor who bought R1,000 of Nvidia would also have seen a much better return than those who placed the same amount into the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's Top 40 biggest listed companies.\n\nThe JSE Top 40 index closed at R45,723.15 on 18 June 2014.\n\nOn 18 June 2024, the index closed at R72,863.74 -- 59.36% higher than a decade ago.\n\nA R1,000 investment in the top 40 companies in the JSE would be worth R1,593.60.\n\nThat works out to a compound annual growth rate of 4.77%, lower than the average rate of inflation in South Africa over the same period.\n\nIn addition, the rand has weakened significantly over this period, so the true value of the increase is even less.\n\nThe graph below compares the value of a R1,000 investment in Nvidia and the JSE Top 40 over the past ten years.\n\nThe top (blue) line shows the change if an investor bought only Nvidia shares, while the bottom (orange) line shows the change if they bought R1,000 of the JSE Top 40.", "source": {"uri": "mybroadband.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyBroadband"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hanno_labuschagne@mybroadband.co.za", "name": "Hanno

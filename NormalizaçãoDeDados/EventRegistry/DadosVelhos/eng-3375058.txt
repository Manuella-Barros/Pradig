Funding for the wind farm is provided by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD), a leading national entity supporting global socio-economic development initiatives.\n\nThe 50 MW wind farm takes its name from the southern Omani governorate, the largest of the Sultanate's 11 governorates, and will electrify an estimated 16,000 homes and offset 110,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year.\n\nCommenting on the signing ceremony, Mohamed Jameel al Ramahi, Chief Executive Officer of Masdar, said: \"Oman has immense untapped potential in renewable energy, particularly in solar and wind. Masdar is proud to be supporting the historically close ties between the UAE and the Sultanate by providing our experience and expertise from delivering cutting-edge renewable energy solutions across the world.\n\n\"The Dhofar Wind Power Project will play an important role in supporting the diversification of Oman's energy mix, while providing a reliable source of clean power to serve its growing population and economy.\"\n\nSaleh bin Nasser al Rumhi, Chief Executive Officer of RAECO, added: \"We are pleased to be supporting this project and the construction of the Dhofar Wind Power Project, which will be launched after signing of the project development agreement with Masdar in 2014.\"\n\n\"This project represents a fundamental shift in clean energy projects in the region and in the Sultanate in particular. It is the first project of its kind in the Gulf region and will offset 110,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions,\" he added.\n\n\"The signing of this agreement signifies a major step in the development of the Dhofar Wind Power Project and is testimony to the strong relationship between the Sultanate of Oman and the UAE. We look forward to the signing of other associated agreements related to the project this October.\"\n\nMohammed Saif al Suwaidi, Director-General of ADFD, noted, \"We are proud to fund the Dhofar Wind Power Project, the first of its kind in Oman with its innovative technology and which upon completion will contribute to the Sultanate's position as a clean energy leader in the region and will represent seven per cent of the total installed power generation capacity in the Dhofar Governorate, including its capital city Salalah, a major port and free zone\".\n\n\"In addition, it will help facilitate greater knowledge transfer in renewable energy between the UAE and Oman. Today, this multi-partner initiative is another strategic clean energy endeavour ADFD is pleased to support.\"\n\nGE will lead the EPC consortium, and will provide the project's 13 wind turbines powered by the company's latest 3.8MW wind turbine generator solution.\n\nTSK will support the consortium partners with the construction of the balance of plant.\n\nFor Masdar, this is yet another milestone in the field of wind energy after having developed the 117MW Tafila wind farm in Jordan, the Middle East's first utility-scale wind power project.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:09:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.8941176533699036, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3375058", "time": "04:09:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375058", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "1", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "67", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "172", "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "8573", "label": {"eng": "\u015eal\u0101lah"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salalah", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "\u015eal\u0101lah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "8861", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302718", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "score": 4}, {"id": "302999", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Technology"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "score": 2}, {"id": "303165", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Energy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy", "score": 5}, {"id": "303206", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "score": 5}, {"id": "303212", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "score": 4}, {"id": "303301", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "score": 2}, {"id": "304167", "label": {"eng": "Persian Gulf"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 2}, {"id": "305534", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "score": 3}, {"id": "305536", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "score": 3}, {"id": "309701", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "score": 2}, {"id": "309800", "label": {"eng": "Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperation_Council_for_the_Arab_States_of_the_Gulf", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "309831", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "score": 1}, {"id": "311969", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "score": 3}, {"id": "312064", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "General Electric"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric", "score": 3}, {"id": "313841", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sultan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan", "score": 5}, {"id": "324104", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Megawatt"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#Megawatt", "score": 3}, {"id": "324110", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "score": 5}, {"id": "441822", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Masdar"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masdar", "score": 5}, {"id": "555062", "label": {"eng": "Dhofar Governorate"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhofar_Governorate", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 5}, {"id": "1006697", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Governorates of Oman"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Oman", "score": 3}], "image": "https://i1.wp.com/omanobserver.om/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1088531.jpg?fit=800%2C550", "timeCrawl": "04:09:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "First wind farm project to electrify 16,000 homes - Oman Observer", "originalArticle": null}

Masdar is proud to be supporting the historically close ties between the UAE and the Sultanate by providing our experience and expertise from delivering cutting-edge renewable energy solutions across the world. The Dhofar Wind Power Project will play an important role in supporting the diversification of Oman's energy mix, while providing a reliable source of clean power to serve its growing population and economy.\"\n\nSaleh Bin Nasser Al Rumhi, chief executive officer of RAECO, said, \"We are pleased to be supporting this project and the construction of the Dhofar Wind Power Project, which will be launched after signing of the project development agreement with Masdar in 2014.\"\n\n\"This project represents a fundamental shift in clean energy projects in the region and in the Sultanate in particular. It is the first project of its kind in the Gulf region and will offset 110,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n\"The signing of this agreement signifies a major step in the development of the Dhofar Wind Power Project and is testimony to the strong relationship between the Sultanate of Oman and the UAE. We look forward to the signing of other associated agreements related to the project this October,\" he added.\n\nMohammed Saif Al Suwaidi, director general of ADFD said: \"We are proud to fund the Dhofar Wind Power Project, the first of its kind in Oman with its innovative technology and which upon completion will contribute to the Sultanate's position as a clean energy leader in the region and will represent seven per cent of the total installed power generation capacity in the Dhofar governorate, including its capital city Salalah, a major port and free zone.\"\n\n\"Over the past four and a half decades, the Fund has been an instrumental and integral global development aid entity committed to supporting sustainable economic growth around the world,\" he added.\n\n\"This 50 MW project will not only serve as a model of modern power generation but more importantly, demonstrate the commercial viability of wind technology in the Sultanate. In addition, it will help facilitate greater knowledge transfer in renewable energy between the UAE and Oman. Today, this multi-partner initiative is another strategic clean energy endeavour ADFD is pleased to support,\" Al Suwaidi concluded.\n\nGE will lead the EPC consortium, and will provide the project's 13 wind turbines powered by the company's latest 3.8MW wind turbine generator solution. Built upon the technology of its predecessors, the turbine represents the latest development in GE's wind turbine platform, increasing both annual energy production and flexibility in operation. TSK will support the consortium partners with the construction of the balance of plant.\n\nFor Masdar, this is yet another milestone in the field of wind energy after having developed the 117MW Tafila wind farm in Jordan, the Middle East's first utility-scale wind power project.

Some of the renewable energy sources include: solar, biomass, hydroelectric energy and geothermal power while non-renewable energy are such as fossil fuels and natural gas.\n\nHowever, the most promising and fastest growing alternative energy is wind power whereby since 5000 BC the wind energy was used to sail boats along river Nile and by 900 AD the Persians had started using it in wind mills to generate power to grind grain and pump water. Professor James Blyth built the first wind mill in Scotland which was used in the production of electric power to light the streets in the year 1887 while in the United States, Daniel Hallady designed the first wind mill which was used to pump water on farms in 1854. The wind mill also facilitated the expansion of railroads through steam driven engines that required water in their operations.\n\nWind power operates in the sense that air flow is used to drive wind turbines to generate power through conversion of kinetic energy into mechanical power by use of various generators. The first wind mill was constructed with four blades and a tail to turn the wind but over time new developments have given rise to multi-blade system comprising of iron and steel which are easily to maintain. Several wind powers usually a hundred of individuals of them make a wind farm and they are used in the production of electric power in the same location. The wind farm is driven by wind turbines through integration of communication network, power collection system and a medium voltage of 3.5 kV. The products of wind power are known to be plentiful, widely accessed and clean without any production of gas emissions. One of the largest wind farm is said to be Gansu Wind Farm which is expected to produce 20, 000 megawatts when fully completed by 2020. Other large onshore wind farms are such as: Muppal wind farm in India, Roscoe Wind farm in United states and Whitelee Wind farm in United Kingdom.\n\nIn the year 2000 and 2006, the capacity and production of wind power quadrupled worldwide and by June 2014, the alternative energy source capacity had expanded rapidly to 336 GW while production of wind energy was estimated to be 4% of total worldwide electric power usage. In order to enhance the capacity growth of wind power and to have its stability, modern and latest variable speed generators are used giving desirable properties for grid interconnection. The specific amount of electric power generated by wind power is obtained by getting a multiplication of nameplate capacity and the capacity factor which will be differentiated with equipment used and the location.\n\nAs the fastest growing alternative energy source, small wind plants have been used by various communities worldwide to pump water for farms and ranches increasing food production while new and more developments on wind energy have given rise to applications in lighting buildings and streets from a central generated power. Other applications of wind energy are such as propelling the sailboats in seas facilitating transportation of materials and people from one place to another. With more technological developments which have given rise to low cost of coming up with a wind plant, wind power is said to be more environmental friendly alternative source of energy in many countries as compared to other forms of renewable energy and non-renewable energy.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T03:16:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2218, "textStart": 2209, "date": "2014-06-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8549019694328308, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369666", "time": "03:16:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375058", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "76", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "104", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "84296", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 5}, {"id": "303165", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Energy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy", "score": 5}, {"id": "303206", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "score": 5}, {"id": "303212", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "score": 5}, {"id": "304169", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "score": 3}, {"id": "304895", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Electric generator"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator", "score": 3}, {"id": "306162", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind", "score": 5}, {"id": "306627", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "score": 3}, {"id": "307847", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Energy development"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development", "score": 4}, {"id": "309831", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "score": 4}, {"id": "309998", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "score": 3}, {"id": "317176", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Windmill"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windmill", "score": 5}, {"id": "321460", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pump"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump", "score": 4}, {"id": "323956", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Electric power"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power", "score": 4}, {"id": "324110", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "score": 5}, {"id": "325301", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nameplate capacity"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nameplate_capacity", "score": 2}, {"id": "330968", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Biomass"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass", "score": 3}, {"id": "345112", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Alternative energy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_energy", "score": 5}, {"id": "347784", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Geothermal electricity"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_electricity", "score": 3}, {"id": "349942", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kinetic energy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy", "score": 3}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "03:16:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Wind Power As The Fastest Growing Alternative Source Of Energy", "originalArticle": null}

Masdar is proud to be supporting the historically close ties between the UAE and the Sultanate by providing our experience and expertise from delivering cutting-edge renewable energy solutions across the world,\" said Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi, Chief Executive Officer of Masdar.\n\nThe company did not disclose the financial details of the 50 megawatt Dhofar Wind Power Project, which will power 16,000 homes and counterbalance 110,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually.\n\n\"The Dhofar Wind Power Project will play an important role in supporting the diversification of Oman's energy mix, while providing a reliable source of clean power to serve its growing population and economy.\"\n\nThe project was established in 2014 between Masdar and the Rural Areas Electricity Company of Oman. Funding is being provided by the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development. GE is leading the engineering, procurement and construction consortium, providing 13 wind turbines.\n\nOman's economy has felt the pinch of a three year oil glut. A halving of crude prices since 2014 left the sultanate with a budget gap of almost 22 percent of economic output in 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund. The country posted a deficit of 2 billion rials ($5.2 billion) in the first five months of the year, compared with 2.5b rials in the year- earlier period.\n\nOman is planning to raise about $2b through debt sales this year as the largest Arab oil producer outside OPEC seeks ways to plug next year's budget deficit, Bloomberg News reported earlier this month, citing people with knowledge of the plans.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance is speaking to banks and is evaluating bond and loan proposals, the news agency cited the people as saying without identifying them. No formal request for a proposal has been made, they said.\n\nMoody's Investors Services recently cut the rating of the sultanate to the second-lowest investment grade, saying Oman's progress toward addressing structural vulnerabilities to a weak oil price environment has been more limited than expected.

As an energy source that uses virtually no water, wind power conserves water for California, and the rest of the U.S.\n\nAfter learning about this, I wanted to take a closer look at wind's history in my home state.\n\nStriking gold\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, thousands of hopeful miners rode to California, looking to try their luck for a pan of gold. Today, standing in some of the same grassy fields as their predecessors, over 3,000 Californian workers spend their days manufacturing, constructing and maintaining wind turbines. These wind workers have struck a valuable resource, one that's far more reliable than gold.\n\nLooking back to wind's roots\n\nCalifornia was the world's original wind power pioneer. According to a study from MIT Press, California embraced commercial wind usage in the 1980s, 10 years before the rest of the world. In fact, utility-scale wind power as we know it was born in the California desert four decades ago.\n\nThanks to this early progress and American innovation, the U.S. had 87 percent of the world's wind power by 1985, and a 60 percent share in 1992 as wind took off as a worldwide industry.\n\nToday, we remain home to some of the world's most productive turbines. For example, a typical 2 megawatt (MW) U.S. turbine powers an average of 510 homes, nearly twice as many as the same turbine in China or Germany.\n\nA window to the Californian wind industry\n\nCalifornia remains a wind leader, with 5,561 MW of installed capacity. That's enough to power 1.3 million homes, and it trails only Texas, Iowa, and Oklahoma.\n\nWind energy has also helped conserve the state's natural resources, since it uses virtually no water. When the 2011-2017 drought was depleting California's water stores, wind power saved the state 3.3 billion gallons of water just in the year 2016 - that's the equivalent of 25.3 billion water bottles.\n\nLooking forward\n\nCalifornia has already begun adding more wind energy to generate clean, low-cost electricity, with 236 MW of wind capacity under construction, and another 182 MW in advanced development.\n\nBecause of this long history, it's no wonder that the Golden State has proved itself as a consistent leader for wind energy.\n\nCheck out this video to see the good things Steve Berberich, the Head of California ISO, has to say about California's renewable future:", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T01:15:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7333333492279053, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369666", "time": "01:15:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375058", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "47", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "56", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "233", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "195392", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "199444", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "227084", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "303000", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "score": 5}, {"id": "303165", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Energy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy", "score": 3}, {"id": "303206", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "score": 5}, {"id": "303828", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Desert"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert", "score": 2}, {"id": "304982", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Drought"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "score": 3}, {"id": "305525", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology", "score": 3}, {"id": "305536", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "score": 1}, {"id": "306162", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind", "score": 5}, {"id": "307847", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Energy development"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development", "score": 3}, {"id": "309317", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Natural resource"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_resource", "score": 2}, {"id": "309676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Turbine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbine", "score": 3}, {"id": "309831", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "score": 3}, {"id": "315542", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "324104", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Megawatt"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt#Megawatt", "score": 3}, {"id": "325301", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nameplate capacity"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nameplate_capacity", "score": 2}, {"id": "407355", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Water security"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_security", "score": 3}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "01:15:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Wind energy helps California power through drought", "originalArticle": null}

For a sustained production of wind energy and extending plant lifespan, turbines and structures need to be placed strategically, exposing blades and towers to harsh weather conditions at sea and land, such as constant winds, UV rays, and precipitation. This may largely cause corrosion and erosion of structures, affecting the efficiency of turbines. With the growing number of wind power generators in several emerging and developed economies, the demand for coatings for wind turbines is rapidly evolving.\n\nThe advent of smart coatings for wind power generation structures and the rise in photo-voltaic applications that have antimicrobial and self-cleaning properties are expected to catalyze the demand for wind power coatings. When applied on turbine blades, smart coatings can detect the amount of damage done by harsh environmental conditions. The market for smart wind power coating is still in the developmental stage and not commercialized. According to the Transparency Market Research (TMR), the rising inclination to lower operating costs among wind power producers is a key factor expected to boost the demand for wind power coatings, globally.\n\nBrowse Market Research Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/wind-power-coating-market.htm ..\n\nWhich are the prominent applications areas of wind power coatings?\n\nThe major applications segments include onshore and offshore. Key onshore applications of wind power coatings can be onshore blades, onshore towers, and onshore interiors. Based on offshore, the market can be segmented into blade, offshore tower, and offshore interior. The application of wind power coatings is expected to gain traction in onshore wind energy plants. This is attributed to the growing prominence of onshore wind projects due to its affordability and the lower cost of generation than in onshore wind power projects and solar PV cells. However, various regional environmental norms may hinder their adoption, thereby negatively impacting the demand for wind power coatings in onshore wind power generating structures.\n\nOn the other hand, the availability of a large area has led wind turbines to be located at sea or in freshwaters, thereby boosting the demand for coatings in offshore wind power.\n\nSubsea Industries, a Belgium-based producer of coating and cleaning systems, has launched an advanced coating system Ecolast in July, 2017 for preventing corrosion and abrasions of wind energy structures. Different from regular coatings in numerous ways, the wind power coating system provides UV resistance and protection while preserving its color. The loss of color of tower of wind turbines, even with the application of extra layers of polyurethane, is a common phenomenon, especially in offshore wind farms. The introduction of Ecolast is expected to overcome such problems. In addition, according to the manufacturer, the coating system protects against salt, tides, or even ice. This is imperative when the turbines are submerged in seawater. The advent of advanced coating systems is expected to bode well for both the segments.\n\nFor more information on this report, fill the form @ goo.gl/o1LXMn\n\nWhich regions are expected to provide lucrative growth avenues for market players in the coming years?\n\nThe major regional markets for wind power coating can be North America, Asia Pacific, Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa. Of these, Asia Pacific and Europe are expected to provide substantial opportunities for producers of wind power coatings. Intensifying governmental initiatives in minimizing greenhouse gas in several countries of the region has fueled the production of wind energy, which is anticipated to boost the regional market. A major demand for wind power coatings is projected to come from China.\n\nMeanwhile, recent advancements in production technologies and the rising adoption of ocean energy and offshore wind energy are the key factors opening up lucrative avenues for market players to capitalize on in the forthcoming years. Rising in imports of wind power coatings from countries such as the U.S., China, and India is further expected to accentuate the Europe market.", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T11:17:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 2519, "textStart": 2509, "date": "2017-07-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7058823704719543, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3369666", "time": "11:17:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3375058", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "303048", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 2}, {"id": "303165", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Energy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy", "score": 5}, {"id": "303206", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "score": 5}, {"id": "303212", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "score": 4}, {"id": "305955", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Photovoltaics"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics", "score": 3}, {"id": "306162", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind", "score": 5}, {"id": "306965", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sea"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea", "score": 4}, {"id": "307261", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Corrosion"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion", "score": 5}, {"id": "309827", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "score": 1}, {"id": "309831", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind turbine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_turbine", "score": 4}, {"id": "309836", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "score": 2}, {"id": "312658", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Polyurethane"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyurethane", "score": 2}, {"id": "317255", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Ultraviolet"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet", "score": 3}, {"id": "324110", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wind farm"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_farm", "score": 5}, {"id": "336292", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "URL shortening"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening", "score": 2}], "image": "http://www.pr-inside.com/images/uploads/pr/2016/81778/20170816_wind-coat_81778.jpg", "timeCrawl": "11:17:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Wind Power Coating: Advent for Smart Coating Systems for Offshore Wind Farms to Bolster Demand", "originalArticle": null}

The facility's capacity alone will be equal to 10% of Australia's current total wind power capacity and looks to be its largest to date.\n\nThe Coopers Gap Wind Farm, slated to be completed in 2019, will be a partnership between GE and Powering Australia Renewables Fund (PARF), which itself is a partnership between AGL Energy Limited and the Queensland Investment Corporation.\n\nThe amount of energy the farm will generate could power approximately 260,000 average Australian homes and cut CO2 emissions by 1.18 million tonnes annually. If this were happening in the states, it would be the equivalent of taking nearly 250,000 passenger vehicles off the road according to Environmental Protection Agency data.\n\nIn the last few years, GE has taken steps to optimize their wind power technology and grow their clean energy business through acquisitions of Alstom SA and LM Wind Power.\n\nThe global capacity for wind power is more than 20 times what it was 15 years ago.\n\nChina leads the world in wind power capacity with 168,690 MW, greater than the entire European Union and more than double the United States. The U.S. had just over 82,183 of wind power last year, the second largest in the world, according to the American Wind Energy Association.\n\nAustralia had 17th greatest installed wind power capacity last year, with 4,327 MW of capacity.\n\nAlthough Australia isn't among the top 10 countries for total wind energy capacity, it is growing its renewable supply at a fast clip. Fifteen percent of its electricity comes from renewable sources -- which beats the U.S. and is fast approaching the share of renewable electricity in China and Germany.\n\nWind energy is the fastest growing renewable source for electricity in the country, according to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Pete McCabe, president and CEO of GE's Renewable Energy's Onshore Wind business, said Australia is GE's second largest region.\n\nThe country has seen immense growth in the sector in 2017.

King at the official launch of the publication which was held at the PCJ Auditorium in New Kingston on Wednesday.\n\nRenewable energy company Wigton Wind-farm Limited launched its first endorsed book, Understanding Wind Energy: Youth Repowering the Future, at the PCJ Auditorium in St Andrew on Wednesday, marking another milestone for the company.\n\nThe book's author, energy engineer Oswald O. King, who has been employed to Wigton for the past nine years, explained his rationale for writing the book.\n\n\"Wigton accommodates school tours at the facility, and each tour that I guided, I noticed that the students asked the same set of questions. This made me realise that there was a gap in the information that is available to them, so I decided to write a book to make information about wind energy and wind-farm operations available to students,\" he stated.\n\nHe further added that his research revealed that there were books readily available about renewable energy, but not tailored towards an in-depth explanation about wind energy and its electricity-generating potential. Consequently, his publication is the first of its kind to be written in Jamaica that is focused solely on wind energy and wind-farm operations.\n\nThe book has been approved by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Information and will be used as teaching material to educate secondary school students in grades seven to nine about wind energy and how it can be harnessed for the generation of electricity. It is anticipated that the book will be published and made available in stores by the end of September.\n\nMinister of Science, Energy and Technology Dr Andrew Wheatley commended the author for his bold undertaking.\n\n\"Commendations to Oswald for writing a book which speaks to our vision as a country and supports the transfer of knowledge that is critical for our nation to move forward. It will give its readers an appetite and appreciation for renewable energy while developing their mindset and approach to innovation,\" he said.\n\nThe Wigton Windfarm operates a 62.7 MW wind generating plant in Rose Hill, Manchester.

Many forums and summits have been conducted to bring universal solution to the harsh changes causing disasters across the world.\n\nCountries are working towards positive and impactful changes for the good of societies and the world as a whole. The seventh and thirteenth Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) discuss affordable and clean energy and climate action that are crucially important for other goals.\n\nThe Eritrean government is committed to sustaining the most and getting a relief by using renewable energy supplies while pursuing its national development agenda. Multiple programs are underway in partnership with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and local organizations so as to answer to the country's growing demand of energy with renewable energies such as solar and wind mills. Windmills are providing alternative energy for rural communities across Eritrea.\n\nGoal number seven of Sustainable Development Goals discuss affordable and clean energy. This means ensuring universal access to affordable electricity by 2030 by investing in clean energy sources such as solar, wind and thermal. Thus, adopting cost-effective standards for a wider range of technologies would also reduce the global electricity consumption by buildings and industry by 14 percent. This means avoiding roughly 1,300 mid-size power plants. Expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean energy in all developing countries is a crucial goal that can both encourage growth and help the environment.\n\nPeople normally rely on traditional forms of energy such as coal, oil or petroleum and for the household use wood is the main source of energy. In the past, around 80% of the energy came from biomass. In addition, the conventional use of electricity results in greenhouse gas emission or CO2 which is hazardous to people's health. However, between 1990 and 2010, the number of people with access to electricity has increased by 1.7 billion, and as the global population continues to rise so will the demand for cheap energy.\n\nThus, the introduction of renewable energies was imminent. In Eritrea it started with solar energy in the year 1995.\n\nIn 2013, 104 solar modules were installed on the roof of the building, producing a total of 15.5 kilowatts of electricity, enough to power the office for eight continuous hours a day.\n\nAccording to director of Renewable Energy Center in the Ministry of Energy and Mining, Mr. Tesfay Ghebrehiwet, the currently addressed renewable energies in Eritrea are the Solar, Wind and Geothermal energy (only pre-feasibility study). Though the installment of solar energy is costly, Mr. Tesfay is confident that it is widely distributed across the country for household and any organizational uses. In 2010, there was only 2% coverage of the solar energy but now the figure has roughly increased into 10%. The reason for the widely use of solar energy, according to the director, is that it is modular, easily installed and applied. This type of energy is not sensitive to topography unlike the wind energy that is highly dependent on the topography of an area. As the temperature in the eastern and western lowlands of Eritrea is higher, the insulation of solar powered energy gets lower but in the highlands the insulation is higher and more reliable. Sometimes in the summer season clouds make it harder for the solar panels to charge and supply power. In these times hybrid energy power generation helps to keep the consistency of the power supply. Geothermal energy can assist the solar energy base load. Solar energy these days is used and applied in communication, agriculture, health institutions and household consumption. In agriculture it is used for refrigerators, incubators, veterinary machines and for storing vegetables and fruits.\n\nEfficient use of renewable energy and quick transformation from biomass and fuel based power generation enabled Eritrea to comply with the clean energy goal. Mr. Tesfay stated that the country is not really a contributor to the global warming but a victim of its consequences. When seen in percentile, its contribution is negligible. On the safe side, using the smokeless stove or Adhanet has an immense impact on preserving trees and thereby protecting the environment from adverse damages. Economy wise, costs are high for oil based power generation. But using renewable sources such as solar and wind boost power efficiency and are future oriented. Introducing efficient renewable energy minimizes the electricity consumption fee per kilowatt. If properly utilized, it makes a big difference on household and organizational saving patterns, and thus economy uplift of the country.\n\nMoreover, using renewable energy reduces biomass energy use and enables people to focus on other investments rather than cutting trees. Further in agriculture, farmers are using solar energy to operate water pumps to fill their reservoirs and water their farms.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy and Mines in partnership with the Solarcentury, provided two solar powered mini-grids to power the communities of Areza and Maidma.\n\nFinanced by the Global Environment Facility and co-financed by the Eritrean government and the UNDP, the Eritrean Wind Energy Application project increased its national capacity to plan, design, install, operate and maintain wind energy systems in the country as part of the Eritrea's contribution to climate change mitigation efforts. Over the last decades Eritrea has made considerable progress in different fronts such as mapping of the Coastal Marine and Island Biodiversity resources and establishing an Integrated Coastal Area Management framework; piloting viability of application of renewable wind energy technologies.\n\nPiloted by the government and the UNDP, there is a wind farm with a capacity of 750 kilowatts in the port city of Assab. Wind energy is applied in the southern Red Sea region in Eritrea. This type of energy, despite its higher logistic costs, provides optimal power energy. The 300 km wind potential area is likely to offer such energy to villages such as Rahayta, Gahro, Berasole, Edi, Beilul and Dekemhare. Places such as Dekemhare and Gizgiza are the wind corridors that feed wind to the other villages. In these villages there are six small stand-alone decentralized wind turbines installed. At present more than 35,000 people have direct access to reliable energy. Wind energy has improved the supply of electricity to water systems, schools, health facilities and small-scale businesses. The project also provides lighting, ventilation, cooling systems, and fish preservation centers, which have improved the livelihoods of small-scale fishermen in the region. Such huge projects brought immediate environmental benefits, as fossil fuel consumption has been reduced. The diesel power plant in the port city of Assab is now saving approximately 680,000 liters of diesel per year, or nearly $730,000 per year in diesel costs.\n\nSmaller villages are also getting fuel savings. They save approximately 16,000 liters of diesel annually, or $17,000. The result is a reduction of CO2 emissions by 1718 metric tons per year with the added benefit of minimizing smoke-related health complications. Despite the positive results wind energy installation requires skilled manpower to operate and continually monitor it. The running cost of wind energy is much higher than that of solar energy as it has moveable partitions.\n\nAside from the immediate economic and social benefits to local communities, the Eritrean Wind Energy Application Project is helping minimize the destruction of forests and reduce carbon emissions.\n\nThe Ministry of Energy and Mines looks for higher penetration of the renewable resources to get the optimal power services to the society and plans to make a 50% power supply using renewable sources of energy. The target is to give optimal service by using available renewable resources efficiently.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T17:41:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.658823549747467, "dateCrawl":

Masdar is proud to be supporting the historically close ties between the UAE and the Sultanate by providing our experience and expertise from delivering cutting-edge renewable energy solutions across the world. The Dhofar Wind Power Project will play an important role in supporting the diversification of Oman's energy mix, while providing a reliable source of clean power to serve its growing population and economy.\"\n\nSaleh Bin Nasser Al Rumhi, chief executive officer of RAECO, said, \"We are pleased to be supporting this project and the construction of the Dhofar Wind Power Project, which will be launched after signing of the project development agreement with Masdar in 2014.\"\n\n\"This project represents a fundamental shift in clean energy projects in the region and in the Sultanate in particular. It is the first project of its kind in the Gulf region and will offset 110,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.\n\n\"The signing of this agreement signifies a major step in the development of the Dhofar Wind Power Project and is testimony to the strong relationship between the Sultanate of Oman and the UAE. We look forward to the signing of other associated agreements related to the project this October,\" he added.\n\nMohammed Saif Al Suwaidi, director general of ADFD said: \"We are proud to fund the Dhofar Wind Power Project, the first of its kind in Oman with its innovative technology and which upon completion will contribute to the Sultanate's position as a clean energy leader in the region and will represent seven per cent of the total installed power generation capacity in the Dhofar governorate, including its capital city Salalah, a major port and free zone.\"\n\n\"Over the past four and a half decades, the Fund has been an instrumental and integral global development aid entity committed to supporting sustainable economic growth around the world,\" he added.\n\n\"This 50 MW project will not only serve as a model of modern power generation but more importantly, demonstrate the commercial viability of wind technology in the Sultanate. In addition, it will help facilitate greater knowledge transfer in renewable energy between the UAE and Oman. Today, this multi-partner initiative is another strategic clean energy endeavour ADFD is pleased to support,\" Al Suwaidi concluded.\n\nGE will lead the EPC consortium, and will provide the project's 13 wind turbines powered by the company's latest 3.8MW wind turbine generator solution. Built upon the technology of its predecessors, the turbine represents the latest development in GE's wind turbine platform, increasing both annual energy production and flexibility in operation. TSK will support the consortium partners with the construction of the balance of plant.\n\nFor Masdar, this is yet another milestone in the field of wind energy after having developed the 117MW Tafila wind farm in Jordan, the Middle East's first utility-scale wind power project. Masdar is also leading new developments in the offshore wind industry through its investment in Hywind Scotland, the world's first commercial-scale floating offshore wind farm and Masdar's latest project in the United Kingdom, in addition to the London Array and Dudgeon offshore wind farms.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T10:25:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.572549045085907, "dateCrawl":

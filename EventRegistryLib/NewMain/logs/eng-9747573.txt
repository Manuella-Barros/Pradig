Or will he be in Toronto for the foreseeable future?\n\nVladimir Guerrero Jr. presents one of the biggest questions of the 2024 MLB trade deadline. With one year of team control remaining after this year, the Toronto Blue Jays can trade high on their star first baseman or sign him to a contract extension. Guerrero was honest over the All-Star Break about the uncertainty of his future.\n\n\"I would love to be in Toronto,\" Guerrero said to MLB.com. \"My family loves Toronto, my kids love Toronto, but at the end of the day, it's a business. We all need to understand that, so whatever happens happens. Definitely, I would like to stay there.\"\n\nThis admission from Guerrero is only half the battle towards getting a contract extension. The Blue Jays would want not only to keep Guerrero long-term but also to keep their core together. If the team wants to begin a rebuild, this would be the time to do it. Guerrero is an unrestricted free agent after the 2025 season and will demand a massive contract extension when the time comes. Between missing out on two-way star Shohei Ohtani in free agency and falling to last place at the All-Star break, the Blue Jays should trade high on their star infielder.\n\nThe case to trade Guerrero\n\nThe Blue Jays are set to sell at this deadline regardless of Guerrero's contract status. Danny Jansen, Yusei Kikuchi, and Kevin Kiermier are just a few names who will hit free agency after the season. With a 9.5-game deficit in the Wild Card race and 14 games back of first in the AL East, those players will almost certainly be on the move. Those players, however, will not command the return that Guerrero would at the trade deadline.\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays have only two prospects in the top 100 of MLB.com's rankings. Guerrero is the type of player that could command an MLB-ready player and a top prospect as a return. Adding multiple top-100 prospects would be key to kickstarting the Blue Jays rebuild. That could only be achieved by trading Guerrero and possibly shortstop Bo Bichette. With this core faltering this season and big money headed both Guerrero's and Bichette's way it would be wise for them to make this deal at the MLB trade deadline.\n\nThe case to keep Guerrero\n\nThe argument for keeping Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has a very simple thesis: star players don't grow on trees. In a hockey-crazed city with a recent NBA champion as well, the Blue Jays are always trying to keep fans' attention in Toronto. Having a power-hitting superstar who has a family baseball history in Canada is a huge seller for the team. Having a player routinely near the top of the jersey sales is extremely valuable for a team.\n\nThe Blue Jays might believe that they can re-sign Guerrero to a $40 million per year contract and draft well to immediately re-stock this core. Keeping him would also keep young fans coming to the ballpark and buying merchandise while they position themselves for another run at the World Series.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_hennessy@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Hennessy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrero", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guerrero"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guerrero"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Danny Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusei_Kikuchi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yusei Kikuchi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Bichette", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bo Bichette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai/Frontons", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai/Frontons", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Jai_Alai", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Jai Alai", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Vladimir-Guerrero-Jr.-gets-brutally-honest-trade-deadline-as-contract-talks-go-nowhere.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747573", "eventUri": "eng-9747573", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

After dominating baseball for most of the past decade, it looked like their dynasty was perhaps coming to an end.\n\nInstead, the Astros did exactly what they had to do leading into the All-Star break and are now just one game out of first place in the American League West. Starting a three-game series against the Seattle Mariners on Friday, Houston even has a chance to take over the top spot in the division.\n\nA major turn of events indeed, and one that shouldn't really come as much of a surprise. Sure, every dynasty has to end at some point, but Houston was never going down without a fight.\n\nAll indications point to them being buyers at the trade deadline, and rumors have suggested that General Manager Dana Brown has been very active. He has a few moves he needs to make due to the injuries they've dealt with on the mound, and the offense could improve, specifically at first base.\n\nOne rumored trade target is Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who Brown has reportedly shown interest in. Guerrero very well might not get moved, as the Toronto Blue Jays have a potential superstar on their hands, but things happen.\n\nIf the Astros were to put together a package that they couldn't refuse, teams would often jump on that. However, that's where the issue for Houston comes into play. Their below-average farm system makes it tough to imagine a scenario where they land a star like Guerrero.\n\nNever say never, and they've shown interest, but it's unlikely.\n\nThe idea of landing him makes perfect sense, so it's possible that Brown does whatever he needs to do to get him on the roster.\n\nGuerrero addressed the trade rumors with Mark Feinsand of MLB.com, acknowledging that he's trying to control what he can control.\n\n\"Like I've mentioned before, I control what I can control,\" Guerrero said through an interpreter. \"I'm just trying to go out there and give my 100 percent and whatever happens after that, I can't control it.\"\n\nHowever, his next comment made it seem like he doesn't want to get traded.\n\n\"I would love to be in Toronto,\" Guerrero said. \"My family loves Toronto, my kids love Toronto, but at the end of the day, it's a business. We all need to understand that, so whatever happens happens. Definitely, I would like to stay there.\"\n\nIt's not a surprise to hear that he doesn't want to get moved, but as he realizes, too, business is business.\n\nSlashing .288/.359/.456 with 14 home runs and 20 doubles, Guerrero would be as perfect of an addition as this team could make over the next few weeks.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farm team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7280,h_4095,x_0,y_292/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_astros/01j31pca4kqfxsnp341z.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747573", "eventUri": "eng-9747573", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Guerrero recently appeared on the \"Developmentally Speaking\" podcast, looking back on her time with WWE and sharing her thoughts on wrestling as the daughter of Eddie and Vickie Guerrero.\n\n\"When I was a kid, just like many of us I'm sure, you think you're the ugly duckling and not good enough,\" Guerrero said. \"And then watching what my dad did, he was just so tough and so beyond great. I never thought I could be good enough to even step foot in the ring.

The self-confidence he gained from being able to protect himself and others.\n\nBut fighting for sport was never in the cards for Guerrero, he said.\n\nUntil it was.\n\nOn Saturday, July 20, Guerrero, who owns Combat Fitness Club in Ridgefield Park, will be fighting against Ariel Perez on the Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry undercard in Miami, FL.\n\nGuerrero's fight is the fourth in the four-round preliminary event expected to being at 7 p.m. The main event features Paul, a 27-year-old YouTuber, against 32-year-old Perry in the main event expected to begin at around midnight.\n\nPaul, now a professional boxer, got his start on Vine in 2013 alongside his older brother, Logan Paul, who became a WWE Superstar and champion in his own right.\n\nJake doesn't exactly have a squeaky clean reputation as he was known for throwing \"raucous\" parties during COVID, and had been accused of sex assault and the use of racial slurs, as reported by Fortune. He was also among several celebrities who agreed to pay the SEC in a crypto settlement.\n\nBut it appears Jake has turned his attention toward fighting, having launched his professional career in 2018 and having since used his platform to give lesser-known fighters a fighting chance.\n\nAmong them, Guerrero.\n\n\"[Jake] is known as an influencer but he's giving opportunities to boxer that haven't had one to come up and get that shine,\" said Guerrero. I'm grateful for that.\"\n\nGuerrero first began training at a gym in North Bergen, after graduating from Wood-Ridge High School. When he wasn't training, he worked a construction job in New York City.\n\nIt wasn't until 2019 that Guerrero decided to open a gym of his own. The timing turned out to have been perfect as he was laid off from his construction job right around the pandemic. He used his severance package to stay afloat and then poured everything he had into Combat Fitness.\n\nOnce he was given the green light to open officially, he leaned into personal training and boxing.\n\n\"Initially I never wanted to compete,\" Guerrero said. \"I was into empowerment.\"\n\nBut Guerrero has an inherent competitive edge and, once he got into sparring, he was curious to find his true potential. Guerrero dabbled in New Jersey Diamond Gloves, the state's amateur circuit before making his professional debut at Biaggios in Paramus in 2023.\n\n\"We had the place packed,\" said Guerrero, who back then was fighting at 165 pounds. \"It ended up in a draw which was controversial. I dropped him in the first round and had him hurt multiple times throughout the fight.\"\n\nAfter that, Guerrero shifted his focus back to Combat Fitness and developing his brand.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Guerrero was approached about the Paul vs. Perry undercard fight. He'd be up against a guy named Ariel Perez who's 3-0, and -- of course -- on a \"mega platform,\" Guerrero said.\n\nAgreeing to the fight was an easy \"yes\" for Guerrero this time, who has spent the past two weeks staying on strict low-carb, high-protein diet. He's been training two or three times a day.\n\nDown from 195 pounds, Guerrero weighed in on Friday, July 19 at 174.4 pounds.\n\n\"I'm expecting a very aggressive, wild type of fighter,\" he said. \"But I believe my skills, my quickness, and my experience is going to be overwhelming for him to find me, and land those big shots that he's looking for.\"\n\nClick here to follow Daily Voice

The decision to buy or sell will be one that could change the outlook of the franchise, for better or worse.\n\nIf the Cubs sell and land prospects that could make an impact one day, it'd be a bonus. If they buy and improve their roster, that'd also be a positive.\n\nWhether they buy or sell, hitting this deadline out of the park is a must. The organization is in a strange spot, and while a trade deadline doesn't always bring ways to fix all of that, Chicago has to make something happen.\n\nThey're only 3.5 games out of the third Wild Card spot, so making the postseason isn't out of the picture. The first half was certainly a disappointment, but if they play well for a week or two, they could find themselves in a position to make the playoffs.\n\nHow they play before the July 30 deadline will ultimately be the reason they do or don't sell. If the Cubs give the front office a reason to buy, they will. If they give them a reason to sell, they can expect that to happen, too.\n\nIn the scenario where they do buy, there are multiple areas they need to improve.\n\nWill they go star hunting or just make moves on the margin? Either could be the right decision, depending on how the remainder of the campaign plays out.\n\nThey've been rumored to have interest in big name talents, including Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Guerrero would give Chicago a star, something they've been searching for throughout the past few seasons.\n\nIt's not a guarantee that he gets dealt, but it's certainly a possibility. The right-handed slugger addressed the trade rumors with Mark Feinsand of MLB.com, saying he's just trying to control what he can control.\n\n\"Like I've mentioned before, I control what I can control,\" Guerrero said through an interpreter. \"I'm just trying to go out there and give my 100 percent and whatever happens after that, I can't control it.\"\n\nGuerrero has made it known that he doesn't want to leave the Toronto Blue Jays, but he's a professional and understands business is business.\n\n\"I would love to be in Toronto,\" Guerrero said. \"My family loves Toronto, my kids love Toronto, but at the end of the day, it's a business. We all need to understand that, so whatever happens happens. Definitely, I would like to stay there.\"\n\nIf he were to get traded, the chances of him being the top player traded at the deadline are very high. The four-time All-Star has the potential to be one of the top hitters in baseball, and would help the Cubs in more ways than not.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe_Life_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Globe Life Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3453,h_1942,x_0,y_161/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_cubs/01j31n73sqa0rq1yr68n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747573", "eventUri": "eng-9747573", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 1135, "textEnd": 1142}, {"amb": false, "date": "2016-07-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Guerrero states that they're both Latinos -- it's proper in Latino culture to greet the elders of your friends -- and Rodriguez should know better.\n\n\"Jeter came over and greeted her and (Rodriguez) didn't do that,\" Guerrero said. \"So I told him, 'You may have a truckload of money, but we both s*** the same.'\"\n\nThe feud between both legends continued soon after.\n\nAnother custom among Dominican players is to send the visitors' clubhouse food. But Rodriguez accused Guerrero of not doing so while the Yankees played the Angels, which Guerrero denies.\n\n\"So, after hitting a double, I asked (Robinson) Cano about the food, and Cano said that Alex doesn't want to eat rice because it's fattening,\" Guerrero said. \"So when I got to third, I said -- never mind, I can't say that because it's a bad word.\"\n\nAsked if he said a bad word to Rodriguez, Guerrero said that he did.\n\n\"I was daring him to come at me so that I can get him back,\" Guerrero said. \"I was ready to hit him. You can't say I didn't send you food when that's not true.\"\n\nAfter his illustrious MLB career, which earned him the honor of entering the Hall of Fame on the second ballot, Guerrero retreated back to the Dominican Republic. That's where, despite earning millions of dollars in his career, he blends in with his community, often seen playing dominoes on the streets, alongside his paisanos.\n\nIt offers a glimpse of the type of person Guerrero is, humble and personable.

Teams have until July 30th at 6:00 p.m. EST to make moves. One team that has become very intriguing to watch is the Houston Astros.\n\nAt one point earlier this season, the Astros looked dead in the water. Injuries were piling up and it looked to be a long shot that they would be able to compete for a spot in the playoffs.\n\nDespite all of the issues they have had to face this season, Houston holds a 50-46 record and are just one game behind the Seattle Mariners in the American League West division.\n\nKeeping that in mind, the Astros have a chance to get better at the trade deadline. There have been rumors and rumblings that they could have interest in pulling off a blockbuster trade.\n\nHeading into the deadline, Houston has two main needs that need to be addressed - first base and starting pitching.\n\nLooking specifically at first base, there have been a couple of major trade targets linked to the Astros. Two of them are Christian Walker and Vladimir Guerrero Jr.\n\nZachary Rotman of FanSided has named Guerrero, specifically, the \"dream target\" for Houston.\n\nGuerrero would certainly be a perfect fit for the Astros. He would give them a much better chance to compete this season, while also being a potential face of the franchise for years to come.\n\nAt the half-way mark of the season, Guerrero has played in 95 games. He has hit .288/.359/.456 to go along with 14 home runs and 55 RBI.\n\nAlong with a trade for Guerrero would come a long-term extension. Houston would have to pay up to keep the star first baseman around for years to come. A new deal and a high trade price tag would be well worth acquiring Guerrero.\n\nIf the Astros were able to acquire Guerrero, they would be getting one of the best bats in baseball. He is also just 25 years old. This is the kind of win now and for the future deal that teams dream of making.\n\nAll of that being said, it will be interesting to see what ends up happening at the deadline. Houston is going to be aggressive in looking to add talent.

Baseball is a crazy sport and has shown time and time again that anything can happen.\n\nIf a team sneaks into the postseason, there's always a pathway to success. With some of the veterans on this roster, especially if the pitching staff is fully healthy, there's a chance the Giants find success in October.\n\nBut for them to do that, they might need to make a few moves at the deadline. They have a few areas they need to improve, specifically at shortstop, center field, and first base.\n\nOne of their dream and rumored targets has been Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who would perfectly fix some of their power issues at first base and the lineup as a whole.\n\nGuerrero could be traded, but the Toronto Blue Jays, despite struggling, could also decide to keep him. While their season is all but over, moving a bright young star in Major League Baseball isn't always the best idea.\n\nInstead, the Blue Jays could retool around Guerrero next year and put a better team around him. From what it sounds like, that's what he wants to happen, too.\n\nThe slugger spoke with Mark Feinsand of MLB.com and continued his strong stance of not wanting to be traded.\n\n\"I would love to be in Toronto,\" Guerrero said. \"My family loves Toronto, my kids love Toronto, but at the end of the day, it's a business. We all need to understand that, so whatever happens happens. Definitely, I would like to stay there.\"\n\nRecognizing that it's a business from Guerrero's perspective is all other teams should need to know. He understands that he could be dealt and sounds like he'll do whatever it takes to win if he does get moved.\n\nHowever, him saying he loves Toronto again could be all their front office needs to know about keeping him around. If that's the case, San Francisco will likely have to find another option if they decide to upgrade at first base.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8192,h_4608,x_0,y_254/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/giants_baseball_insider/01j33exk996bvh8fv0s0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747573", "eventUri": "eng-9747573", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The 29-year-old is owed a total of $44 million across the next three seasons, which is a fair price for another club to take on. His lefty bat would have been an ideal addition for the Yankees' top-heavy lineup, but it's not going to happen this year.\n\nThat being said, Toronto Blue Jays All-Star first baseman/DH Vladimir Guerrero Jr. remains a possibility for the Yankees, as Sanchez noted.\n\nGuerrero Jr. has mentioned in the past that he would not sign with the Yankees due to a past personal issue involving him and his Hall of Fame father Vladimir Guerrero Sr.\n\nHowever, the 25-year-old recently told Virus Deportivo that he is a professional and is willing to play for any team if he is traded. But when asked again about possibly playing for the Yankees this week, Guerrero Jr. made it clear he doesn't want to talk about the Bronx Bombers anymore.\n\n\"I talked to my dad about it and I told him that we decided to close that chapter,\" Guerrero said through an interpreter. \"We don't want to talk about the Yankees situation anymore.\"\n\nGuerrero Jr. would fit nicely with the Yankees, but New York has received strong play from rookie first baseman Ben Rice. So either Rice or DH Giancarlo Stanton, who is nearing a return from the IL, would be displaced. But it's possible that Rice could move back to catcher, which is his natural position.\n\nThe real hurdles are that Guerrero Jr. has another year of control, mixed with playing for an AL East rival, so the price tag ahead of July 30 for the homegrown star would likely be astronomical for the Yankees.\n\nThe Yankees will have to look elsewhere for third base help since McMahon won't be traded. And while Guerrero Jr. remains an option this year, it still looks like an unlikely deal for New York.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Sanchez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Sanchez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globe_Life_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Globe Life Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrero", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guerrero"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guerrero"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Guerrero", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Guerrero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame_and_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giancarlo_Stanton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giancarlo Stanton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3536,h_1989,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_pinstripes/01j2yjz69ym63q8qng2b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747573", "eventUri": "eng-9747573", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 2165, "textEnd": 2172}], "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe name Alex Guerrero meant very little to Birmingham City fans this time last year, but 12 months on and Tom Brady's closest ally is a major player behind-the-scenes in B9.\n\nGuerrero might have spent more time in Birmingham than minority investor Brady and watched Wednesday's friendly with Solihull Moors from the stands. The 59-year-old made his way onto the pitch afterwards, conversing with various members of Blues' backroom staff, before being embraced by Knighthead frontman Tom Wagner.\n\nBut who is he? Brady first started working with alternative medicine man Guerrero in 2005 in a bid to extend his NFL career. With Guerrero by his side, Brady won three Super Bowls, and the NFL icon credits his aide for helping him improve his sporting performance with age.\n\nBrady has publicly dubbed Guerrero his 'body coach' and in 2013 they launched TB12 - a company which uses Brady's profile to pass on Guerrero's methods on performance, recovery and nutrition to other athletes. Blues had two of Brady and Guerrero's coaches, Peter Cummings and Rob Brennan, working with their first team last season. TB12, also known as TBRx, was started after a conversation between Brady and Guerrero in 2012 which, according to their website, went something like: \"If what we're doing works for you, why wouldn't it work for everyone?\"\n\nREAD: Four players look to follow Romelle Donovan's lead and take Blues chance\n\nREAD: Blues training demand pays off as Dembele shows Davies both sides\n\nExplaining how it works, Guerrero said: \"The body coach-client relationship has to be a partnership. That's what I value most about being able to work hand-in-hand with someone - you're both working towards the same goal, and it's so rewarding to watch as that goal is achieved. You truly form a special bond when you accomplish something together.\"\n\nIn an article by the New York Times, Guerrero was referenced as Brady's 'spiritual guide, counsellor, pal, nutrition advisor, trainer, massage therapist and family member'. Many of the beliefs Brady preaches on nutrition and wellness within sport are shared and promoted by Guerrero.\n\nGuerrero stresses the importance of hydration and the use of electrolytes - substances that help the body maintain the balance between fluids inside and outside of cells - to enhance performance. Asked for one piece of advice during a feature interview with the TB12 website, Guerrero said: \"Hydrate! The most important thing you can do. I say it so much that whenever my youngest daughter's friends have any physical complaints, she tells them, 'Drink more water!'\"\n\nDrinking water and using electrolytes are not revolutionary ideas. Part of Guerrero's skill is in the way he advises and improves athletes in the gym.\n\nGuerrero - whose father is Argentine and mother Italian - had an interest in football long before he pitched up at Blues. However, there is a question mark over how his methods, which have been used in the NFL in the main, can be applied to football with athletes of different body types.\n\nHis career and association with Brady hasn't been without its controversies either. Legendary New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick clashed with Brady over Guerrero's influence and made a joke about it during the recent 'Roast of Tom Brady' on Netflix.

Wrestling under the name Raquel Diaz, Guerrero sought to continue her father's legacy in WWE starting in Florida Championship Wrestling and later \"WWE NXT.\" However, in September 2012 she was granted a leave of absence to attend the University of Houston, returning to developmental in 2013 but was finally released in April 2014.\n\n\"I was trying my hardest,\" she recalled during an interview with \"Developmentally Speaking,\" \"I think the values they held with what they wanted from somebody who's female presenting the company, they were not aligned. Those values with my recovery were not aligned, and I needed a longer break so I took a year off.\"\n\nGuerrero said that she thought - at first - that she couldn't return to the company, but after speaking to John Laurinaitis she was brought back to the Performance Center, \"So I packed my bags and I drove from Houston to Florida and we tried again. At that time I was at the WWE Performance Center and I was like, 'This is nice!' like, 'This is different.' Even though that next time still didn't work out like as far as neck injuries, it just wasn't... going. Like, the way I wanted it to go and it wasn't working out. But I happened to meet my husband at the time, and it all worked out in a different way.\"\n\nShe would meet Matthew Rehwoldt - WWE's Aiden English - during her return to the company, and the pair married in 2016. She later described feeling like a failure by not continuing wrestling, cognizant of the fact that some of her family feel the same way, but said she was happy with her current career as a burlesque and fire artist. \"Actually my moniker right before I go out is 'Latina Heat' so it's still a nod to my dad,\" she gleamed.", "source": {"uri": "wrestlinginc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wrestling Inc."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaul_Guerrero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shaul Guerrero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Guerrero", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Guerrero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WWE Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Championship_Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida Championship Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_NXT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WWE NXT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Houston", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Houston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Laurinaitis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Laurinaitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWE_Performance_Center", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WWE Performance Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Rehwoldt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Rehwoldt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hispanic and Latino Americans"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Wrestling/Backyard Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Wrestling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Hand_Games/Thumb_Wrestling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Hand Games/Thumb Wrestling", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.wrestlinginc.com/img/gallery/shaul-guerrero-discusses-attempted-wwe-return/l-intro-1721181842.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747573", "eventUri": "eng-9747573", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-09-", "textStart": 272, "textEnd": 286}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-04-", "textStart": 422, "textEnd": 432}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

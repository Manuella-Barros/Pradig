The train, which took off from the Rigassa station in Kaduna, was said to have derailed at about 8am in Jere, Kaduna State. Security operatives were said to have been immediately deployed in the location to protect apprehensive passengers. A member of staff of the Rigassa railway station, who pleaded anonymity, confirmed the incident, saying three carriages of the train went off the tracks. \u201cBut there was no casualty. Security agents were drafted in the location to provide security cover for the passengers. \u201cThe train was later fixed and the passengers continued with their journey to Abuja. \u201cAs I am talking to you, even the train that left Abuja to Kaduna had since reached its destination,\u201d the rail station staff said. Mansir Hassan, the spokesperson of the Kaduna State Police Command, did not respond to telephone calls when contacted. Train transportation has become very popular among Nigerians following the deadly activities of bandits on the highways, especially along the Abuja-Kaduna highway. Although the highways have become relatively safe in recent times, many people preferred to travel by train because of the terrible condition of the Abuja-Kaduna highway which had been under rehabilitation by the Federal Government for years.", "summary": "John Shiklam in Kaduna Passengers on a Kaduna-Abuja train were said to have been stranded on Sunday morning as the train reportedly derailed an hour after leaving the Kaduna station.", "url": "https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2024/05/26/passengers-stranded-as-kaduna-abuja-train-derails/", "image": "https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/Passengers-Stranded.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:26:40", "author": "John Shiklam", "authors": ["John Shiklam"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ng", "sentiment": -0.324}

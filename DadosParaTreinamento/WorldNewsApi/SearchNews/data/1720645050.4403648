After spending some time together, Vivienne decides to follow Holger to his house. They start a life together and live happily until Holger decides to join the Union Army. Set in the 1860s, The Dead Don\u2019t Hurt places Vivienne at the heart of its story and instead of following the man who goes to war, the movie becomes a striking, moving and gorgeously shot tale of what it meant to be a woman -and to survive as one- in a men-dominated world, where war could appear in many different forms. Viggo Mortensen can do it all: In addition to being a remarkable actor and director, he\u2019s also a seasoned musician and he even composed the score for The Dead Don\u2019t Hurt. The music of a film is a key element in how spectators are going to remember it, but also in how they\u2019re going to live the story. For a filmmaker, it\u2019s also a way to guide the audience and sometimes to create a music that will act as a full character in itself. I asked Mortensen if as a storyteller, he was able to express himself through music in a different way or if he saw it as a way to complete the story: Did he feel like he could express things he couldn\u2019t express on a script? He said, \u201cThe next movie I do, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll do the music. In this case, it was really\u2026 I don\u2019t like when music tells you what to feel and think, it should accompany and it\u2019s a good way to put it, to complete the story.\u201d He added: \u201cIn the case of The Dead Don\u2019t Hurt, it helps for some of the transitions from one time period to another and for the ellipsis and when time moves forward very rapidly, in the middle and second half of the movie especially. I enjoy the collaborative process of doing that with musicians and finding ways to help the movie without underlining anything and in fact, we recorded the music long before we started shooting. So, it was very helpful to guide how long certain scenes would last and what the mood and the ton should be, the rhythm in terms of the dialogue and how much action would be shown.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Godzilla Minus One Dethroned In Netflix s Top 10 List By A New Movie Why Christina Ricci Is Giving Up Ownership Of Wednesday Addams WWE SmackDown Results Winners And Grades On June 7 2024 This piece contains important spoilers past this point Viggo Mortensen in The Dead Don't Hurt Shout Studios The film is dedicated to Grace Gamble Atkinson, who was none other than Viggo Mortensen\u2019s mother, who strongly inspired the character of Vivienne, but also the little girl in the wood we can see right from the beginning. When a medieval knight appears on his horse in front of the girl, fans of The Lord of the Rings will most likely instantly recognize the sword he is carrying. Indeed, it is And\u00faril, Aragorn\u2019s sword in The Lord of the Rings that Viggo Mortensen used for this scene. Keeping his mother close to him throughout this project, as well as a prop he used in the most defining role of his career, it seems like Mortensen used The Dead Don\u2019t Hurt as a tribute to the people and experiences that shaped him and his career. Mortensen said, \u201cIn a way, everything I have learned before starting to shoot the movie, is not just the movies I have seen in my life, hundreds and hundreds of movies and the movies I\u2019ve participated in telling the stories. I\u2019ve been lucky, I\u2019ve learned from very good directors, women and men, different kinds but the best of them, very efficient and good storytellers because they were very well prepared, and because they were good collaborators with their crews. Those are the things I\u2019ve learned. But also, the things that I learned from my mother from the beginning, going to the movies together, talking about movies, I don\u2019t know, you know, anything that I\u2019ve experienced and learned something from, I am sure went through the process of making this movie, even if it wasn\u2019t conscious or I wasn\u2019t thinking of it.\u201d A few years ago, Mortensen got incredibly lucky and met Agn\u00e8s Varda herself on a plane. While talking about Mortensen\u2019s next project, which at the time was his directorial debut, Falling, Varda told him to make sure to not show the audience anything, but rather to make them want to see things. I asked Mortensen how this incredible piece of advice had changed his perspective on filmmaking, and if he felt an influence, a shift in his approach as a film director since then. He said, \u201cIt kind of confirmed what I thought and gave me the confidence to act on it. That\u2019s a really good guide, because a movie, and I think you can see this in The Dead Don\u2019t Hurt, it\u2019s just as important what you don\u2019t show, what the characters don\u2019t say, as what you do show and what they do say.\u201d Vicky Krieps in The Dead Don't Hurt Shout Studios He added: \u201cOf course, you need really good actors to get that across. With Vicky in particular, playing Vivienne, we were really able to do that, because she\u2019s someone that can transmit so much in silence, you almost can feel what her emotions and thoughts are, it feels like it comes through her skin, somehow. She has that gift, she\u2019s not only technically good as an actor, but movies are not fair in that way, some people just have it, that extra thing that on camera, and for the audience, on the screen, you can really relate to them, you can\u2019t take your eyes off them. Whatever they do, you\u2019re interested, you follow them, and she has that. And when she said yes, I knew we had the chance to make a really good western with a strong woman at the center because she has that ability.\u201d The Dead Don\u2019t Hurt is an ode to adventure, love, freedom and independence. In the midst of the Civil War, Holger decides to leave and fight against the Confederacy. Vivienne is both angry and hurt by his decision since she will have to stay behind. However, Holger won\u2019t be the only one joining the battlefield. Vivienne\u2019s own house becomes one, when one night, Weston Jeffries, the dangerous, violent and unpredictable son of an important rancher breaks into her home and rapes her. Holger comes back years after this tragic event. Vivienne gets out of the house, stands on the porch and gauges Holger. Behind her long skirt, a shy little boy is hiding. \u201cHe\u2019s mine\u201d Vivienne tells Holger when he asks whose child it is. Outside of what used to be their home, Vivienne and Holger look at each other like two strangers would. Vivienne abruptly asks \u201cHow was your war?\u201d and Holger replies \u201cHow was yours?\u201d Mortensen said, \u201cA question like \u2018How was your war?\u2019 can be taken in many ways, and to respond with \u2018How was yours?\u2019, he doesn\u2019t even realize what he is saying there, he sorts of instinctively says that. The audience is ahead of him, they\u2019re like \u2018You have no idea\u2019 and I like that. I like when the audience is ahead of the characters. For me, I like movies like that, that respect my intelligence and for me to be able to put things together, because then I feel like I am part of the storytelling, that I am participating. Then by the end of the movie, even though the movie is made by someone I might never even meet, it\u2019s now my movie, it\u2019s my story. I see it in a certain way, I have an understanding that is my own.\u201d The Dead Don't Hurt Shout Studios Silence, in a movie, can be just as powerful as a dialogue. Right after their reunion, Holger and Vivienne are both seated at the kitchen table. The two actors are facing the camera, as the story is being written through their eyes, and ultimately, their smile. They used to be lovers, now they are strangers. They might have to start all over and they might have to learn to live with each other again, but their complicity is soon found again. Viggo Mortensen told me, \u201cBoth scenes are about what they don\u2019t say, and what they want to say. The second scene you\u2019re talking about, at that point, he\u2019s gone off and he\u2019s trying to figure out what he wants to do, in his sort of male way, and he comes back and he knows that it\u2019s really his turn to speak. He has to say something and he is a bit clumsy about it, but at least he makes the effort, and he says something kind of, not stupid, but it\u2019s not like, a great moment in terms of dialogue, but it\u2019s an important moment in his effort, you know,\u201d He added: \u201cIt shows that he actually has an interest, which is why their relationship works. They\u2019re both interested in what the other person thinks and feels, in other words, they are both willing, and this is essential for any relationship to work, friends, lovers, it doesn\u2019t matter, even in a professional relationship. If you show some interest, sincere interest, in what the other person is thinking and feeling, it means you are open to adapting to that person as they change, you\u2019re not closed off to that.\u201d Maelle Beauget-Uhl Following Editorial Standards Print Reprints & Permissions", "summary": "In an exclusive interview, Viggo Mortensen discusses his second directorial movie 'The Dead Don't Hurt', working with Vicky Krieps and meeting Agn\u00e8s Varda.", "url": "https://www.forbes.com/sites/maellebeauget-uhl/2024/06/08/viggo-mortensen-on-the-dead-dont-hurt-we-had-the-chance-to-make-a-really-good-western-with-a-strong-woman-at-the-center/", "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66647ac6fbd3d824cc91c3ac/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:15:06", "author": "Contributor,Maelle Beauget-Uhl", "authors": ["Contributor", "Maelle Beauget-Uhl"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.318}

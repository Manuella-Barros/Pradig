Without a water supply, it is impossible to guarantee essential services to \u201cthousands of people\u201d who travel to the island daily during the tourist season, Mayor Paolo Falco said. \u201cThe health and hygiene situation is explosive, we have taken our countermeasures and activated the crisis unit and issued a restrictive order,\u201d the mayor's order said. The emergency was caused by a failure in the mainland's water system that provides vital supplies to the world-known island. At the moment water is still supplied to most of the island, but some isolated areas of the upper municipality of Anacapri are already dry. Only local reservoirs supply the network, which in the absence of supplies from the mainland risks being run out. Meanwhile, tanks are expected to reach the island to support essential services, pending the restoration of full supply. The Mayor's order was notified shortly after 0900 a.m. causing an immediate stop to ticket sales. The move has created long lines of passengers at the ticket offices at the ports of the southern city of Naples, the departing point for most ferries to Capri. Ferries and hydrofoils that had already departed for Capri were contacted by radio by the maritime authorities, which ordered their return to port and disembarkation of passengers.", "summary": "A water emergency has prompted the mayor of Capri &mdash; one of Italy&rsquo;s most popular islands &mdash; to order a halt to the arrival of tourists, in a crisis that has deprived some areas of any water supply", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/water-emergency-halts-tourist-arrivals-italys-popular-capri-111335809", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:37:33", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.152}

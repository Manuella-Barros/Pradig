ICJ rules Israel must immediately halt its military offensive in Rafah, open the Rafah border crossing The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued a new provisional order in a 13-2 vote that Israel must immediately halt its military offensive and any other action in Rafah and open the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to allow the entry of humanitarian aid to 2.4 million Palestinians who are facing a disastrous situation. Reading out a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) or World Court, the body\u2019s president Nawaf Salam said provisional measures ordered by the court in March did not fully address the situation in Gaza now, and conditions had been met for a new emergency order. \u201cIsrael must immediately halt its military offensive\u201d in Rafah, he said. Death anniversary of poet Amal Dunqul May 21 marks the death anniversary of Egyptian great poet Amal Dunqul who is best known as the \u201cPrince of Refusers\u201d for his famous poem, \u201cDo Not Reconcile,\u201d written in December of 1976, in which expressed his opposition to peace with Israel. Dunqal was born in Qena in 1940. His father was a scholar at Al-Azhar and because of his position in society, he refused to allow Dunqal to play in the streets. This forced him to stay indoors and among books. He spent years memorising poetry by great poets of the old days and started writing poetry himself. His first poem was about Palestine, refusing to write about love when the stories of people dying for Palestine were filling the news. Dunqal married Abla El-Roweini in 1979, and she wrote the biography of him, Al-Janubi (The Southerner), showing how he became a legend. Salah, his wife face wave of criticism Some Muslim fans criticised Mo Salah and his wife after a video circulated on social media, in which Jurgen Klopp hugged Salah\u2019s wife Maggie Salah. The video was filmed after Liverpool\u2019s final game of the season against Wolves in the Premier League was played at Anfield. The match was also Jurgen Klopp\u2019s final game in charge of the club, as he brought an end to a nine-year spell. The video led to some controversy among members of the Muslim community, as they found Maggie Salah\u2019s embrace with Jurgen Klopp inappropriate. They believe that Mohamed Salah should\u2019ve stopped his veiled wife from doing that. Ireland, Spain and Norway recognise Palestinian state Norway, Ireland and Spain took the first step and recognised a Palestinian state in a historic move. Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris told a Wednesday news conference in Dublin: \u201cToday, Ireland, Norway and Spain are announcing that we recognise the state of Palestine. Each of us will now undertake whatever national steps are necessary to give effect to that decision.\u201d Several other European countries have in the past weeks indicated that they plan to recognise a Palestinian state, arguing a two-state solution is essential for lasting peace in the region. \u201cThere is never a wrong time to do the right thing,\u201d Harris later said, speaking to CNN. \u201cIt was my government\u2019s preferred position to recognise a two-state solution as part of a peace process to bring that about, but sadly, unfortunately, such a comprehensive peace settlement now seems, in many ways, further away than it has ever been,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe believe you can\u2019t say you\u2019re in favor of a two-state solution and not recognise the very existence of two states,\u201d he added. Iran\u2019s president died in helicopter crash Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and the country\u2019s foreign minister were found dead Monday hours after their helicopter crashed in fog, leaving the Islamic Republic without two key leaders as extraordinary tensions grip the wider Middle East, according to AFP. Iran has offered no cause for the crash nor suggested sabotage brought down the helicopter, which fell in mountainous terrain in a sudden, intense fog. Hundreds of mourners crowded into downtown Vali-e-Asr square holding posters of Raisi and waving Palestinian flags. Some men clutched prayer beads and were visibly crying. Women wearing black chadors gathered together holding photos of the dead leader. Bella Hadid puts on keffiyeh dress at Cannes Film Festival Unsurprisingly, the Palestinian-origin supermodel Bella Hadid showed her support for her homeland once again; with a video posted on social media featuring her wearing a keffiyeh dress while taking over Cannes. Hadid never stops supporting her homeland although she faces several obstacles due to her support; shamefully, Dior has replaced Hadid with another Israeli model as a brand ambassador. She asserted that she also received killing threats, but she won\u2019t stay silent concerning the outrageous actions occurred in Palestine. It\u2019s worth mentioning that she posted a bold statement on Instagram, starting with \u201c forgive me for my silence\u201d. In her third pinned Instagram post, Hadid shares a photo of someone holding a sign with a quote attributed to her, \u201cIt\u2019s free Palestine til\u2019 Palestine is free,\u201d with an accompanying caption stating, \u201cI will not stop talking about the systematic oppression, pain, and humility that Palestinians face on a regular basis.\u201d", "summary": "<p>By Rowaida Mahmoud &#160; Social media users spoke this week about the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issuing a new provisional order in a 13-2 vote that Israel must immediately halt its military offensive and any other action in Rafah; Norway, Ireland and Spain taking the first step and recognising a Palestinian state in a [&#8230;]</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://egyptian-gazette.com/entertainment/trends-icj-european-recognition-of-palestine-mo-salah-and-his-wife/\">Trends: ICJ; European recognition of  Palestine; Mo Salah and his wife</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://egyptian-gazette.com\">Egyptian Gazette</a>.</p>", "url": "https://egyptian-gazette.com/entertainment/trends-icj-european-recognition-of-palestine-mo-salah-and-his-wife/", "image": "https://egyptian-gazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/images-28.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:58:32", "author": "Gazette Staff", "authors": ["Gazette Staff"], "language": "en", "source_country": "eg", "sentiment": 0.144}

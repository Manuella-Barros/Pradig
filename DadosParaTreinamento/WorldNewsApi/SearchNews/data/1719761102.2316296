{"id": 225050180, "title": "Dark Web Identity Thief Claims He Orchestrated Scheme to Sell Graceland", "text": "A dark web scammer has taken credit for trying to sell Elvis Presley\u2019s Graceland home, The New York Times reports. The paper said it received two emails from a person who claimed to be the brains behind this scheme and other identity theft frauds. \u201cWe figure out how to steal. That\u2019s what we do,\u201d the scammer said, adding that he and his dark web network of \u201cworms\u201d often targeted elderly and unsuspecting people, often in California and Florida, using publicly available documents like birth certificates to procure crucial personal information. Still, he acknowledged the Graceland grift had fallen short: \u201cI had fun figuring this one out and it didn\u2019t succeed very well.\u201d The Times said it received the messages after reaching out to an email address listed in court documents for Naussany Investments & Private Lending LLC, the company that tried to sell Graceland at auction earlier this month. The writer said he was based in Nigeria, and his emails were written in Luganda. A translator who looked at the documents noted that the use of the Bantu language was sporadically clunky compared to the fluent English used in Naussany\u2019s court filings. The grift began when Naussany claimed that Elvis\u2019 late daughter, Lisa Marie Presley, had put up the deed to the mansion as collateral for a $3.8 million loan. Naussany tried to settle that debt last year, aiming to collect $2.85 million from the Presley family trust, now overseen by Lisa Marie\u2019s daughter, Riley Keough. Keough, however, was skeptical of the demand, prompting Naussany to give notice of the auction. Keough then successfully sued to stop the sale, claiming that her mother\u2019s signatures had been forged and that Naussany was \u201ca false entity created for the purpose of defrauding\u201d the Presley trust. Nobody representing Naussany appeared at the court hearings last week, but there was a last-minute filing brought by a person claiming to be Gregory E. Naussany, asking for more time to prepare a defense (it included the comically long email address gregoryenaussanyniplflorida@hotmail.com for further contact). Not long after, though, The Associated Press received a statement (sent by a Naussany-connected email listed in court docs) saying it would not go forward with the case. In his emails to The Times, the scammer appeared to give credit to Keough, saying: \u201cYo client dont have nothing to worries, win fir her\u2026 She beat me at my own game.\u201d Last week, after the Graceland auction was halted, the Tennessee attorney general, Jonathan Skrmetti, said he was opening an investigation into Naussany. In response to the emails sent to The Times, the AG\u2019s office said it was aware of the letters and said it would \u201ccontinue looking into the matter.\u201d", "summary": "<em>The New York Times </em>said it received emails from the purported leader of a fraud ring, who said, \"I had fun figuring this one out and it didn\u2019t succeed very well\"", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/graceland-auction-sale-scam-dark-web-identity-thief-credit-1235029287/", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2153563632.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:11:03", "author": "Jon Blistein", "authors": ["Jon Blistein"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.411}

He was allegedly caught red-handed by a CBI team from the Lajpat Nagar area around 11.30pm on Wednesday.\n\nED has also registered a case against Singh under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and has taken action to place him under \"immediate suspension\" and repatriate him to his parent department, the financial crimes probe agency said in a statement. It also carried out joint raids with the CBI on Thursday in the matter at Singh's office.\n\nAccording to the CBI's first information report (FIR), which names Singh and \"unknown others\", based on the complaint of Vipul Harish Thakkar (the jeweller from Mumbai), verification done by the sleuths revealed that a \"criminal conspiracy was hatched by Sandeep Singh with others to obtain undue advantage from the complainant of \u20b920 lakh... for not arresting his son Nihar Thakkar in the matter being investigated by ED\".\n\nSharing details of the probe, ED said in its statement that it is conducting a money laundering probe against certain entities based on multiple FIRs of Delhi, Uttarakhand and Bengaluru Police.\n\n\"In this case, search action was conducted and completed on August 4. During this action, Sandeep Singh, Assistant Director, ED acting as the 'search warrant authorized officer' had searched the residential premises in Mumbai of an individual under investigation,\" ED statement added.\n\nVipul Thakkar, ED added, is the owner of M/s VS Gold, an entity that was suspected to be part of money laundering.\n\n\"The search was uneventful and conducted according to the due procedure. Singh is not the investigating officer of this case. He was requisitioned for the limited purpose of searching the target premises. However, he represented himself as an investigating officer and allegedly accepted the bribe for favouring the accused though he was in no way connected with the case being investigated,\" ED added.\n\nThe agency also said it took immediate cognisance of this incident and following the policy of zero tolerance towards corruption, it has \"initiated criminal action against Singh under the PMLA\".\n\n\"His office was jointly searched on Thursday by CBI and ED to collect evidence related to the offence. In addition to the PMLA case, action has also been initiated to place him under immediate suspension and for his repatriation to his parent department from ED,\" it added.\n\nThere have been several instances of corrupt activities by ED officers, who are dealing with sensitive money laundering and foreign exchange cases, in the last year.\n\nIn August last year, an assistant director - Pawan Khatri - and an upper division clerk, Nitesh Kohar, of ED were arrested by CBI for allegedly taking \u20b95 crore bribe from a businessman - Amandeep Dhall - so the latter was protected from the arrest in the Delhi excise policy probe.\n\nAn ED officer, Ankit Tiwari, was arrested by the Tamil Nadu Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC) in December last year for allegedly accepting a payment of \u20b920 lakh to away an investigation against a government employee. DVAC even searched ED's office in Madurai. ED had approached the Supreme Court alleging that DVAC was using the case to conduct a roving inquiry by conducting search and seizure in the ED office in a bid to recover material related to sensitive cases being probed against sitting ministers in the state.\n\nIn another case, Rajasthan Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) in November 2023 arrested Naval Kishore Meena, an Enforcement Officer (EO) in ED, for allegedly accepting \u20b915 lakh bribe for not attaching an individual's property in a chit fund case.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The investigation agency moved forward with the arrest after a trap was laid to catch the accused red-handed with the help of the jeweller.\n\nNotably, in Aug 2023, the CBI arrested an Assistant Director of ED along with six other officials for accepting bribes of \u20b95 crore to save Delhi businessman Aman Dhall in the Delhi liquor scam case.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandeep_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sandeep Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadav", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yadav"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taxation in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prima facie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/08/1600x900/The-Enforcement-Directorate--ED--on-Friday-seized-_1720810502015_1723126013723.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800727", "eventUri": "eng-9800727", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "dateEnd": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 88, "textEnd": 102}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The assistant director-level officer, identified as Sandeep Singh, was allegedly caught red-handed while accepting a \u20b920 lakh bribe from a Mumbai-based jeweler whom he was threatening to implicate in a false case. Sandeep Singh, currently posted at the ED Headquarters in Delhi's Investigation Unit-1, was trapped by the CBI's Anti-Corruption Unit, Mumbai, in New Delhi, along with the \u20b920 lakh in cash that he had allegedly extorted from the jeweler in exchange for favors in an ongoing ED investigation.\n\nFollowing his arrest by the CBI, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has taken immediate cognizance of the incident and, adhering to its zero-tolerance policy towards corruption, has initiated criminal action against Sandeep Singh. An ECIR case has been registered against him under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (PMLA). In addition to the PMLA case, action has also been initiated to place him under immediate suspension and for his repatriation to his parent department from the ED, which is the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), the officials said.\n\nAccording to officials. Sandeep Singh, who previously worked with the CBDT, was appointed as Assistant Director in the ED in May of last year.\n\nOn Thursday, a joint team from the CBI and ED conducted searches at Singh's office and residential premises to collect evidence. According to an official statement from the ED, this action followed the FIR and the subsequent arrest of Sandeep Singh by the CBI.\n\nSources revealed that Sandeep Singh was caught in a trap set by the Mumbai CBI Anti-Corruption Bureau in Delhi's Lajpat Nagar market. Following an ED raid in Mumbai, Singh allegedly attempted to extort bribes from the jeweler by threatening to implicate his son in the case. Based on the complaint, the CBI Anti-Corruption Bureau registered an FIR on August 7th, leading to the setup of the trap in New Delhi and Singh's subsequent arrest.\n\nThe CBI ACB received a complaint on August 6th from Wadala-based jeweler Vipul Harish Thakkar against Shri Sandeep Singh, Assistant Director, ED HQ, Investigation Unit-1, New Delhi. According to officials, the verification conducted by investigators revealed that a criminal conspiracy was allegedly hatched by Sandeep Singh with unknown accomplices to obtain an undue advantage of \u20b920 lakh from the complainant. This was purportedly in exchange for not arresting his son, Nihar Thakkar, in the matter being investigated by the ED.\n\nDuring the investigation into the circumstances leading to Sandeep Singh's arrest, it was found that the ED was conducting a money laundering investigation against certain entities based on multiple FIRs registered by the Delhi, Uttarakhand, and Bangalore police. A search operation was carried out and completed on August 4th, during which Sandeep Singh acted as the 'Search Warrant Authorized Officer' and conducted a search at the Mumbai residence of Vipul Thakkar, the owner of M/s V S Gold, a company suspected of involvement in money laundering. The search was uneventful and conducted according to due procedure.\n\nED officials clarified that Sandeep Singh was not the investigating officer in this ECIR; he was only assigned to conduct the search at the specified premises. However, Singh allegedly misrepresented himself as the investigating officer and accepted a bribe in exchange for favoring the accused, despite not being directly connected to the ongoing investigation.\n\nCurrently, Sandeep Singh is in the custody of the CBI ACB Mumbai. The agency would seek his transit remand after which he would be brought to Mumbai on Friday and will be produced before the special CBI court where his remand would be sought.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taxation in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandeep_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sandeep Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prevention_of_Money_Laundering_Act,_2002", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttarakhand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uttarakhand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttarakhand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2023-03/5219b5c2-4972-47ce-ae96-d6771e195fbf/Untitled_design___2023_03_03T114857_432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9800727", "eventUri": "eng-9800727", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1984, "textEnd": 1994}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 2110, "textEnd": 2120}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 2925, "textEnd": 2935}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

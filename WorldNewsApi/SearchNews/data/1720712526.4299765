His underdog story has brought him from a jail cell to center stage at Nissan Stadium, headlining CMA Fest\u2019s Saturday night show. The crowd was already cheering before the hometown hero took the stage, and he rewarded their applause by performing \u201cThe Lost.\u201d Pausing to take in the triumphant, full-circle moment, Jelly Roll \u2014 and many in the audience \u2014 were soon in tears. But those tears didn\u2019t last long before turning into a joyous celebration. \u201cI am from Nashville, Tennessee!\u201d he shouted to the crowd, which roared back with equal enthusiasm. \u201cMy father brought me here 23 years ago when the Tennessee Titans first came to town \u2014 this is a dream come true\u2026 playing to a sold-out Nissan Stadium crowd\u2026 and I\u2019m getting to perform the No. 1 on country radio right this moment,\u201d he said, before launching into his current (and fourth) Billboard Country Airplay No. 1, \u201cHalfway to Hell.\u201d The performance was heightened by Keith Urban playing guitar during the performance. One year ago, he got a taste of headlining at the stadium when he performed on the platform stage at CMA Fest, but on Saturday night, he fully made that dream come true. He dedicated his set to the teens that are currently in the juvenile center. \u201cI know they can hear us because I was one of them, one time. I was in and out of jail and in and out of drug addiction, and tonight I am headlining CMA Fest at Nissan Stadium,\u201d he said. Launching into \u201cSon of a Sinner,\u201d with lights aglow all around the stadium, he said, \u201cI\u2019m here to tell you you can do whatever you want in life, I don\u2019t give a f\u2014 what anybody says,\u201d before praising country music as \u201cthe genre that saved my life.\u201d Jelly Roll\u2019s shows have become part concert, part therapy session, part spiritual revival for those who identify as an outcast, feel misunderstood, are struggling with addiction, or are simply working through any personal struggles \u2014 and his CMA Fest set was no exception. \u201cThis is a come one, come all kind of crew,\u2019 he said. He later added, \u201cI am here to represent the lost and the broken,\u201d before performing his new song \u201cI Am Not Ok.\u201d Prior to making country music, Jelly Roll was primarily known as a rapper, and he passionately and effortlessly sailed through a medley of rap classics, including Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself,\u201d Biz Markie\u2019s \u201cJust a Friend\u201d and Outkast\u2019s \u201cMs. Jackson,\u201d before performing his own collaboration \u201cWild Ones\u201d (sans Jessie Murph). The crowd\u2019s reaction was so fervent that the singer-songwriter collapsed onto a riser on the stage, laughing in amazement. Later on, wife Bunnie XO made a brief appearance and shared a kiss with Jelly Roll. From there, he offered up his four-week No. 1 Country Airplay hit \u201cNeed a Favor,\u201d with the audience waving hands high in the air. He then followed up with his two-week No. 1 \u201cSave Me,\u201d welcoming labelmate Lainey Wilson back to the festival stage with a hug. Jelly Roll then returned solo to center stage, waving his hat to the crowd and thanking the audience for their part in his triumph story.", "summary": "Jelly Roll has a triumphant hometown moment, plus Keith Urban and Lainey Wilson offer top-shelf sets.", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/lists/cma-fest-2024-saturday-nashville-top-moments-recap/", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jelly-roll-cma-fest-june-8-2024-billboard-1548.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:11:05", "author": "Jessica Nicholson", "authors": ["Jessica Nicholson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.315}

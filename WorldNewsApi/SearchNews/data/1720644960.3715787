Prabakaran said that he was inspired to launch the \u2018unite AIADMK\u2019 mission after a message posted on X stressing on the need for unity received positive responses from cadre.The three leaders said that it was distressing to see the 55-year-old party that had been the number one in the State coming down the third position in the elections in some constituencies. To be told that the electoral fight for supremacy in the State would be between the DMK and BJP was unacceptable to them, they said, adding that it should be only between the AIADMK and DMK. Asked about the unity moves, Palaniswami blamed Pannerselvam for the splintering of the AIADMK and said that he had certain dreams that did not materialize and hence was trying to unite the party now. He ruled out a future alliance with the BJP and blamed State leaders of the BJP like K Annamalai for the party\u2019s debacle in the elections. His party did not win any seats because the people of the State would vote differently in the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls, he said, adding in the next Assembly elections the AIADMK would triumph.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/southern-states/tamil-nadu/bjp-says-only-it-can-beat-dmk-aiadmk-begs-to-differ-898008", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/08/1095766-bjp.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:34:47", "author": "D Sekar,G Babu Jayakumar", "authors": ["D Sekar", "G Babu Jayakumar"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.606}

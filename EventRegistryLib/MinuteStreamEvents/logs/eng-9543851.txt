That he truly can become the third straight franchise quarterback for the Packers, dating back to Brett Favre. And that raises the very real question of whether he should have held firm a year ago, forcing the Packers to either pick up his fifth-year option or let him enter a contract year.\n\nThere's another side to this. If Love hadn't done a deal that gave him a two-year commitment from the Packers, they wouldn't have picked up his fifth-year option (per source). Also, the Packers were 2-5 after seven games.\n\nWhen G.M. Brian Gutekunst was asked if it will take more than the balance of the 2023 season to determine whether Love will be the starter moving forward, Gutekunst put Love on notice. \"I hope not,\" Gutekunst said at the time. \"I think we've got 10 games left. It's gonna be a very important 10 games.\"\n\nWithout the contract Love had gotten, would he have even gotten those 10 games? Would they have given someone else a chance to show what he can do? Would they have begun actively planning for life after Love?\n\nEven if the Packers quietly began considering their options for 2024, the contract allowed Love (we're told) to stay focused on the task at hand. The security was critical to Love's turnaround -- which propelled the Packers to the divisional round.\n\nThey went 7-3 down the stretch, they blew out the Cowboys in a wild-card game, and they could have (should have) beaten the 49ers in the divisional round. It could have (should have) been Packers at Lions for a berth in the Super Bowl. It could have (won't say should have) been Packers-Chiefs in the Super Bowl, in the first year after Aaron Rodgers left town.\n\nIn hindsight, the key stretch (prior to the playoff win) was the three games after a loss at Pittsburgh that dropped Green Bay to 3-6. Win at the Chargers, win vs. the Chiefs, win at Detroit on Thanksgiving. Turn those three around, and the Packers are 3-9 with a fork in the season -- and possibly also Love's Green Bay career.\n\nHere's the point. Without the security that came from the two-year deal, Love might not have been able to shut out the noise and turn it around. The season could have spiraled out of control, and he would have been looking for his second chance on the open market.\n\nInstead, he's now clearly the guy in Green Bay. And he'll get paid this year. It's not a matter of if but when. Especially since there's no owner in Green Bay who needs to cram the coffers with cash to buy a superyacht.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Favre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brett Favre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Gutekunst", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Gutekunst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thanksgiving (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vFvCci8Fe4j9mEe3YowSTA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/0aa8500b5ed1f1f80c0866a4b9df4b1b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543851", "eventUri": "eng-9543851", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

At this moment, it was his hefty contract that made him stick with the Green Bay Packers instead of looking elsewhere, as per the NFL analyst Mike Florio.\n\nLove was drafted by the Packers in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft. However, the QB had to play the backup for Aaron Rodgers for three years. He did not get a shot until Rodgers moved to the New York Jets. However, this move troubled the Packers and Love.\n\nAfter Rodgers' departure, the Packers signed a special two-year contract extension with Jordan Love. This extension covered his fifth-year optional rookie contract as well, worth up to $22.5 million.\n\nBefore the extension, Jordan Love and the Packers struggled with an abysmal 2-5 record. Mike Florio of 'Pro Football Talk' suggests, it is at this juncture that the safety of a two-year contract helped Love focus. He writes:\n\n\"Here's the point. Without the security that came from the two-year deal, Love might not have been able to shut out the noise and turn it around.\"\n\n\"The season could have spiraled out of control, and he would have been looking for his second chance on the open market.\"\n\nThe Packers remained committed to Love, and with a sense of security about his future, he found his groove and solidified his position as the team's top QB.\n\nJordan Love's new contract will come soon\n\nLove's phenomenal performances helped the Packers make a deep playoff run last season. The expectation is that Love will sign a mammoth deal with the Packers sooner rather than later. As per ESPN's Jeremey Fowler, this is a deal both parties are looking forward to. He said:\n\n\"The sense is around the league is that Green Bay is motivated to do a deal, to do an extension with Jordan Love.\"\n\nWith the QB market getting expensive with each passing day, a player possessing the caliber of Love is expected tomake an entry into the top 10 of the highest-paid QBs in the league, as per reports.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "utkarsh_tiwari@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Utkarsh Tiwari", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Florio", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Florio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Poetry", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Poetry", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long_Distance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long Distance", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/86f92-17149256267804-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543851", "eventUri": "eng-9543851", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The storied franchise has a legendary history at the position, especially in recent years. They went directly from Brett Favre to Aaron Rodgers, two of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, and followed them up with Love.\n\nNot only did Love exceed most expectations in his first year as a starter, but he did something that Rodgers was unable to do in the year prior. Rodgers' final season included missing out on the NFL Playoffs, while Love made it and advanced to the second round. He entered a difficult situation to begin his career and seemingly passed his first test.\n\nHost of the Locked on Packers podcast Peter Bukowski recently highlighted Love's accomplishments last year in comparison to Rodgers in 2022 via his X account. He quoted a post from Ian Haritz outlining PFF's supporting cast rankings for the past five years and pointed out that Rodgers' was better than Love's.\n\nBukowski said:\n\n\"Jordan Love producing significantly better with a supporting cast worse than Aaron Rodgers had in 2022 relative to his peers. Makes you think.\"\n\nPFF's analysis determined that the Green Bay Packers' supporting offensive cast was worse in 2023 than it had been in the previous four seasons. Bukowski was pointing out that it's interesting that Love was able to do more with less than Rodgers had in his final season in Green Bay.\n\nAaron Rodgers' final game with the Packers was a loss against the Detroit Lions that eliminated them from appearing in the NFL Playoffs. Jordan Love did make it to the postseason and became the first-ever seventh-seeded team to win a playoff game when the Packers defeated the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nWhen exploring their passing statistics in those two seasons, Love outperformed Rodgers there as well. While it's still extremely early, it seems as though the iconic Packers quarterback position is in good hands going forward.\n\nComparing Jordan Love's first year with Packers to Aaron Rodgers' final season in Green Bay\n\nAaron Rodgers won the NFL MVP award consecutively in 2020 and 2021 with the Green Bay Packers. They represented two of the best seasons of his entire career, but 2022 was a much different story. His numbers significantly regressed, resulting in his fewest yards since 2017 and most interceptions since 2008.\n\nThe legendary quarterback's final passing numbers for the 2022 NFL season included 3,695 yards with 26 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. Jordan Love then took over in 2023 and posted better statistics than that immediately. Despite being a full-time starter for the first time ever, he turned in an impressive 4,159 yards with 32 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_hulse@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Adam Hulse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Love", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Favre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brett Favre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long_Distance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long Distance", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/fec3a-17150163897585-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543851", "eventUri": "eng-9543851", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Try restock, reload and continue chasing greatness.\n\nGreen Bay traded away future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron Rodgers in April, 2023, then fielded the NFL's youngest roster a year ago. Most believed the Packers would take a step back.\n\nInstead, Green Bay reached the playoffs, upset Dallas in the Wild Card round and had eventual NFC champion San Francisco on the ropes before fading in the divisional playoffs.\n\nNow, everyone inside the organization understands things will be different in 2024.\n\n\"One of the things I re-iterated to our guys is just understand, the expectations going into (2023) are not going to be the same going into next season,\" Packers coach Matt LaFleur said. \"And they've earned that, but with that you better put in the work because nothing's guaranteed.\"\n\nWhat does that mean for 2024?\n\nWell, here's a few predictions -- and three bets that could win you some money.\n\nLove was arguably the MVP of the league in the second half of 2023.\n\nLove, Green Bay's first-year starter at quarterback, was also the biggest key to the Packers' growth last season. Love struggled early and Green Bay was just 2-5 in November. Love was one of the NFL's elite quarterbacks in the second half of the season, though, when the Packers went 7-3 and rallied to make the postseason.\n\nLove made all 19 starts, threw 37 touchdown passes and just 13 interceptions. During a two-month window between Week 11 and Green Bay's NFC divisional playoff game at San Francisco, Love had a stretch where he threw a remarkable 23 touchdowns and just one interception.\n\nLove's passer rating eclipsed 108.0 in eight of his final 10 games, and in four of those his rating was at least 125.0. He had four games with three touchdown passes and no interceptions.\n\nIf Love plays anywhere near that level again, he'll be in the MVP race.\n\nKansas City's Patrick Mahomes begins the year as the favorite at +650. Houston's C.J. Stroud is second at +700, while Love and Cincinnati's Joe Burrow have the third-best odds at +1200.\n\nAs outlined above, the Packers -- who went 9-8 last season -- are a team on the rise.\n\nThe NFL youngest group in 2023 finished the year red hot, and should be poised for bigger and better in 2024.\n\nGreen Bay faces seven playoff teams from a year ago, but four of those will be home games and a fifth is a neutral site contest against Philadelphia in Brazil.\n\nThe Packers will also be extremely motivated following their season-ending loss to San Francisco in the NFC Divisional playoffs.\n\nGreen Bay upgraded the roster in free agency and had a productive draft. The Packers seem well positioned to win more games than a year ago.\n\n\"I think (Super Bowl) always has been (the expectation). I don't think it ever left,\" Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said. \"You know, with 5 minutes to go in that (San Francisco) game, I think we were squarely thinking that's where we were headed. So, I don't think that'll ever change here. I mean, that's really the only goal. We're not interested in much else.\"\n\nDefending division champion Detroit is the favorite here at +160. Chicago is at +275 and Minnesota is +750.\n\nDetroit's reward for winning its first divisional title in 30 years is a much tougher schedule that includes eight games against teams made the playoffs in 2023. The Lions also face the first-place teams from the NFC East, NFC South and AFC East.\n\nAfter years of mediocrity, the NFC North seems like one of the strongest divisions in football. Green Bay and Detroit are legitimate Super Bowl contenders, and Chicago seems poised to make a major jump.\n\nSo the race for divisional title will be intense all season.\n\nWith Green Bay on the rise, though, and the Lions facing a tougher road than they're accustomed to, don't be surprised to see the Packers win this division.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

That option would've guaranteed Love about $20 million for the 2024 season before he ever took the field as Green Bay's full-time starter in 2023. Instead, Love signed a short-term extension that guaranteed him $13 million, according to Spotrac.\n\nFriday is May 3, 2024, when one of last season's breakout stars can sign a new deal. The Brink's truck stayed in the warehouse last year. This time around, it'll be parked right outside Lambeau Field for the player the Packers hope is their quarterback for the next decade-plus.\n\n\"We want to do it the right way and certainly, the sooner, the better,\" general manager Brian Gutekunst said of Love's new deal at the annual league meeting in late March. \"But at the same time, we want to make sure we do it the right way. We've started (negotiations), but it's not something that's going to go quickly. It'll take some time.\"\n\nGutekunst said in February that he \"absolutely\" expected running back Aaron Jones back for the final year of his contract, but Jones is now a Viking after declining to take the approximately 50-percent pay cut that Green Bay wanted him to. In other words, Gutekunst has said he wants to extend Love, but nothing is final until the ink is on the paper (the deal will happen, maybe just not this weekend).\n\nWhat might that new contract look like and where might Love rank among quarterbacks' average annual salaries once he signs it? As it stands, Love ranks 20th in that department at $13.5 million. The top five are Cincinnati's Joe Burrow ($55 million), the Chargers' Justin Herbert ($52.5 million), Baltimore's Lamar Jackson ($52 million), Philadelphia's Jalen Hurts ($51 million) and Pittsburgh's Russell Wilson because of his Broncos contract (about $48.5 million).\n\nBased on last season's play and future potential alone, you can argue that Love deserves to be in the top five. And if Love's ascension continues, such a deal could look like a bargain for the Packers in a couple of years.\n\nBefore Love signs, Spotrac founder Michael Ginnitti helps us sift through the numbers of hypothetical extensions with an estimate of what Love's new deal will look like.\n\nGinnitti: If we're projecting Love's next contract in Green Bay simply by the numbers, our math says we should be looking at a four-year extension including $144 million of new money ($36 million per year). How did we get here? The four most comparable variable contracts include the Seahawks' Geno Smith ($25 million per year), the Giants' Daniel Jones ($40 million per year), the Chargers' Justin Herbert ($52.5 million per year) and the Bengals' Joe Burrow ($55 million per year). Statistically speaking, this provides us a near perfectly balanced percentage change when factoring in a variety of passing/rushing statistics.\n\nBut is it realistic to assume that Love will be operating on a contract worth $20 million per year less than the top quarterbacks in football? No.\n\nFirst off, the league salary cap increase (plus-13.6 percent) should have agents resetting their own expectations (as seen with recent wide receiver extensions across the league).\n\nSecondly, Love has already agreed to and half played out a \"bridge deal.\" If the contract being offered this time around doesn't reflect upper-echelon quarterback pay, Love and his representation are arguably better served to play out the 2024 season under his current contract ($11 million cash) with a high-priced franchise tag or free agency on the table thereafter.\n\nSchneidman: You don't mess around with someone you think can be your franchise quarterback. The Packers wouldn't pay wide receiver Davante Adams what he wanted when he wanted it before eventually trading him to the Raiders, but they've since replaced him with four wideouts in Christian Watson, Romeo Doubs, Jayden Reed and Dontayvion Wicks who make up one of the best young wideout corps in the league.\n\nThis is not to say any of them are anywhere close to Adams' level or ever will be, but finding a quarterback who can sniff what Love appears to be capable of would be more difficult. The Packers won't want to risk Love and agent David Mulugheta deciding to play out his contract year with no long-term security. Even though the Packers could franchise tag Love and retain his rights for another year, the far more simple and amicable resolution is to sign him to a contract extension this offseason.\n\nAnd if you think a top-five average annual value contract for half a season worthy of such a payday is extravagant, that's simply the price of doing business in the NFL. Sometimes, as with the Giants and Jones, such a gamble doesn't pay off. The Packers hope the one they're about to take does, and maybe even it looks like a bargain in short order.\n\nGinnitti: If we attempt to adjust our outcome based on logic and reason, it seems best to begin by stating that Jones' $81 million, two-year guarantee should become an absolute floor for any young quarterback looking to step into his next contract. Jones scored that $40.5 million average guarantee against a $224.8 million league salary cap, or an 18-percent allocation. If we adjust that up to the current $255.4 million league cap, we're now approaching a $46 million per year average annual guarantee.\n\nNow, if we assume that Love is on track to be a better quarterback than Jones in the coming years, the numbers need to be adjusted north even more. If we bring Herbert into the equation (a player our math says Love compares to quite favorably), we're now dealing with a $133 million guarantee over three years, against a $224.8 million salary cap, or a 19.8-percent allocation. Adjusted forward for 2024, and the average guarantee now becomes $50.5 million, which also just so happens to be the total value average salary across Herbert's seven-year contract.\n\nIn this regard, it's not hard to envision a four-year, $200 million extension for Love (five years, $211 million total value, including $151.5 million practically guaranteed over the next three or three and a half seasons). Of course, this kind of guarantee structure would involve Green Bay shifting away from its rigid \"no base salary guarantee\" policy, but with most other teams going this route for their blockbuster quarterback contract, the Packers are likely next to follow suit.\n\nSchneidman: While Love sitting behind Aaron Rodgers for three seasons certainly had its perks, this is one of the drawbacks, if you even want to call it that. The Packers only have one season of Love starting to base their decision on when it comes to paying him big money. If Love had started for, say, two or three seasons before it came time to pay up, they'd have a much bigger sample when trying to project what's to come.\n\nThis payday may come with a couple more butterflies in Gutekunst's stomach because it's really based on only the second half of last season since Love's first half was mediocre at best. Then again, the Packers rolled the dice on drafting him with three years left on Rodgers' contract and moving on from Rodgers to start Love when they did, so who's to say this roll of the dice to potentially pay a guy with such little track record more than $50 million per year won't pay off, too?", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors":

Jimmy Graham, who played for the Packers in 2018-19, was also part of the Derby crew as was one of Bakhtiari's brothers, Eric.\n\nOn Sunday, Rodgers shared a picture on social media of the 10-person group while wearing their Derby best.\n\n\"The Crew 2024,\" he wrote on Instagram with the photo.\n\nRodgers has organized a gathering with his friends to the Kentucky Derby for years, dating back to their time on the Packers.\n\nBut now as their careers have taken them elsewhere -- some like Hawk and Flynn are retired -- the trip serves as somewhat of a mini Packers reunion.\n\nThe group of former Packers also walked the red carpet for another big event last weekend ahead of the Kentucky Derby: the 35th annual Barnstable Brown Derby Eve Gala on Friday.\n\nAnd while they weren't in Rodgers' Derby photo on Instagram, Allen Lazard and Randall Cobb, two former Packers wide receivers who joined Rodgers on the New York Jets last season, as well as former Green Bay offensive linemen Bryan Bulaga and Corey Linsley were on the guest list for that gala as well.\n\nThe invite-only event is held at the $1.2 million Bonnycastle home of Patricia Barnstable Brown in Louisville, Kentucky. It's an event that brings out a who's who of celebrities in the music industry, entertainment and professional sports circles.\n\nAccording to the Courier Journal, the former Packers players received cheers as they got out of their vehicles for the gala.\n\nAfter the Kentucky Derby, the preparations continue for the 2024 NFL season for some of those players.\n\nRodgers, who spent the first 19 years of his Hall of Fame career in Green Bay before being traded last offseason to the Jets, is looking for redemption after missing all but the first four plays of the 2023 season due to a torn Achilles.\n\nLazard is in Year 2 of his four-year contract with the Jets. He's hoping the return of Rodgers gives him a boost after a disappointing season. The 33-year-old Cobb is a free agent after an unproductive year in New York.\n\nBakhtiari is a free agent as well after the Packers released him in March. He continues to recover from major knee injuries.\n\nAdams, still among the best wide receivers in the NFL, is in his third season with the Las Vegas Raiders. He spent the first eight years of his career in Green Bay.\n\nGraham, 37, is a free agent after spending last season with the New Orleans Saints. He was out of football in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type":

The team took Arizona offensive tackle Jordan Morgan in Round 1 to replace David Bakhtiari and Texas A&M linebacker Edgerrin Cooper to take over for De'Vondre Campbell.\n\nWhile the Packers' draft was a success overall, here are three agents the franchise should target to continue building its roster for the 2024 season.\n\nAdoree Jackson (CB), New York Giants\n\nGreen Bay was wise to address a defense that ranked 29th in pass efficiency defense. Following the losses of Darnell Savage, Jonathan Owens, and Rudy Ford (combined 30 starts in 2023) in free agency, the team added Georgia safety Javon Bullard in Round 2, Oregon safety Evan Williams in the fourth round, and Kitan Oladipo of Oregon State in the fifth. The Packers also signed free agent safety Xavier McKinney, an up-and-coming star for the New York Giants.\n\nBut surprisingly, the Packers waited until their final pick in the seventh round to select a cornerback -- Kalen King of Penn State. After trading away Rasul Douglas mid-season, the franchise needed a solid #2 starter opposite Jaire Alexander. Keisean Nixon, and Carrington Valentine are far from dependable, with both falling in the \"Below Average\" category in Pro Football Focus' player grades. The team also released corner Eric Stokes post-draft.\n\nThe Packers could still add a veteran corner in free agency, and former New York Giant Adoree Jackson would be a smart signing. Jackson is coming off a tough 2023 season in which he allowed 58 receptions for 752 yards but was an above-average player in 2022 and 2021 according to PFF. The veteran made it clear that he wants to win a Super Bowl, and joining the Packers gives him a great shot at that dream.\n\nAhkello Witherspoon (CB), Los Angeles Rams\n\nAdoree Jackson should be Green Bay's first target at the cornerback position. But the Packers would be wise to also pursue Ahkello Witherspoon -- either as a backup plan if they whiff on Jackson or as a veteran nickel corner alongside Jackson. Witherspoon tied for the Los Angeles Rams' lead with three interceptions in 2023 and he only allowed a passer rating of 75.7 when targeted. Two years prior, Witherspoon allowed a passer rating of just 35.1 with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nWhile Witherspoon does carry some injury concerns (missed 21 games across 2021 and 2022), he is a solid nickel cornerback who will be an immediate upgrade to the Green Bay secondary.\n\nGreg Van Roten (OG), Las Vegas Raiders; Chris Hubbard (OT), Tennessee Titans\n\nIt still remains to be seen if First Round draft pick Jordan Morgan will slot in at guard or tackle for the Packers. If Morgan takes over at left tackle, Green Bay needs to find a new starter at right guard. In this scenario, the team should look to add a guard like Greg Van Roten -- who started all 17 games for the Las Vegas Raiders in 2023.\n\nIf the Arizona draftee enters the lineup at right guard, the Green and Gold lack a decent backup tackle. Veteran tackle Chris Hubbard, who played on great offensive lines in Pittsburgh and Cleveland, is a dependable player who can play all across the offensive line. While the addition of Day 3 draft picks Travis Glover and Jacob Monk provide good o-line depth for the future, Green Bay still needs a proven offensive lineman who can play immediately. Glover and Hubbard fit this profile.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_hanley@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Liam Hanley",

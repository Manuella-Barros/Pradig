Bickerstaff says there's proof he can turn around Pistons after doing it with Cavaliers | TSN", "body": "DETROIT (AP) -- J.B. Bickerstaff believes he can be the coach to finally turn around the Detroit Pistons, a once-proud franchise that has had the NBA's worst record the last two seasons.\n\nThe Pistons, who have lost a league-record 14 straight playoff games dating to 2008, hired Bickerstaff after he was fired by the Cleveland Cavaliers, a franchise the coach helped improve over four seasons.\n\nBickerstaff took over the Cavs in 2020, when John Beilein exited with a 14-40 record. He led them to the playoffs in each of the last two years, winning a first-round series last season.\n\n\"I think the proof is there that we have the experience,\" Bickerstaff said Wednesday when he was formally introduced as Detroit's third coach in three years.\n\nThe Pistons were drawn to the 45-year-old Bickerstaff because he previously led three NBA teams, giving him a track record to help sell his vision to a mix of young players and veterans.\n\n\"You want somebody who can come in here and hit the ground running, and who's done this before,\" Pistons president of basketball operations Trajan Langdon said. \"Especially with a young team coming off a difficult season, positivity was important.\n\n\"We felt experience was important. The players needed to feel like the person coming in here knew what he was talking about.\"\n\nBickerstaff, who twice finished among the top five in NBA Coach of the Year voting, was 170-159 in four-plus seasons in Cleveland and had six victories in the playoffs.\n\nThe Cavs fired Bickerstaff in May after winning 99 regular-season games over the last two seasons and losing to Boston in the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nDetroit gave him a four-year contract, with a team option for a fifth season. He is replacing Monty Williams, who was fired one season into his six-year, $78.5 million contract.\n\nLangdon is succeeding fired general manager Troy Weaver, whose teams in Detroit won 23% of its games in his four seasons.\n\nWhile Langdon has made many moves to potentially make the team better on the court, his decision to give Bickerstaff another shot on the sideline was a recruiting process that Bickerstaff said he appreciates.\n\nHis previous head coaching positions were all promotions -- in Houston, Memphis and Cleveland after Kevin McHale and David Fizdale were fired and Beilein resigned.\n\n\"All of us are human -- feels good to be wanted and sought after,\" Bickerstaff said. \"The fact that Trajan reached out and gave me the call, let me know that he believed in me right away.\"\n\nDetroit will have to overcome doubts to be a winner next season.\n\nCade Cunningham's improved surrounding cast, though, seems to set the team up for some level of improvement.\n\nCunningham, who agreed to a $224 million, five-year contract extension to stay in the Motor City, should have some more shooters to help spread the floor.\n\n\"There's some high-level, high-ceiling potential guys,\" Bickerstaff said. \"It's our responsibility to help them get there.\"", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Saturday's trade with the New Orleans Pelicans added four veterans to the roster, plus two future first-round draft picks, for Murray.\n\nThat leaves the Hawks with an overstocked roster and the possibility that more veterans could leave Atlanta.\n\nFields said Wednesday that the decision to trade Murray, who joined Trae Young in Atlanta's high-scoring backcourt the last two seasons, followed the conclusion that \"we wanted to reshape some things.\"\n\n\"It was hard decisions, challenging,\" Fields said. \"We knew that where we ultimately want to be was going to require some challenging decisions. ... So from now until the start of the season, we'll have some more tough decisions to make.\"\n\nThe Hawks have not won a playoff series since advancing to the 2021 Eastern Conference finals and they finished 10th in the Eastern Conference at 36-46 this season.\n\nThe first step in reshaping the roster was Fields trading AJ Griffin to Houston and acquiring the rights to guard/forward Nikola Djurisic of Serbia in the draft.\n\nForward E.J. Liddell, a 2022 second-round draft pick who was part of the package of veterans acquired from the Pelicans, said Risacher \"has got a lot of potential to be really great. He's a tough shot-maker. He's tall. It's going to be really tough to contest his shots. And he can handle the ball for a guy so tall.\"\n\nLiddell, who also will play on the Hawks' Summer League team, guard Dyson Daniels, forward/center Larry Nance Jr. and center Cody Zeller were acquired in Saturday's trade. Daniels was a 2022 first-round pick.\n\nThe trade created a surplus of options at center. There has been speculation the Hawks could trade Clint Capela, who has shared time with Onyeka Okongwu. Fields said he was trying to reach an agreement with center Bruno Fernando to push back Wednesday's deadline to guarantee Fernando's $2.72 million salary for next season.\n\nBickerstaff confident he can turn around Pistons\n\nDETROIT -- J.B. Bickerstaff believes he can be the coach to finally turn around the Detroit Pistons, a once-proud franchise that has had the NBA's worst record the last two seasons.\n\nThe Pistons, who have lost a league-record 14 straight playoff games dating to 2008, hired Bickerstaff after he was fired by the Cleveland Cavaliers, a franchise the coach helped improve over four seasons.\n\nBickerstaff took over the Cavs in 2020, when John Beilein exited with a 14-40 record.

Bickerstaff in Year 1 with Pistons? 'Improvement'", "body": "Detroit -- J.B. Bickerstaff was in a similar position as Monty Williams' was a year ago.\n\nBickerstaff was fired from the Cleveland Cavaliers after five seasons and a second-round playoff exit. He considered taking a year off of coaching before jumping back into the grind.\n\nBut then Trajan Langdon rang.\n\nIn just a few hours after that fateful call, Bickerstaff found himself in a car on his way to Detroit. It didn't take long for Langdon to identify Bickerstaff as being the \"right coach and right leader\" for the job.\n\n\"His passion and desire to be here in Detroit and be the next leader\" was evident, Langdon said.\n\nEven before Bickerstaff put pen to paper on his four-year guaranteed contract with a fifth-year team option, Langdon put his new head coach to work.\n\nThere's a lot to do in a short period of time. Bickerstaff hit the free agent recruiting trail with Langdon and met with Tobias Harris in San Diego earlier this month. Bickerstaff has also had to figure out his staff and meet with the players.\n\nA deep dive into the Pistons' previous roster showed a pool of what Bickerstaff called \"high-level, high-ceiling potential guys,\" with Cade Cunningham at the center of it all.\n\nNow, Bickerstaff will have to develop those young players while also finding ways to win.\n\nWhat does success look like in Year 1 for Bickerstaff?\n\n\"Improvement,\" he said. \"Development sometimes can only impact individuals. We aim to make the development lead to impact winning.\"\n\nHe doesn't want to set a timeline or throw out a number of wins he wants to reach. Instead, he wants to see growth in the way the team does things. He wants the Pistons to play selfless basketball, to be competitive night in and night out and make the winning plays that lead to success. He's hoping that the addition of veterans Harris, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Malik Beasley will help the youngsters learn what it takes to make it in the league.\n\n\"There's not a timeline because every situation is different,\" Bickerstaff said. \"Our aim is to get better as the season gets on. Stylistically, though, you'll be able to see what we're trying to do.\"", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan_Langdon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trajan Langdon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobias Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cade_Cunningham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cade Cunningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hardaway Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Beasley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malik Beasley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Recruiting", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/10/PDTN/74354988007-20240710-ctjsp-pistons-033.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2799,1575,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722576", "eventUri": "eng-9722576", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Saturday's trade with the New Orleans Pelicans added four veterans to the roster, plus two future first-round draft picks, for Murray.\n\nThat leaves the Hawks with an overstocked roster and the possibility that more veterans could leave Atlanta.\n\nFields said Wednesday that the decision to trade Murray, who joined Trae Young in Atlanta's high-scoring backcourt the last two seasons, followed the conclusion that \"we wanted to reshape some things.\"\n\n\"It was hard decisions, challenging,\" Fields said. \"We knew that where we ultimately want to be was going to require some challenging decisions. ... So from now until the start of the season, we'll have some more tough decisions to make.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Liddell, a 2022 second-round draft pick who was part of the package of veterans acquired from the Pelicans, said Risacher \"has got a lot of potential to be really great. He's a tough shot-maker. He's tall. It's going to be really tough to contest his shots. And he can handle the ball for a guy so tall.\"\n\nLiddell, who also will play on the Hawks' Summer League team, guard Dyson Daniels, forward/center Larry Nance Jr. and center Cody Zeller were acquired in Saturday's trade. Daniels was a 2022 first-round pick.\n\nThe trade created a surplus of options at center. There has been speculation the Hawks could trade Clint Capela, who has shared time with Onyeka Okongwu. Fields said he was trying to reach an agreement with center Bruno Fernando to push back Wednesday's deadline to guarantee Fernando's $2.72 million salary for next season.\n\nBickerstaff confident he can turn around Pistons\n\nDETROIT -- J.B. Bickerstaff believes he can be the coach to finally turn around the Detroit Pistons, a once-proud franchise that has had the NBA's worst record the last two seasons.\n\nThe Pistons, who have lost a league-record 14 straight playoff games dating to 2008, hired Bickerstaff after he was fired by the Cleveland Cavaliers, a franchise the coach helped improve over four seasons.\n\nBickerstaff took over the Cavs in 2020, when John Beilein exited with a 14-40 record. He led them to the playoffs in each of the last two years, winning a first-round series last season.\n\n\"I think the proof is there that we have the experience,\" Bickerstaff said Wednesday when he was formally introduced as Detroit's third coach in three years.\n\nThe Pistons were drawn to the 45-year-old Bickerstaff because he previously led three NBA teams, giving him a track record to help sell his vision to a mix of young players and veterans.\n\n\"You want somebody who can come in here and hit the ground running, and who's done this before,\" Pistons president of basketball operations Trajan Langdon said. \"Especially with a young team coming off a difficult season, positivity was important.\n\n\"We felt experience was important. The players needed to feel like the person coming in here knew what he was talking about.\"\n\nBickerstaff, who twice finished among the top five in NBA Coach of the Year voting, was 170-159 in four-plus seasons in Cleveland and had six victories in the playoffs.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pantagraph.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landry_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landry Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomington,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bloomington, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trae Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dejounte_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dejounte Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_Daniels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dyson Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._J._Liddell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E.

He is replacing Monty Williams, who was fired one season into his six-year, $78.5 million contract.\n\nLangdon is succeeding fired general manager Troy Weaver, whose teams in Detroit won 23% of its games in his four seasons.\n\nWhile Langdon has made many moves to potentially make the team better on the court, his decision to give Bickerstaff another shot on the sideline was a recruiting process that Bickerstaff said he appreciates.\n\nHis previous head coaching positions were all promotions - in Houston, Memphis and Cleveland after Kevin McHale and David Fizdale were fired and Beilein resigned.\n\n\"All of us are human - feels good to be wanted and sought after,\" Bickerstaff said. \"The fact that Trajan reached out and gave me the call, let me know that he believed in me right away.\"\n\nDetroit will have to overcome doubts to be a winner next season.\n\nCade Cunningham's improved surrounding cast, though, seems to set the team up for some level of improvement.\n\nCunningham, who agreed to a $224 million, five-year contract extension to stay in the Motor City, should have some more shooters to help spread the floor.\n\nLangdon's early moves include signing Tobias Harris and Malik Beasley, acquiring Tim Hardaway Jr. from Dallas in a trade and selecting Ron Holland of the G League Ignite with the No. 5 pick in the NBA draft.\n\nThe veterans will be asked to produce while leading a group of young players that includes 20-year-old Jalen Duren, 21-year-old Ausar Thompson along with 22-year-olds Cunningham and Jaden Ivey.\n\n\"There's some high-level, high-ceiling potential guys,\" Bickerstaff said. \"It's our responsibility to help them get there.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "larry_lage@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Larry Lage", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Bickerstaff", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

He led them to the playoffs in each of the last two years, winning a first-round series last season.\n\n\"I think the proof is there that we have the experience,\" Bickerstaff said Wednesday when he was formally introduced as Detroit's third coach in three years.\n\nThe Pistons were drawn to the 45-year-old Bickerstaff because he previously led three NBA teams, giving him a track record to help sell his vision to a mix of young players and veterans.\n\n\"You want somebody who can come in here and hit the ground running, and who's done this before,\" Pistons president of basketball operations Trajan Langdon said. \"Especially with a young team coming off a difficult season, positivity was important.\n\n\"We felt experience was important. The players needed to feel like the person coming in here knew what he was talking about.\"\n\nBickerstaff, who twice finished among the top five in NBA Coach of the Year voting, was 170-159 in four-plus seasons in Cleveland and had six victories in the playoffs.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "wcfcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wcfcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landry_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landry Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Waterloo, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Waterloo, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Deere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trae Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dejounte_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dejounte Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_Daniels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dyson Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._J._Liddell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E.

Bickerstaff's introductory press conference with Detroit Pistons", "body": "It's been an introduction-filled summer for the Detroit Pistons, who have held separate press conferences for their new president of basketball operations, Trajan Langdon, and fifth-overall pick Ron Holland, within the last three weeks.\n\nOn Wednesday, they introduced their new head coach, J.B. Bickerstaff. Langdon sat at the podium next to Bickerstaff, who the team officially hired last week, at their practice facility in New Center. Here's the biggest takeaways.\n\nSEE THE NEWEST PISTONS: Detroit Pistons announce Las Vegas Summer League roster, with top draft pick Ron Holland\n\nAfter he was dismissed as head coach from the Cleveland Cavaliers in May, Bickerstaff initially discussed taking a year off with his family. That was before, roughly a week before the draft, Langdon reached out around 11 p.m and asked if he could interview for the Pistons' vacant position.\n\nBickerstaff had a trip planned in two days, so he drove to Detroit the next day to meet with the Pistons' front office. He checked multiple boxes the Pistons wanted, as he had previously coached a Cavaliers team initially led by a trio of young players in Darius Garland, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen before trading for Donovan Mitchell in 2022.\n\nLangdon saw a leader with great communication skills and an energy and willingness to build a program. The Pistons interviewed two candidates who would've been first-time head coaches in Dallas Mavericks assistant Sean Sweeney and Minnesota Timberwolves assistant Micah Nori. Ultimately, Bickerstaff's experience pushed him over the top. Langdon didn't officially take over as president until the beginning of June, and having a coach who understands the process was important.\n\n\"You want someone who can come in here and hit the ground running, and has done this before,\" Langdon said. \"Especially with a young team coming off of a difficult season, positivity was important. When we started digging into the different coaches we were looking at, we felt that experience was important. That the players needed to feel like the person coming in here knew what he was talking about.\n\n\"I'm not saying that the other people didn't, but it's important to have that experience of leading a group, understanding the ability to communicate and connect with the players and a lot of times it's hard to do that as a leader if you've never done it before. We felt really, really confident with J.B. coming that he'd be able to do that with our group.\"\n\nAfter meeting with Pistons brass -- including vice chairman Arn Tellem and owner Tom Gores -- Bickerstaff said he walked away convinced that he had a chance to be a part of something special.\n\n\"I thought this group as a whole had a great vision,\" he said. \"Tom has given every resource to go out and execute that vision. I was extremely excited about that. And obviously you study the team. I took a deep dive as quickly as I could. Obviously the experience of planning against them four times for so many years. But I knew the players well and I believed in their ability, I believed in their talent. There is a steps process that we have to take and we're really aware of that, and Trajan and I are united in that and aligned in that.\"\n\nThe Pistons clearly have big expectations for their former first-overall pick, who recently agreed to a maximum extension worth $224 million. The 22-year-old guard, who averaged 22.7 points, 7.5 assists and 4.3 rebounds per game in his third season last year, remains the focal point of the rebuild and has the tools to be elite on both ends of the floor, Bickerstaff said.\n\n\"I think he's a stud,\" Bickerstaff said. \"I don't think there's a lot he can't do on the basketball floor with his size, his ability to see the floor, his ability to create shots. Defensively with his length and size there's so many things we can do with him. Our focus is making him one of the best two-way players in the league. In having conversations with him, he's hungry. Obviously last year was difficult for everybody, himself included. He has a fire, he's a competitor and he wants to be a part of what takes the Pistons to the next level.\n\nMUST WATCH: Make \"The Pistons Pulse\" your go-to Detroit Pistons podcast, available anywhere you listen to podcasts (Apple, Spotify) or watch live/on demand on YouTube. ]\n\n\"The excitement that he brought, that helps raise my energy level and you'll see as the season goes by we'll just keep picking each other up. There won't be tough times for anybody because somebody's always going to be there to pick him up. He's shown that leadership and that will, and throw his talent on top of it and you've got a guy who's capable of being really special.\"\n\nBickerstaff had an All-Star duo in Mitchell and Garland -- two lead guards best with the ball in their hands. They led the Cavaliers to back-to-back playoff appearances, and Bickerstaff had to find ways to make sure both players were being played to their strengths.\n\nCunningham and Jaden Ivey haven't reached that tier of success yet, but they project as the Pistons' future backcourt. Bickerstaff will take what he's learned in Cleveland with him to Detroit as he figures out how to help Cunningham and Ivey thrive together.\n\n\"Any time you get the opportunity to be fortunate enough to work with elite basketball players, you have to take something and learn from them,\" he said. \"Finding different ways to use them together, finding different ways to rotate them so they get the opportunity to play to their strengths. We always tried to keep one of those guys on the floor. We allow them to close games together, to start games together, but you build your rotation so that you always have one of those dynamic players on the floor.\n\n\"I want to take first hand notes and get two of those guys together before I make any decisions or any declarations to you guys about how we'll use them and what we'll do with them. But believing in their talent and their skillset, there's going to be plenty of ways that we can use them so that they'll be difficult for opponents to match with.\"\n\nBickerstaff added that he wants to explore ways to get the ball to Ivey while he's already on the move, and intends to sit down with him to learn what he wants to accomplish next season.\n\n\"There's just a natural speed and athleticism that's hard to deal with in this league,\" Bickerstaff said. \"The way the rules are set up, the way teams are spacing the floor, the tempo that people want to play with, he's going to be extremely difficult to guard. One of the things that he has the ability to do is just put a ton of foul pressure on people. We know in this league, guys don't want to pick up fouls. That's going to allow him to get to the paint more, be able to create either layups for himself, kick-out 3s. To play modern NBA basketball, his tempo and his speed gives you an advantage to do that. \"\n\nBefore he officially signed his contract with the Pistons, Bickerstaff was already recruiting on behalf of the team. On July 1, he and Langdon flew to San Diego to meet with free agent Tobias Harris, who the team would agree to a two-year, $52 million contract with later that same day. Bickerstaff wasn't officially announced as head coach until July 3.\n\nIt speaks not only to how eager he was to get started, but the importance of having players like Harris on the roster. The Pistons prioritized adding spacing this offseason, and both of their new free agency acquisitions -- Harris and Malik Beasley -- along with their trade for Tim Hardaway Jr., added players with established track records as 3-point shooters.\n\n(SHOOTING) HELP WANTED: With Malik Beasley signing, Detroit Pistons finally ready to join the modern NBA\n\n\"You want to surround your guys that you're developing with people who make them better,\" Bickerstaff said. \"With the young guys that we have, we're trying our best to put them in positions of success, and success, on offense in particular, often starts with that space.\"\n\nThe Pistons also needed more experience, as they will have six players still on rookie contracts next season.\n\n\"All the research that we've done and that Trajan and his crew have done on these guys' professionalism from a day-to-day -- how do they eat, how do they get in the weight room, their recovery -- all these small things that veteran players who have had a ton of success and have played a ton of games, like Tobias has played a lot of games, right? How do we get that and help that translate to our young guys? Because it is true, they respect their peers and their veteran players. They have a ton of respect for those guys, and they're doing the work behind the scenes that we're not alway a part of.\"\n\nContact Omari Sankofa II at osankofa@freepress.com.

Bickerstaff.\n\n\"It's something I'm excited to be a part of,\" Bickerstaff told Local 4. \"You don't get these opportunities often to be a part of something that's building from the ground up.\"\n\nBickerstaff brings experience to Detroit. Including interim roles, this will be his fourth head coaching opportunity in the NBA. That attribute is something that drew the Pistons to his leadership.\n\n\"There are a lot of different characteristics that we looked at in the new coach that we wanted to hire, and that was probably about 15 things,\" Pistons President Trajan Langdon said. \"Experience definitely is one of them. You want somebody to come in and hit the ground running.\"\n\nBickerstaff's last team in Cleveland built itself on a defensive mentality, and that's the plan here in Detroit. The Cavaliers finished seventh in scoring defense last year, while holding opponents to 46.3% shooting (sixth in the NBA).\n\nSelling this young roster on that aspect of the game is Bickerstaff's priority.\n\n\"It's just a matter if you want to win or not,\" Bickerstaff said of teams with a defensive mindset.\n\n\"Offense is what it is. They don't put stops in the paper, they put buckets in the paper. You look at the teams with the most success that played the longest this year, those teams were really good defensively.\"\n\nLike Langdon mentioned in his introductory press conference, Bickerstaff did not put a timeline on getting this team back to their winning ways after a 14-win season.\n\nInstead, he wants to see a gradual progression from a young team surrounded by veteran additions in the offseason.\n\n\"Every situation is different, our aim is to get better as the season goes on,\" Bickerstaff said. \"Wins and losses are something that come on their own timeline.\"\n\nBottom line: The Pistons hired a guy who genuinely seems to want to be here. Bickerstaff did not have to jump back into head coaching after being let go in Cleveland, but here he is, ready to lead this team into the future with a brand of basketball that Detroit can be proud of once again.\n\n\"It's not going to be easy, but nothing good ever comes easy,\" Bickerstaff said. \"You want to be around people who are willing to go through the grind and all of the ugly stuff, so at the end of the day, you can enjoy the success that's come from it.\"", "source": {"uri": "clickondetroit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WDIV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan_Langdon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trajan Langdon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/graham-media-group/image/upload/f_auto/q_auto/c_thumb,w_700/v1/media/anyclip/HAkZnpABSmtk9tfoLthq/1720639616467_1920x1080_thumbnail.jpg?_a=ATAPphC0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722576", "eventUri": "eng-9722576", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

For the third time in his coaching career, Lowe will return to Detroit, following Bickerstaff after he was hired last week.\n\nThe Pistons initially planned to have Monty Williams run the team following the Dwane Casey era. Last summer, Williams inked a six-year deal with the Pistons. After one season, the Pistons decided to cut ties with Williams, leading them to another coaching search.\n\nDetroit considered several candidates, with Bickerstaff being on their radar from the beginning. While his time with the Cavaliers ended in disappointing fashion, losing in the second round of the playoffs, the Pistons believe Bickerstaff is the right guy to help turn the team around.\n\nLowe joins the staff as a seasoned assistant, and former head coach.

Now what?\n\nThe Hawks have not won a playoff series since advancing to the 2021 Eastern Conference finals and they finished 10th in the Eastern Conference at 36-46 this season.\n\nThe first step in reshaping the roster was Fields trading AJ Griffin to Houston and acquiring the rights to guard/forward Nikola Djurisic of Serbia in the draft.\n\nForward E.J. Liddell, a 2022 second-round draft pick who was part of the package of veterans acquired from the Pelicans, said Risacher \"has got a lot of potential to be really great. He's a tough shot-maker. He's tall. It's going to be really tough to contest his shots. And he can handle the ball for a guy so tall.\"\n\nLiddell, who also will play on the Hawks' Summer League team, guard Dyson Daniels, forward/center Larry Nance Jr. and center Cody Zeller were acquired in Saturday's trade. Daniels was a 2022 first-round pick.\n\nThe trade created a surplus of options at center. There has been speculation the Hawks could trade Clint Capela, who has shared time with Onyeka Okongwu. Fields said he was trying to reach an agreement with center Bruno Fernando to push back Wednesday's deadline to guarantee Fernando's $2.72 million salary for next season.\n\nBickerstaff confident he can turn around Pistons\n\nDETROIT -- J.B. Bickerstaff believes he can be the coach to finally turn around the Detroit Pistons, a once-proud franchise that has had the NBA's worst record the last two seasons.\n\nThe Pistons, who have lost a league-record 14 straight playoff games dating to 2008, hired Bickerstaff after he was fired by the Cleveland Cavaliers, a franchise the coach helped improve over four seasons.\n\nBickerstaff took over the Cavs in 2020, when John Beilein exited with a 14-40 record. He led them to the playoffs in each of the last two years, winning a first-round series last season.\n\n\"I think the proof is there that we have the experience,\" Bickerstaff said Wednesday when he was formally introduced as Detroit's third coach in three years.\n\nThe Pistons were drawn to the 45-year-old Bickerstaff because he previously led three NBA teams, giving him a track record to help sell his vision to a mix of young players and veterans.\n\n\"You want somebody who can come in here and hit the ground running, and who's done this before,\" Pistons president of basketball operations Trajan Langdon said. \"Especially with a young team coming off a difficult season, positivity was important.\n\n\"We felt experience was important. The players needed to feel like the person coming in here knew what he was talking about.\"\n\nBickerstaff, who twice finished among the top five in NBA Coach of the Year voting, was 170-159 in four-plus seasons in Cleveland and had six victories in the playoffs.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "heraldcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HeraldCourier.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@heraldcourier.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landry_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landry Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Little League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trae Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Softball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boone,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boone, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boone, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dejounte_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dejounte Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._J._Liddell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E.

Bickerstaff believes he can be successful in Detroit", "body": "DETROIT -- Fired in May, J.B. Bickerstaff sat in Detroit newly hired on Wednesday by a franchise looking to mimic the success he had found in Cleveland. It's familiar territory.\n\nDwane Casey sat where Bickerstaff was seven seasons ago, fresh off a coach of the year award and having helped make the Toronto Raptors a contender before he was relieved of his duties. Monty Williams sat in that seat a year ago, weeks after being let go by the Phoenix Suns and then handsomely paid by owner Tom Gores to be the new leader of the Pistons.\n\nThe two people who warmed Bickerstaff's seat before his arrival had differing paths in the Motor City. Casey was originally hired to turn the team into a playoff mainstay, and he did get Detroit into the postseason in his first year before the organization decided to rebuild. As for Williams, he was hired to steer a young team out of the abyss and toward an upward trajectory. However, the result was the worst season in franchise history.\n\nBickerstaff, who the Cavaliers fired in the offseason, becomes the new head coach of the Pistons during one of the more delicate times in their long history. The stench from last season's disaster still stings the nostrils. Detroit has won 31 games over the last two seasons combined. Its win-loss record of late led to ownership hiring Trajan Langdon to run basketball operations, and he's already added much-needed veteran help to a young roster that desperately needed it. Bickerstaff has to walk a tightrope of developing the roster's emerging talent while also making sure that nothing close to what happened last season happens again. Easy, right?\n\nIt's a tough situation to walk into, especially for a coach who could have waited until next summer and, very likely, gotten a job in a more stable situation. Bickerstaff didn't want to wait, though. He wanted this job. Why?\n\n\"It was my conversations with Trajan, to begin with,\" Bickerstaff said in his introductory news conference. \"I had a great feeling that this organization was heading in the right direction and was being led by the right people. For me, going through some of the things that I've gone through in the past, the people that you work with ... being of a shared vision and willingness to commit to one another and partner with one another, I thought this group, as a whole, had a great vision. Tom has given every resource to go out and execute that vision.\n\n\"Then, obviously, you study the team. I took a deep dive as soon as I could. Obviously, I have experience of playing against them four times a year for so many years, but I knew the players well. I believed in their ability and talent. There is a steps process that we have to take, and we're really aware of that and Trajan and I are united in that. It just doesn't happen for everyone overnight.\"\n\nBickerstaff signed a fully guaranteed, four-year deal that has a fifth year as a team option. Bickerstaff said he didn't expect the Pistons job to be available and had contemplated waiting. He decided to take the job because of Langdon and Gores, as well as the talented roster.\n\nDetroit is still technically rebuilding, but this season won't be like the previous ones. Bickerstaff said players will have to earn their minutes. So far this offseason, Langdon has ushered in a handful of vets who have produced as starting-level players for several seasons. There are now legitimate options, and there will be accountability.\n\n\"We'll look and find the best lineups, and then we'll make guys compete for opportunities. ... If you want to build a competitive team, you can't just go and give handouts,\" Bickerstaff said. \"People have to earn it.\"\n\nThe Cavaliers were one of the top defenses in the NBA under Bickerstaff, and it was anchored by a two-big lineup Detroit attempted to mimic under previous GM Troy Weaver. That doesn't mean Bickerstaff will transfer that approach to the Pistons. He spoke about how the personnel in Cleveland called for the two-big lineup to maximize success. He even mentioned how spacing -- which Langdon has spent this offseason adding through the likes of Tobias Harris, Malik Beasley and Tim Hardaway Jr. -- will be beneficial to those who the organization needs to develop.\n\n\"You want to surround the guys you're developing with guys who make them better,\" Bickerstaff said. \"I think with the young guys that we have, we're trying our best to put them in positions of success. Success a lot of times, on offense, specifically, starts with that space. When you have a guy like Cade (Cunningham), who has the wiggle that he has and can get to the paint and create, when you have the bigs that you have in Jalen (Duren) and Isaiah (Stewart) that can put pressure on the paint, it's paramount that you have the proper spacing around them, so that they can see success and gain confidence. That's how they'll continue to get better.\"\n\nDetroit appears to have a leader with modern-day thinking in Langdon and a coach in Bickerstaff who, while many believed was playing too throwback of a game in Cleveland, appears willing to adapt to the roster he has, rather than force his beliefs on the team. That, at the very least, is a start.\n\nA year ago, many in Detroit felt good about where the organization was going, and it ended up backfiring. It's easy to feel that way now, too, as a new era of decision-makers has been ushered in. The team has signed proven, experienced players in free agency. Everyone loves shiny, new things. Detroit also has its franchise players locked up for the next half-decade. Who is to say if it'll all work?\n\nAt the very least, though, none of this feels forced. It doesn't feel contrived out of money or desperation. Everyone in a position of power appears to want to be here. Everyone appears invested in working together. Everyone appears focused on making the Pistons good again.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Gores", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Gores"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwane_Casey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dwane Casey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan_Langdon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trajan Langdon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trajan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winning_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winning percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Raptors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Raptors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Weaver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troy Weaver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hardaway Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobias Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Beasley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malik Beasley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/10151237/GettyImages-2118535576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722576", "eventUri": "eng-9722576", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Saturday's trade with the New Orleans Pelicans added four veterans to the roster, plus two future first-round draft picks, for Murray.\n\nThat leaves the Hawks with an overstocked roster and the possibility that more veterans could leave Atlanta.\n\nFields said Wednesday that the decision to trade Murray, who joined Trae Young in Atlanta's high-scoring backcourt the last two seasons, followed the conclusion that \"we wanted to reshape some things.\"\n\n\"It was hard decisions, challenging,\" Fields said. \"We knew that where we ultimately want to be was going to require some challenging decisions. ... So from now until the start of the season, we'll have some more tough decisions to make.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Liddell, a 2022 second-round draft pick who was part of the package of veterans acquired from the Pelicans, said Risacher \"has got a lot of potential to be really great. He's a tough shot-maker. He's tall. It's going to be really tough to contest his shots. And he can handle the ball for a guy so tall.\"\n\nLiddell, who also will play on the Hawks' Summer League team, guard Dyson Daniels, forward/center Larry Nance Jr. and center Cody Zeller were acquired in Saturday's trade. Daniels was a 2022 first-round pick.\n\nThe trade created a surplus of options at center. There has been speculation the Hawks could trade Clint Capela, who has shared time with Onyeka Okongwu. Fields said he was trying to reach an agreement with center Bruno Fernando to push back Wednesday's deadline to guarantee Fernando's $2.72 million salary for next season.\n\nBickerstaff confident he can turn around Pistons\n\nDETROIT -- J.B. Bickerstaff believes he can be the coach to finally turn around the Detroit Pistons, a once-proud franchise that has had the NBA's worst record the last two seasons.\n\nThe Pistons, who have lost a league-record 14 straight playoff games dating to 2008, hired Bickerstaff after he was fired by the Cleveland Cavaliers, a franchise the coach helped improve over four seasons.\n\nBickerstaff took over the Cavs in 2020, when John Beilein exited with a 14-40 record. He led them to the playoffs in each of the last two years, winning a first-round series last season.\n\n\"I think the proof is there that we have the experience,\" Bickerstaff said Wednesday when he was formally introduced as Detroit's third coach in three years.\n\nThe Pistons were drawn to the 45-year-old Bickerstaff because he previously led three NBA teams, giving him a track record to help sell his vision to a mix of young players and veterans.\n\n\"You want somebody who can come in here and hit the ground running, and who's done this before,\" Pistons president of basketball operations Trajan Langdon said. \"Especially with a young team coming off a difficult season, positivity was important.\n\n\"We felt experience was important. The players needed to feel like the person coming in here knew what he was talking about.\"\n\nBickerstaff, who twice finished among the top five in NBA Coach of the Year voting, was 170-159 in four-plus seasons in Cleveland and had six victories in the playoffs.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "siouxcityjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sioux City Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@siouxcityjournal.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landry_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landry Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCook_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McCook Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trae Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Woodbury County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Woodbury County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_City,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sioux City, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sioux City, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dejounte_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dejounte Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._J._Liddell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E.

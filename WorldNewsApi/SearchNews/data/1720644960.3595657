He can be legally denied certain public housing, but he could soon live at the White House. And he cannot legally possess a firearm in any state, but he could soon command the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal. Donald Trump joined the nearly 20 million Americans with felony convictions when a jury in New York found him guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree on May 30. But unlike the millions of Americans re-entering society after conviction and incarcerations, who face countless barriers to decent jobs, housing, healthcare, childcare, and the ability to vote, among other hurdles, Trump can rely on his immense wealth, influence and potential path to the presidency to avoid them. It is unlikely he will face any jailtime (Manhattan prosecutors are not seeking any), and if he wins the 2024 presidential election, the terms of a probationary sentence \u2013 the most likely outcome \u2013 could be jammed up by his challenges in federal courts to allow him to do the kinds of things one would need to do as president, like travel out of state. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely different world,\u201d according to Wanda Bertram, communications specialist with the nonpartisan nonprofit research organization Prison Policy Initiative. \u201cHe\u2019s not even going to think about the kind of barriers that people who are coming out of prison are going to face,\u201d she tells The Independent. \u201cDonald Trump is going to be able to avoid not just the immediate consequences of a felony conviction, as they apply to most people, but also the downstream consequences,\u201d she says. \u201cThis thing that tends to happen to people where, because of their felony conviction, they can\u2019t get a job, they can\u2019t get housing, they can\u2019t get healthcare, and then, because of the combination of those things, then they\u2019re reincarcerated or convicted for something else.\u201d The heaps of contradictions facing Trump\u2019s post-conviction life \u2013 can\u2019t have a gun but can control the nation\u2019s military, can\u2019t hold certain occupational licenses but can be president, can\u2019t vote in certain states but can be the thing people are voting for \u2013 were probably not the dilemmas that the nation\u2019s founders considered. But they expose the wild gaps between a powerful billionaire navigating the criminal justice system and the rest of us. Nearly four out of every 10 people in state prison were jobless in the month leading up to their arrest, according the Prison Policy Initiative. Black people (46 per cent) and women (53 per cent) in state prisons were more likely to have not had a job in that time, the group found. More than half a million Americans return to their communities each year after incarceration, but most face job rejection and long streaks of unemployment thanks to discriminatory hiring practices, occupational license restrictions and short-term and unstable, low-paying positions. \u201cIf you\u2019re Donald Trump, you can kind of make your own work,\u201d Bertram says. \u201cThat\u2019s the privilege of having a lot of money \u2013 you can gin up some new venture.\u201d Many state licensing laws include blanket disqualifications for people with criminal records, meaning that state boards don\u2019t have to scrutinize applications or think twice about revoking licenses if they come from a person with certain felony convictions. Other state boards may have more discretion to grant licenses to applicants with a criminal conviction, but for millions of people with records, \u201cthey\u2019re just one more applicant,\u201d Bertram says. \u201cThey\u2019re just a number,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can try to appeal the decision, and they don\u2019t hear anything. \u2026 Trump and so many billionaires and millionaires have so many other avenues of recourse to try to pull strings. \u2026 If you\u2019re formerly incarcerated, you probably don\u2019t have access to even the kind of legal assistance that might be able to help you overcome this.\u201d Trump can be president again, but state-level occupational licensing restrictions would block any other person with felony convictions from a range of jobs across the country. Some of those restrictions, according to the Prison Policy Initiative and the National Conference of State Legislatures: Trump can\u2019t work for a casino in Illinois or a vet in Indiana, in pest control in North Carolina, he can\u2019t sell a car in Mississippi, or work in any healthcare setting in Virginia. Even in New York, if he wanted a real estate brokers license, he would need permission from the secretary of state. In Florida, he can\u2019t be a firefighter or legally tend bar at his Mar-a-Lago compound; Florida law prohibits bars from employing bartenders who have been convicted of a felony within five years. And unlike many people with felony convictions, Trump will still probably be able to vote for himself in the upcoming election, as long as he is not behind bars. He can still vote from New York or his home in Florida if he is on probation. Voting laws in Florida \u2013 where Trump is registered to vote \u2013 defer to the rules in the state where a person was convicted. The state\u2019s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis even announced he would personally ensure Trump could vote, despite rolling back voting rights for thousands of Florida residents with felony convictions. In 2018, Florida voters overwhelmingly supported a measure to restore voting rights for most Floridians with convictions who had completed the terms of their sentence. But in 2019, DeSantis signed a law mandating that certain people with felony convictions can only regain their voting rights after they pay all related fines, fees and restitution. \u201cThat would be easy for [Trump] to do,\u201d Bertram says. \u201cFor most people who are coming out of prison, in Florida or elsewhere, they are saddled with a lot of criminal justice-related fees that are hard for them to pay off because they get in the way of other things that they need to do to get back on their feet right. \u2026 There\u2019s a magnitude of difference between the fines that he\u2019s paying, or the amount of money that he has, versus the amount of money that the average formerly incarcerated person or person with a felony conviction has and how much money they have to pay.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Trump\u2019s power and influence will help him avoid major hurdles facing millions of Americans with felony convictions trying to get back to work, Alex Woodward reports </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-convicted-felon-jobs-b2558874.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/07/19/2156408759.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:33:23", "author": "Alex Woodward", "authors": ["Alex Woodward"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.015}

Bob Menendez (D-NJ) by giving his wife a Mercedes-Benz convertible on the condition the sitting senator would \u201cstop and kill\u201d any criminal investigation looking into his company. Jose Uribe, the prosecution\u2019s star witness in Menendez\u2019s federal corruption trial in Manhattan, told jurors he made the deal with Nadine Menendez, who went by Nadine Arslanian at the time, during a March 2019 telephone call. \u201cNadine will contact Sen. Menendez, use his influence and power to do anything possible to stop and kill investigations, so my family \u2026 so it doesn\u2019t get to my family, and my family doesn\u2019t get hurt,\u201d Uribe testified. \u201cShe agreed to the terms.\u201d Prosecutors have spent the past four weeks trying to piece together what they claim is a sprawling, yearslong bribery scheme by the Menendezs. Uribe, the prosecution\u2019s lone cooperating witness, has pleaded guilty to multiple state and federal crimes linked to his businesses. Uribe testified his friend Wael Hana, a co-defendant in the trial, told him in early 2018 there were multiple state criminal investigations swirling around the trucking company of a friend of his as well as his own insurance business. Hana allegedly said he could make those investigations disappear if Uribe was willing to spend $200,000 to $250,000. Uribe agreed. Hana told Uribe he would go to Arslanian, who had started dating the senator that year, and make the deal. Uribe held a July 13, 2018, political fundraiser for Menendez that raised $50,000. There was no mention of the backroom deal at the party or afterparty, both of which the senator attended. Later that year, an investigator from the attorney general\u2019s office asked to interview one of Uribe\u2019s employees. Uribe testified he was \u201cnot happy\u201d and texted Hana to get the senator to intervene in the probes. Hana set up an October 2018 dinner meeting but there was no mention of the deal. \u201cNothing was discussed there of value, I will say,\u201d Uribe testified. \u201cIt was a pointless, a pointless meeting.\u201d Uribe said he began communicating directly with Nadine Arslanian in March 2019 and promised that he would buy her a car if she delivered on the deal. Uribe\u2019s testimony will continue Monday with cross examination. \u201cNext week, we get the truth,\u201d Menendez said just before stepping into a car Friday afternoon at the federal courthouse. Menendez has been charged with bribery, fraud, extortion, obstruction of justice, and acting as a foreign agent of Egypt. He has pleaded not guilty. Nadine Menendez has also been charged, but her trial has been delayed for health reasons. New Jersey real estate developer Fred Daibes and Hana are on trial alongside Menendez.

They have pleaded not guilty and claim the gifts were given out of generosity. Prosecutor Laura Pomerantz has accused Menendez of putting \u201cgreed first\u201d and told jurors he sold out his constituents, during opening arguments.", "summary": "A New Jersey businessman testified Friday that he bribed Sen.

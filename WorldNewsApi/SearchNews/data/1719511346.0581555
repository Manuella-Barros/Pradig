{"id": 223773946, "title": "Limerick find extra gear in second half to ease past challenge of Waterford", "text": "A third successive Munster hurling final against Clare now beckons but just as important is their safe progression from the province to keep them on track for a coveted fifth success All-Ireland title. There was a bit of Waterford turbulence in the third quarter when Shane Bennett plundered a second goal and the visitors kept nipping away, stubbornly refusing to yield. And as the clock approached 60 minutes they were still hanging in after P\u00e1draig Fitzgerald had cut the gap to two, 0-21 to 2-13. But then Limerick took off and in the last 13 minutes they hit nine points to Waterford's one in response. Some of their big names really stood up in this period, from Gearoid Hegarty to Barry Nash and even Cian Lynch who eventually got going. Waterford fought gamely for 60 minutes but ultimately their Munster Championship exit had its source in their failure to lock down a lead at home against Tipperary in the second round. They'll have regrets about that, not here where they were up against too many elements, not least the seven-day turnaround from the defeat to Clare. Limerick had as many wides as points in the opening half and really sold themselves short with their shooting in that period. But they were dominant and the physical difference told in almost every battle, a feature of the game. At one stage near the end of the half Jamie Barron scooped up possession but was encircled instantly by Kyle Hayes, Hegarty and Will O'Donoghue, an almost 20 foot ring of green steel. Only one outcome. It was that way throughout and not helped by Waterford's propensity to go short and keep it as tight as possible. It invited in the Limerick marauders with 10 of their 14 first half scores coming off turnovers. Hayes was immense in that period for Limerick, landing three, points, while Tom Morrissey chipped in with three two as gaps opened up. Seamus Flanagan had been off target from three shots in his 20 minutes before a hamstring injury forced him off. Shane O'Brien was a surprise replacement, ahead of Adam English and Donnacha \u00d3 Dalaigh who had been widely used in previous games. But O'Brien justified selection, instantly scoring two points and setting up another for Morrissey before adding a third in the second half. It was an inspired management choice. Limerick had a couple of penalty claims for challenges on Hegarty. The first saw Tadhg De Burca get the ball first before the follow through caught Hegarty, the second had stronger claims, a trip on Hegarty from Ian Kenny though not deliberate, it appeared. Both were overlooked by referee Michael Kennedy. Waterford got their first half goal from a clever Shane Bennett flick to touch home a free from brother Stephen that fell short on 16 minutes. It kept them in it as much as Limerick's wastefulness and even though Limerick extended close to half-time to lead by 0-14 to 1-6, Waterford were entitled to feel that with wind advantage to come they were still in it. Shane Bennett's second goal came after Nicky Quaid had saved from Kevin Mahony and Dessie Hutchinson followed up on 46 minutes to make it 0-19 to 2-9. But Limerick power overwhelmed Davy Fitzgerald's side with Cathal O'Neill once again underlining how important he is to the champions. now.

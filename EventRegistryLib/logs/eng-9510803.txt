Raises $227 Million at $977 Million Valuation to Empower Software Teams With AI", "body": "PALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Apr 24, 2024--\n\nAI coding assistance startup Augment Inc. emerged from stealth today and announced its $227 million Series B round at a $977 million post-money valuation with investments from Sutter Hill Ventures, Index Ventures, Innovation Endeavors, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Meritech Capital. This brings Augment's total funding to $252 million, following its $25 million Series A led by Sutter Hill Ventures. The latest capital infusion will be used by Augment to accelerate product development and build out its product, engineering and go-to-market functions as the company gears up for rapid growth.\n\nThe company is founded by Igor Ostrovsky, former chief architect at Pure Storage and software engineer at Microsoft, and Guy Gur-Ari, an AI researcher who hails from Google. It is led by industry veterans Scott Dietzen, whose previous leadership experience includes Pure Storage, Yahoo! and WebLogic / BEA Systems, and Dion Almaer, an alumnus of Google, Shopify, Mozilla and Palm. Augment's engineering team boasts deep AI and systems expertise, with alumni from Google, Meta, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Databricks, Snowflake, VMware and Pure Storage.\n\nSutter Hill Ventures Managing Director Mike Speiser said, \"Augment has built a truly brilliant team, among the best in enterprise AI, and as good as any team we have ever helped put together. They have a stellar track record of delivering best-in-class solutions and leading companies from early stage to category leader to IPO. We are already seeing great things from Augment, and we are just getting started.\"\n\nOver $1 trillion is spent on software engineering annually, according to Gartner, yet most companies remain dissatisfied with the programs they produce and consume. Software is too often fragile, complex and expensive to maintain with development teams bogged down with long backlogs for feature requests, bug fixes, security patches, integration requests, migrations and upgrades. AI is hailed as the long-awaited remedy, with Gartner predicting that \"by 2027, 50% of enterprise software engineers will use ML-powered coding tools.\" However, current AI coding assistants don't adequately understand the programmer's intent, improve software quality nor facilitate team productivity, and they don't properly protect intellectual property. In fact, a 2023 Gartner report on AI and developer experience found that tools like pair programming currently only offer \"incremental, quality-of-life improvements to developers rather than significant boosts in productivity.\"\n\nAs Eric Schmidt, Founding Partner at Innovation Endeavors and former CEO of Google explained, \"Software remains far too expensive and painful to develop. AI is poised to transform coding, and after surveying the landscape, we came away convinced that Augment has both the best team and recipe for empowering programmers and their organizations to deliver more and better software.\"\n\n\"Software engineering is rapidly evolving into a collaboration between human and artificial intelligence,\" observed Igor Ostrovsky, co-founder of Augment Inc. \"At Augment, we are working with extraordinary focus to empower teams around the world with AI, enabling them to build better software.\"\n\n\"As large language models emerged a few years ago, this team saw their potential to make programming dramatically more productive and yield much higher-quality software,\" said Scott Dietzen, CEO of Augment Inc. \"Current AI for code platforms are falling well short of realizing the potential of generative AI, and we are thrilled to be launching a product to close this gap!\"\n\nCEO of Keeta, Ty Schenk, explained, \"Augment is solving real world engineering challenges with their contextual awareness of our code base. We are seeing a >40% increase in developer productivity across the board.\"\n\n\"AI has the potential to make software developers 10x more productive, but achieving this requires deep research into AI for code coupled with advanced systems engineering,\" shared Guy Gur-Ari, co-founder of Augment Inc. \"It's exciting to be part of a team that is uniquely positioned to deliver on this promise, and truly transform the way software development gets done.\"\n\n\"The best software comes from augmenting developers, not replacing them. We believe that AI technology can help developers stay focused on the joy of coding while eliminating the toil that can slow progress to a crawl. To achieve this vision, the AI needs to have an expert understanding of codebases, operate at the speed of thought, support teams instead of just individuals, and carefully protect intellectual property,\" explained Dion Almaer, VP of product at Augment Inc. \"As someone who has dedicated my career to meeting the needs of software engineers, I am confident that Augment is poised to deliver this new experience and revolutionize software development at scale.\"\n\nDietzen continued, \"It's clear we're entering a once-in-a-generation pivot point in software development. At Augment, not only do I get to work with many of the brightest minds in AI, we're fortunate to have the backing of the world's leading investors to fuel our vision. Augment's AI platform naturally and seamlessly empowers every developer.\"\n\nTo learn more about Augment and secure your spot to transform your coding:\n\nVisit www.augmentcode.comJoin the waitlist for Augment's Early Access Program\n\nAdditional Investor Quotes\n\n\"We are strong believers in Augment's potential to not only eat the code assistant market, but redefine how software engineering is performed at scale!\"\n\n- Shardul Shah, Partner, Index Partners\n\n\"At Lightspeed, we believe there's a massive market opportunity for AI to transform software development.

Raises $227 Million at $977 Million Valuation to Empower Software Teams With AI", "body": "After-hours movers: Cadence Design Systems, Cleveland-Cliffs, Riot Platforms, and more\n\nInvestors Include Sutter Hill Ventures, Index Ventures, Innovation Endeavors, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Meritech Capital\n\nPALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AI coding assistance startup Augment Inc. emerged from stealth today and announced its $227 million Series B round at a $977 million post-money valuation with investments from Sutter Hill Ventures, Index Ventures, Innovation Endeavors, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Meritech Capital. This brings Augment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s total funding to $252 million, following its $25 million Series A led by Sutter Hill Ventures. The latest capital infusion will be used by Augment to accelerate product development and build out its product, engineering and go-to-market functions as the company gears up for rapid growth.\n\nThe company is founded by Igor Ostrovsky, former chief architect at Pure Storage and software engineer at Microsoft, and Guy Gur-Ari, an AI researcher who hails from Google. It is led by industry veterans Scott Dietzen, whose previous leadership experience includes Pure Storage, Yahoo! and WebLogic / BEA Systems, and Dion Almaer, an alumnus of Google, Shopify, Mozilla and Palm. Augment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s engineering team boasts deep AI and systems expertise, with alumni from Google, Meta, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Databricks, Snowflake, VMware and Pure Storage.\n\nSutter Hill Ventures Managing Director Mike Speiser said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAugment has built a truly brilliant team, among the best in enterprise AI, and as good as any team we have ever helped put together. They have a stellar track record of delivering best-in-class solutions and leading companies from early stage to category leader to IPO. We are already seeing great things from Augment, and we are just getting started.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOver $1 trillion is spent on software engineering annually, according to Gartner, yet most companies remain dissatisfied with the programs they produce and consume. Software is too often fragile, complex and expensive to maintain with development teams bogged down with long backlogs for feature requests, bug fixes, security patches, integration requests, migrations and upgrades. AI is hailed as the long-awaited remedy, with Gartner predicting that \u00e2\u0080\u009cby 2027, 50% of enterprise software engineers will use ML-powered coding tools.\u00e2\u0080\u009d However, current AI coding assistants don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t adequately understand the programmer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intent, improve software quality nor facilitate team productivity, and they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t properly protect intellectual property. In fact, a 2023 Gartner report on AI and developer experience found that tools like pair programming currently only offer \u00e2\u0080\u009cincremental, quality-of-life improvements to developers rather than significant boosts in productivity.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs Eric Schmidt, Founding Partner at Innovation Endeavors and former CEO of Google explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoftware remains far too expensive and painful to develop. AI is poised to transform coding, and after surveying the landscape, we came away convinced that Augment has both the best team and recipe for empowering programmers and their organizations to deliver more and better software.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSoftware engineering is rapidly evolving into a collaboration between human and artificial intelligence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d observed Igor Ostrovsky, co-founder of Augment Inc. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAt Augment, we are working with extraordinary focus to empower teams around the world with AI, enabling them to build better software.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAs large language models emerged a few years ago, this team saw their potential to make programming dramatically more productive and yield much higher-quality software,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Scott Dietzen, CEO of Augment Inc. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCurrent AI for code platforms are falling well short of realizing the potential of generative AI, and we are thrilled to be launching a product to close this gap!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCEO of Keeta, Ty Schenk, explained, \u00e2\u0080\u009cAugment is solving real world engineering challenges with their contextual awareness of our code base. We are seeing a >40% increase in developer productivity across the board.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAI has the potential to make software developers 10x more productive, but achieving this requires deep research into AI for code coupled with advanced systems engineering,\u00e2\u0080\u009d shared Guy Gur-Ari, co-founder of Augment Inc. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exciting to be part of a team that is uniquely positioned to deliver on this promise, and truly transform the way software development gets done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe best software comes from augmenting developers, not replacing them. We believe that AI technology can help developers stay focused on the joy of coding while eliminating the toil that can slow progress to a crawl. To achieve this vision, the AI needs to have an expert understanding of codebases, operate at the speed of thought, support teams instead of just individuals, and carefully protect intellectual property,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explained Dion Almaer, VP of product at Augment Inc. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAs someone who has dedicated my career to meeting the needs of software engineers, I am confident that Augment is poised to deliver this new experience and revolutionize software development at scale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nDietzen continued, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering a once-in-a-generation pivot point in software development. At Augment, not only do I get to work with many of the brightest minds in AI, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fortunate to have the backing of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leading investors to fuel our vision. Augment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI platform naturally and seamlessly empowers every developer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo learn more about Augment and secure your spot to transform your coding:\n\nAdditional Investor Quotes\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe are strong believers in Augment's potential to not only eat the code assistant market, but redefine how software engineering is performed at scale!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\" Shardul Shah, Partner, Index Partners\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt Lightspeed, we believe there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a massive market opportunity for AI to transform software development. Augment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exceptional team seamlessly empowers software engineers to deliver higher quality code far more easily, quickly and collaboratively. Lightspeed is thrilled to be joining Augment to help make the world's software better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\" Ravi Mhatre, Founder and Managing Director, Lightspeed\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAugment represents Sutter Hill Ventures\u00e2\u0080\u0099 first big bet on AI. This is an extremely talented team that marries the best in systems and cloud programming with unique breadth and depth in AI research. Great things are coming soon.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\" Palmer Rampell, Managing Director, Sutter Hill Ventures\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMeritech is thrilled to be backing an extraordinarily talented Augment team. In our due diligence, we found Augment's depth and breadth of AI talent to be greater than that of all the other startups in the space combined.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\" Alex Clayton, General Partner, Meritech Capital\n\nAbout Augment Inc.\n\nFounded in 2022, Augment Inc. emerged from stealth in 2024 to bring AI coding assistance innovations to developers and software teams. The company is backed by Sutter Hill Ventures, Index Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Innovation Endeavors and Meritech Capital. Augment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s expert understanding of each codebase and dependencies removes the toil in developers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 workdays, so teams can once again experience the joy of coding.",

Meanwhile, Gartner estimates that over half of organizations are currently piloting or have already deployed AI-driven coding assistants, and that 75% of developers will use coding assistants in some form by 2028.\n\nEx-Microsoft software developer Igor Ostrovsky believes that, soon, there won't be a developer who doesn't use AI in their workflows.\n\n\"Software engineering remains a difficult and all-too-often tedious and frustrating job, particularly at scale,\" he told TechCrunch. \"AI can improve software quality, team productivity and help restore the joy of programming.\"\n\nSo Ostrovsky decided to build the AI-powered coding platform that he himself would want to use.\n\nToday, that platform -- Augment -- emerged from stealth with $252 million in funding at a near-unicorn ($977 million) post-money valuation. With investments from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and VCs including Index Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Innovation Endeavors and Meritech Capital, Augment aims to shake up the still-nascent market for generative AI coding technologies.\n\n\"Most companies are dissatisfied with the programs they produce and consume; software is too often fragile, complex and expensive to maintain with development teams bogged down with long backlogs for feature requests, bug fixes, security patches, integration requests, migrations and upgrades,\" Ostrovsky said. \"Augment has both the best team and recipe for empowering programmers and their organizations to deliver high-quality software quicker.\"\n\nOstrovsky spent nearly seven years at Microsoft before joining Pure Storage, a startup developing flash data storage hardware and software products, as a founding engineer. While at Microsoft, Ostrovsky worked on components of Midori, a next-generation operating system the company never released but whose concepts have made their way into other Microsoft projects over the last decade.\n\nIn 2022, Ostrovsky and Guy Gur-Ari, previously an AI research scientist at Google, teamed up to create Augment's MVP. To fill out the startup's executive ranks, Ostrovsky and Gur-Ari brought on Scott Dietzen, ex-CEO of Pure Storage, and Dion Almaer, formerly a Google engineering director and a VP of engineering at Shopify.\n\nAugment remains a strangely hush-hush operation.\n\nIn our conversation, Ostrovsky wasn't willing to say much about the user experience or even the generative AI models driving Augment's features (whatever they may be) -- save that Augment is using fine-tuned \"industry leading\" open models of some sort.\n\nHe did say how Augment plans to make money: standard software-as-a-service subscriptions. Pricing and other details will be revealed later this year, Ostrovsky added, closer to Augment's planned GA release.\n\n\"Our funding provides many years of runway to continue to build what we believe to be the best team in enterprise AI,\" he said. \"We're accelerating product development and building out Augment's product, engineering and go-to-market functions as the company gears up for rapid growth.\"\n\nRapid growth is perhaps the best shot Augment has at making waves in an increasingly cutthroat industry.\n\nPractically every tech giant offers its own version of an AI coding assistant. Microsoft has GitHub Copilot, which is by far the firmest entrenched with over 1.3 million paying individual and 50,000 enterprise customers as of February. Amazon has AWS' CodeWhisperer. And Google has Gemini Code Assist, recently rebranded from Duet AI for Developers.\n\nElsewhere, there's a torrent of coding assistant startups -- Magic, Tabnine, Codegen, Refact, TabbyML, Sweep, Laredo and Cognition (which reportedly just raised $175 million) to name a few. Harness and JetBrains, which developed the Kotlin programming language, recently released their own. So did Sentry (albeit with more of a cybersecurity bent).\n\nCan they all -- plus Augment now -- do business harmoniously together? It seems unlikely. Eye-watering compute costs alone make the AI coding assistant business a challenging one to maintain. Overruns related to training and serving models forced generative AI coding startup Kite to shut down in December 2022. Even Copilot loses money -- to the tune of ~$20 a month to ~$80 a month per user, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nOstrovsky implies that there's momentum behind Augment already -- he claims that \"hundreds\" of software developers across \"dozens\" of companies including payment startup Keeta (which is also Eric Schmidt-backed) are using Augment in early access. But will the uptake sustain? That's the million-dollar question, indeed.\n\nI also wonder if Augment has made any steps toward solving the technical setbacks plaguing code-generating AI, particularly around vulnerabilities.\n\nAn analysis by GitClear, the developer of the code analytics tool of the same name, found that coding assistants are resulting in more mistaken code being pushed to codebases, creating headaches for software maintainers. Security researchers have warned that generative coding tools tools can amplify existing bugs and exploits in projects. And Stanford researchers have found that developers who accept code recommendations from AI assistants tend to produce less secure code.\n\nThen there's copyright to worry about.\n\nAugment's models were undoubtedly trained on publicly available data, like all generative AI models -- some of which may've been copyrighted or under a restrictive license. Some vendors have argued that fair use doctrine shields them from copyright claims while at the same time rolling out tools to mitigate potential infringement. But that hasn't stopped coders from filing class action lawsuits over what they allege are open licensing and IP violations.\n\nTo all this, Ostrovsky says: \"Current AI coding assistants don't adequately understand the programmer's intent, improve software quality nor facilitate team productivity, and they don't properly protect intellectual property. Augment's engineering team boasts deep AI and systems expertise. We're poised to bring AI coding assistance innovations to developers and software teams.\"\n\nAugment, which is based in Palo Alto, has ~50 employees at present; Ostrovsky expects that number to double by the end of the year.", "source": {"uri": "techcrunch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCrunch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_wiggers@techcrunch.com", "name": "Kyle Wiggers", "type":

The company says its mission is to empower developers with powerful AI capabilities that will ultimately transform the way software is developed.\n\nToday's round was led by high profile investors including former Google LLC Chief Executive Eric Schmidt and venture capital firms such as Index Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures and Lightspeed Partner Ventures, and marks the entrance of yet another well-funded player in the AI coding industry.\n\nAugment's co-founders include Igor Ostrovsky, a former chief architect at Pure Storage Inc. and software engineer at Microsoft Corp., and Guy Gur-Ari, who previously worked as an AI researcher at Google. The company is led by its Chief Executive Officer Scott Dietzen, whose resume lists Pure Storage, Yahoo! Inc. and BEA Systems Plc, a U.K.-based aerospace technology company.\n\nOstrovsky says software engineering is rapidly evolving to become a collaboration between human coders and AI. \"At Augment, we are working with extraordinary focus to empower teams around the world with AI, enabling them to build better software,\" he said.\n\nThe startup says its AI coding tools are designed to have an expert understanding of codebases and operate at the speed of thought. They're meant to support entire teams rather than just individuals, and have features built in that will ensure the protection of intellectual property.\n\nStrangely though, that's about all Augment is willing to share about its technology for now. Although the company claims to have exited stealth mode, its barebones website suggests that isn't really the case, providing few details on what, if anything, differentiates its platform from alternative and better established AI coding tools such as GitHub Inc.'s Copilot.\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Ostrovsky declined to comment on the user experience, nor was he willing to say anything about the generative AI models that power its platform, except to mention that it was fine-tuned using \"industry leading\" open models.\n\nThe company intends to reveal more when it launches its platform in general availability at some stage this year. It hasn't said exactly when that will happen, but it did reveal it plans to make money from standard software-as-a-service subscriptions.\n\nThe company's secrecy may have something to do with the highly competitive nature of the nascent industry it wants to disrupt. By far the biggest player in AI coding today is GitHub, whose Copilot tool is currently used by more than 1.3 million paying customers, including 50,000 enterprises. Other rivals include Amazon Web Services Inc.'s CodeWhisperer and Google's Gemini Code Assist, and a host of startups such as Tabnine Ltd., Codegen Inc., Refact, Cognition AI Inc., Laredo Labs Inc., TabbyML and Magic AI Inc.\n\nThe above players are all aiming to disrupt a software industry where annual spending exceeds $1 trillion, but still fails to meet the expectations of most enterprises. Augment cites a report by Gartner Inc. that notes how software remains fragile, complex and expensive to maintain, and says developer teams are often finding themselves bogged down with long backlogs for feature requests, security patches, bug fixes, integrations and so on.\n\nIt's believed that AI can help to fix the problems in software development, and Gartner forecasts that 50% of all enterprise software developers will be using AI-based coding tools by 2027.\n\nAugment wants to be a part of the coming AI coding revolution, but it remains to be seen if there will be enough room for so many different players. One of the main problems faced by AI coding startups is the eye-watering costs involved in developing generative AI. It's notable that GitHub reportedly loses between $20 and $80 per user with its Copilot tool due to the high cost of running the models that power it. In December 2022, the seven-year-old AI coding startup Kite.AI announced it was shutting down due to its high costs and an inability to properly monetize its offerings.\n\nFor its part, Augment says it has already generated a fair bit of momentum, claiming that hundreds of software developers from dozens of companies are using its platform in early access. One of those companies is the payments startup Keeta Inc., also backed by Eric Schmidt, which has reportedly seen a 40% increase in developer productivity since it started using Augement's tools.\n\nBesides having to fight tooth and nail for market share and revenue, Augment must also overcome some of the significant, industry-wide problems that continue to dog AI-generated code, such as vulnerabilities, poor quality code and copyright issues.\n\nFor example, a recent study by GitClear found that AI-powered coding assistants are pushing more poor-quality, error-strewn code into codebases, causing significant headaches for software maintainers who then have to go in and fix it manually. Moreover, there have been repeated warnings from security researchers about how generative AI-generated code is often littered with bugs and vulnerabilities.\n\nCopyright infringement may also derail a few AI coding startups. Most generative AI coding assistants and copilots tend to be trained on publicly available data, and there are fears that may are simply reusing existing, copyrighted code. While some AI firms have argued that the fair use doctrine protects their model's outputs from copyright infringement claims, a number of coders have filed class action lawsuits alleging intellectual property violations.\n\nMoreover, while Gartner may be bullish on the prospects of AI coding adoption, it conceded in a 2023 report that such tools currently only provide \"incremental quality-of-life improvements\" and fail to deliver significant productivity gains.\n\nAugment's CEO Dietzen did at least concede this point, and hinted that the startup might just have the solutions enterprises are waiting for. \"Current AI for code platforms are falling well short of realizing the potential of generative AI, and we are thrilled to be launching a product to close this gap,\" he promised.\n\nThe size of today's round certainly suggests Augment's backers are confident in its approach to AI coding, and with any luck it will soon become apparent why that is. The startup said it will use the funds to accelerate product development, build new features and expand its go-to-market team ahead of its general availability later this year.", "source": {"uri":

Sutter Hill led the Series A round, with Index Ventures, Eric Schmidt's Innovation Endeavors, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Meritech Capital joining the new round. Augment is going up against GitHub Copilot and other generative AI coding assistants, an increasingly competitive space for both startups and established brands.\n\n\"As large language models emerged a few years ago, this team saw their potential to make programming dramatically more productive and yield much higher-quality software. Current AI for code platforms are falling well short of realizing the potential of generative AI, and we are thrilled to be launching a product to close this gap!\" Augment CEO Scott Dietzen said. \"It's clear we're entering a once-in-a-generation pivot point in software development.\"\n\nAugment was founded two years ago by former Microsoft engineer Igor Ostrovsky and former Google AI engineer Guy Gur-Ari. They then brought on Dietzen as CEO. Dietzen had previously led data hardware and software firm Pure Storage, where Ostrovsky had been chief architect.\n\nAugment's coding AI is not entirely unique, but there's an enormous market for better software engineering. Many companies are keen to streamline and reduce the costs of the $1 trillion spent every year on software development, according to Gartner. Coding AI tools are mushrooming among major tech brands, as GitHub Copilot has been quickly joined by the likes of Google Gemini Code Assist, Amazon's CodeWhisperer, IBM's watsonx Code Assistant, Meta's Code Llama and the open-source Starcoder 2 from Hugging Face. That's before considering startups in the field attracting plenty of investment. For instance, generative AI coding assistance startup Tabnine scored a $25 million round in November, while February saw Codeium raise $65 million and Magic Ai raise $117 million for a coding 'coworker.'\n\nHowever, Augment claims current AI coding assistants fall short of understanding the programmer's intent and aren't always adept at the protection of intellectual property.\n\n\"Software engineering is rapidly evolving into a collaboration between human and artificial intelligence,\" Igor Ostrovsky said. \"At Augment, we are working with extraordinary focus to empower teams around the world with AI, enabling them to build better software.\"\n\nFollow @voicebotai Follow @erichschwartz\n\nMagic AI Raises $117M for Generative AI Coding 'Coworker' Not 'Copilot", "source": {"uri": "voicebot.ai", "dataType": "news", "title": "Voicebot.ai"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_hal_schwartz@voicebot.ai", "name": "Eric Hal Schwartz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eric Schmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_A_round", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Series A round"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Copilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GitHub Copilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unicorn (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightspeed_Venture_Partners", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightspeed Venture Partners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_Ventures", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Index Ventures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital_financing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venture capital financing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Storage", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pure Storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Architecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugging_Face", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hugging Face"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Ethics/Codes_of_Ethics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Ethics/Codes of Ethics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Metaprogramming", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Metaprogramming", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Standards_and_Codes", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Standards and Codes", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://voicebot.ai/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/augment.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510803", "eventUri": "eng-9510803", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

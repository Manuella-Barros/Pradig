USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREThumbs up\n\nThis isn't a good year to be an undrafted rookie receiver with the Packers. They return the seven receivers who were on their roster at the end of last season, and they drafted two more in the spring. But Montay Crockett is giving it a shot and holding his own. He had his best practice of camp Tuesday and has a quality that stands out. \"Speed,\" was the first word out of cornerback Davon House when asked what he thought about No. 9. (i.e, Crockett). Crockett ran the 40 in 4.39 seconds at his pro day at Georgia Southern in the spring, then a reported 4.30 at the regional combine in New Orleans. That 4.30 sounds a little too good to be true, but even if his actual time is more like 4.39, that's still fast. \"Probably one of the three fastest on the team,\" House said based on what he has seen on the practice field. Crockett finished last week on a good note in the preseason opener against Philadelphia with a contested catch and toe tap to stay in bounds to convert a third-and-10 in the fourth quarter. Then in practice Tuesday he had four catches - one from each of the four quarterbacks in camp - including three that converted third downs. Crockett is raw as a receiver coming from a college program that ran triple option his first three seasons before switching to a spread passing game his final year. So he's still looking at long odds to make the 53-man roster. But he has a shot at the practice squad, especially if he has more days like Tuesday.\n\nThumbs down\n\nAaron Jones is fighting for a roster spot, and after that for playing time at halfback behind Ty Montgomery. But it doesn't matter how well he plays if he fumbles, and in practice Tuesday he fumbled early in team drills. It was the fifth-round draft pick's third fumble in training camp, counting all drills. \"It's a horrible feeling,\" Jones said. \"The coaches get on you, as they should. Makes you feel bad, you don't want to let anybody down on your team, and definitely you don't want to be that guy that fumbles.\" Jones is one of three running backs general manager Ted Thompson drafted this year, along with Jamaal Williams (fourth round) and Devante Mays (seventh round). Williams so far is the front-runner for the No. 2 job behind Montgomery. What will matter most in determining the depth chart is performance in the preseason games, which is the only time the backs are tackled in camp. But even before that, protecting the ball is paramount.\n\nInjury report\n\nFour players didn't practice because of new injuries: Montgomery (lower leg), cornerback Damarious Randall (concussion), offensive lineman Don Barclay (ankle) and receiver DeAngelo Yancey (concussion). Three others dropped out during practice: safety Josh Jones (ankle/foot), safety Jermaine Whitehead (unidentified) and tight end Aaron Peck (unidentified). Still out were receiver Colby Pearson (ankle) and defensive lineman Montravius Adams (foot).\n\nBits and Pieces\n\n\" A Packers strength coach had Vince Biegel (foot) and Demetri Goodson (knee) running short sprints on the unused portion of the practice field late in Tuesday's practice. It's the first time the two have done that in public view this camp. Neither has passed a physical. \"For me, it's getting my spring back, getting my pop back in the foot,\" Biegel said. \"That's what we're doing here, we're getting that last pop back in the foot. We're getting the last details.\"\n\n\" With Barclay not practicing, Lucas Patrick worked as the center with the No. 2 offensive line.\n\n\" Tight end Richard Rodgers had a couple drops Tuesday but is playing with a splint on his broken finger.\n\n\" During a punt-cover drill, long snappers Brett Goode and Derek Hart split snaps - Goode took the first four, Hart the last four. All eight snaps appeared to be fine. The Packers didn't kick field goals.\n\nQuote of the day\n\nQuarterback Aaron Rodgers on the difference between practice reps and preseason game reps: \"Those practice reps are very important. That to me is more real football. If you look at the game the other night against Philly, I think they brought maybe one or two pressures. ... In practice, playing against our defense, it's multiple looks, fronts, personnel groupings, pressures, coverages. That to me is more what you're going to see in a game than preseason. Preseason to me is all about execution - can the guys line up, do what they're supposed to do? When they get the ball in their hands, are they making plays out there? The real football part, that's kind of saved for the practice reps.\"\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSEVIDEOS FROM GREEN BAY PACKERS TRAINING CAMP 2017Martellus Bennett: Anthem protests 'courageous' | 1:25\n\nGreen Bay Packers tight end Martellus Bennett talks to the media after training camp practice on Tuesday, August 15, 2017.

USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nGREEN BAY - As first impressions go, the initial attempts by the Green Bay Packers to execute screen passes landed somewhere between disjointed and disastrous during an exhibition game last week. They ran two of them on consecutive plays in the second quarter against the Philadelphia Eagles, and the net results were a sack, an injury and a pass batted down at the line of scrimmage.\n\nIt was an unsightly start for a team that has weaponized the screen pass in recent years, especially when former Packers tailback James Starks spelled Eddie Lacy in the backfield. Starks, who was released in February after a car accident left him with a severe concussion, caught 43 passes for 392 yards and three touchdowns in 2015, the best season of his career.\n\n\"I think he was just so elusive, you know?\" left guard Lane Taylor said. \"You would think he would be an easy guy to tackle, but he was so slippery and able to bend and cut and make people miss. If you weren't able to get a guy (blocked), he was able to move and make that guy miss.\"\n\nDOUGHERTY: Packers can't afford to play tag with Aaron Rodgers' contract\n\nRELATED: Ty Montgomery held out of practice with injury\n\nOn paper, the Packers have three running backs with the requisite skills and experience to do damage on screen passes. Starter Ty Montgomery is a converted wide receiver known for his ability in the open field, and rookie draft picks Jamaal Williams and Aaron Jones each caught more than 50 passes in their collegiate careers.\n\nThe challenge, then, is more choreographic than anything else: Young running backs learning to mesh with new offensive linemen and quarterbacks.\n\n\"It definitely takes a lot of reps for the running backs to finally get it,\" Taylor said. \"They can rep it all they want, but I feel like they don't really get it until you get in that game, mess it up a couple times and then you'll really have a feel for it.\n\n\"Because it's not the same every time for a running back. There could be a blitz or it could be a stunt at the line, so you have to get out different. So if you have to get out a different way and it takes longer, you've got to speed it up or slow it down. They'll eventually get it.\"\n\nAgainst the Eagles, coach Mike McCarthy waited until late in the second quarter to call his first screen passes of the 2017 season. He had Brett Hundley at quarterback and Jones, the fifth-round pick from UTEP, at running back. Up front, the second-string offensive line consisted of Jason Spriggs (LT), Lucas Patrick (LG), Don Barclay (C), Justin McCray (RG) and Kyle Murphy (RT).\n\nOn first and 10 from his own 35-yard line, Hundley dropped back and looked for Jones moving right to left across the field. Instead, Hundley saw three rushers in his face and nowhere to go with the football. Murphy and Spriggs had both been beaten, and poor timing along the interior of the line allowed a third rusher to break free early.\n\nHundley tried to escape and wound up tripping over Spriggs' foot, settling for a 12-yard loss. Up ahead, Barclay suffered an ankle injury that ended his night and left him in a boot.\n\nMcCarthy dialed up another screen on the very next play, flipping the call to the opposite side of the field. This time -- with Patrick sliding to center and rookie Kofi Amichia filling in at guard -- Hundley's pass toward Jones was batted down at the line of scrimmage after defensive end Steven Means turned the corner on Murphy to disrupt the play.\n\n\"I think it comes with experience,\" Hundley said. \"I think you sort of get a gist and a feel for how things time up. Because on screens, timing is a huge part of it. For the young guys, when they're not used to sort of the timing that we have, I think for them it's a big opportunity to sort of get in there during practice and sort of get a couple reps at it.\"\n\nSaid Jones: \"You have to have a two-count clock in your head, because the quarterback is going to be pressured. ... You have to play it smart: If the linebacker has you in man (coverage), it's kind of like hmm, what do I do? But usually you sit there and wait until the first offensive lineman gets out, so if (the linebacker) does have you in man coverage, (a lineman) is there to block him. You catch it, you turn it up and then get behind the other offensive linemen.\"\n\nOf course, there is something to be said for calling screens with the second-string offensive line rather than Taylor and the starters. Barclay, the elder statesman, had rookies and second-year players flanking him on either side, whereas the first-team line consists of veterans whose chemistry is a product of years rather than months or weeks.\n\nThe exception is right guard Jahri Evans, who joined the Packers as an undrafted free agent during the offseason to replace the departed T.J. Lang. As with any newcomer, Evans has spent the early portion of training camp learning the idiosyncrasies of his fellow linemen and quarterback Aaron Rodgers.\n\n\"There's always adjustment with every new person,\" Taylor said, \"just because I think everyone kind of runs them a little different. I don't think it's a standard deal from team to team. Just have to fill them in on it, how we run them.\"\n\nIronically, the Packers have been lethal with some of their screen passes in practice, especially behind the first-string line. Montgomery and Williams, who have taken the majority of reps with the starters, have gobbled up yards in chunks to the point where McCarthy hurled epithets at the defense earlier in camp.\n\n\"I feel like we've hit a bunch of good screens in practice,\" center Corey Linsley said. \"I can think of one or two that maybe there was a little bit of miscommunication on, but honestly in terms of things we have to work on, I really don't feel like that's been an area that we've had to focus on.\"\n\nThe next step is carrying that production into games.\n\n\"When we get to the Rams game (on Aug. 31), I guarantee we'll throw some screens and you'll be like, 'Oh, that looks like how it should,'\" Taylor said. \"It's really a feel thing. You really have to mess it up a few times to really figure out how to do it.\"\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSEVIDEOS FROM GREEN BAY PACKERS TRAINING CAMP 2017Martellus Bennett: Anthem protests 'courageous' | 1:25\n\nGreen Bay Packers tight end Martellus Bennett talks to the media after training camp practice on Tuesday, August 15, 2017.

(Aug. 16, 2017) USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nGREEN BAY - Kicker Mason Crosby made all six of his field-goal attempts during the Green Bay Packers' practice Wednesday. All six snaps came from veteran Brett Goode.\n\nCoincidence? Correlation? Only the people involved know the answers to those questions. But it goes without saying that Crosby is totally comfortable with Goode as the triggerman on field goals, especially with Goode's ability to put the laces in the right spot on nearly every snap.\n\nThat has been a problem area for long snapper Derek Hart and punter/holder Justin Vogel in camp.\n\n\"We had a few lace issues, laces inside, and I had some balls that just kind of jumped left on me,\" Crosby said last week. \"And that will tend to happen if the laces get thrown inside like that. Those are just little things that we've got to rep out and make sure that everything is in sync and we approach it the right way and we're better on tomorrow's practice and as we move into the game.\"\n\nGoode, on the other hand, snaps the ball in a way that allows the holder to simply catch it and place it on the ground. The laces are already in the correct spot for the majority of snaps. Crosby said it's a unique skill that not every snapper can manage.\n\n\"I didn't know he said that,\" Goode said with a modest smile.\n\nSo how is it done?\n\n\"I don't know,\" Goode said. \"I don't know the answer to that. I just know I'm still working it. I'm still not happy with some of them, still trying to perfect it to get even better.\n\n\"I wouldn't say that I'm perfect at it. There's still constant work that I try to do every day. I don't even know the time frame (of when I learned to do it). It was just one of those things where just a lot of practice and repetition, repetition, repetition.\n\n\"Once you can throw like a really good ball that's consistent, then you can practice on doing other things to make it where you get the laces consistent.\"\n\nMastermind: When outside linebacker Clay Matthews whiffed on an opportunity to sack Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz in the exhibition opener, the play devolved into one of the ugliest highlights a defense can imagine: Star pass rusher misses sack, rookie second-round pick (Kevin King) gets stiff-armed to the ground, No. 2 corner (Quinten Rollins) suffers the same fate as King and wide receiver Mack Hollins winds up in the end zone.\n\nBut Matthews had another take on the situation, one that was equal parts sarcastic and quick-witted. He exonerated himself for missing the tackle because it was all part of a lengthy plan to transfer the Packers' scramble drills from the practice field to an actual game.\n\n\"No, see, I did that on purpose because we work on scramble drills and (quarterback Aaron Rodgers) does it all the time,\" Matthews said jokingly Wednesday. \"And I just, I wanted to let the guys get a look at it, and unfortunately we just weren't ready for it. I mean, that's my bad I guess.\n\n\"Nah, it's true though. We talk about tackling a doughnut (in practice) is different versus tackling a quarterback. But come Week 1 I'll make sure I can get quarterbacks down.\"\n\nStreak snapped: It took 11 practices, but someone finally intercepted quarterback Taysom Hill during team reps.\n\nHill, an undrafted free agent from Brigham Young, receives the fewest snaps of any quarterback, which certainly played a role in his impressive streak. But he was also playing well and caught the eyes of the coaches against the Eagles.\n\n\"I think he did some really good things in the fourth quarter,\" coach Mike McCarthy said.\n\nBut Wednesday was a bit more problematic, and Hill finally joined his three counterparts -- Aaron Rodgers, Brett Hundley, Joe Callahan -- in the interception department.\n\nInside linebacker Cody Heiman caught a tipped ball in the end zone during a red-zone drill late in practice. Then, a few minutes later, Hill had another pass tipped by Kevin King. It fell directly into the arms of inside linebacker Jordan Tripp.\n\nSo far, the unofficial interception totals during team reps are as follows: Hundley with four (plus a fifth against the Eagles), Rodgers with two, Callahan with two and Hill with two.\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSEVIDEOS FROM GREEN BAY PACKERS TRAINING CAMP 2017Aaron Rodgers: Preseason games not realistic | 1:23\n\nGreen Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers talks to the media after training camp practice on August 15, 2017.

Bennett essentially said Adams needed to practice as hard as he played in games. After that nightmare season ended, the light turned on for Adams and it has been evident how far he has come. Adams won't play a lot in the exhibition games, so most of his work is on the scout team. Though he's running other teams' offenses, the routes are similar and he uses the time to work on his craft. \"When we're going out there a lot of it is realistic timing of the routes, so getting out there and getting that timing and that camaraderie it doesn't really matter if it's in a team period or a scout-team period,\" Adams said. In the one-on-one drills with the cornerbacks, Adams has been impressive. He has been giving rookie Kevin King tips on how to play bump coverage, but he has no compunction about leaving him in the dust. In the drill Wednesday, Adams beat King on a stop route, couldn't beat Quinten Rollins on a sideline route and then beat Rollins on a slant. In the team drills, Adams has caught just about everything. From his get-off at the line of scrimmage to his body position on contested throws, he has been impressive in practice. He did have a drop in the Philadelphia game, but Wednesday he ended practice with a leaping catch over cornerback Josh Hawkins in the corner of the end zone.\n\nThumbs down\n\nHawkins is being given every chance in the world to make the team, mostly because he's tough and runs a 4.39-second 40-yard dash. He is holding down positions as a hold-up guy on punt returns and a gunner on punt coverage. His play at cornerback, however, has been disappointing. The second-year undrafted free agent is raw, but his speed and long arms reminded the Packers of Sam Shields, so they have been patient with him. \"He's been up and down,\" cornerback coach Joe Whitt said. \"We're going to give him an opportunity to get more reps. The only way you know if he can play against top-level receivers is to give him an opportunity to go against them.\" This practice provided another example of his inconsistent play. In two match-ups with Randall Cobb in one-on-ones, he gave up too much cushion. In the team drills, he drew an obvious penalty when he held receiver Michael Clark on a corner route and then was out of position on a 2-point conversion. Then on the final play, he failed to maintain position in front of Adams despite having decent coverage on the fade route.\n\nInjury report\n\nThree players were added to the list of those not practicing. Safety Jermaine Whitehead sat out with a hip injury, long snapper Derek Hart was out because of illness and tight end Aaron Peck didn't go because of a neck injury.\n\nIn total, 11 players on the active roster did not participate. The only starters in that group are running back Ty Montgomery (leg) and cornerback Davon House (hamstring).\n\nBits and pieces\n\n\" For some reason, rookie quarterback Taysom Hill threw a pass in the middle of the field that was caught well short of the end zone during a 2-minute drill. There were eight seconds left on the clock when the play began and the offense had no timeouts.\n\n\" It appeared nose tackle Brian Price was going to lose his one-on-one pass rush match-up with guard Geoff Gray, but at the last second he pushed the 315-pound linemen away like he was an inflatable clown.\n\n\" Rookie corner Raysean Pringle stole the ball right out of receiver Trevor Davis' arms on a deep sideline route in the one-on-ones. One second Davis had it and the next Pringle did.\n\n\" Rookie tackle Robert Leff got a thrill while on the scout team that was running Washington's offense. He was a tackle eligible and had the ball thrown to him in the end zone. He dropped it.\n\n\" Quarterback Aaron Rodgers decided to spice things up late in the 2-hour, 35-minute practice, taunting the defense with cries of \"All day\", following his last completion.\n\n\" Defensive line coach Mike Trgovac was furious with his position group after the offense blasted open several huge holes during the physical 9-on-7 run drill.\n\n\" Outside linebacker Kyler Fackrell won his first one-on-one pass rush drill of training camp, slipping past Leff for the win.\n\nQuote of the day\n\n\"I haven't seen him. I've seen his dunk tape, and that was pretty impressive, but I haven't seen him hooping yet. I'm sure we'll see it next offseason.\" - Adams on 6-6 wide receiver Michael Clark, who played basketball for one year at St. Francis (Pa.) before switching to football.\n\nPractice schedule\n\nThe Packers play Washington at 6:30 p.m. Saturday at FedEx Field. The next practice open to the public is Tuesday at 12:15 p.m.\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSEVIDEOS FROM GREEN BAY PACKERS TRAINING CAMP 2017Takeaways from Packers practice: Aug. 16 | 2:22\n\nPete Dougherty and Aaron Nagler try to read the tea leaves on what Mike McCarthy's plans are for Aaron Rodgers and look at an embarrassing backup QB moment.

All of a sudden, Gunter is climbing out of the hole.\n\n\"I let a couple of plays get away from me,\" Gunter said of his poor start. \"For the most part I stuck with what I was doing, watched the film and saw I was kind of off my technique and those sort of things.\n\n\"So, I was kind of correcting myself all the way leading up to this past week.\"\n\nThe 6-2, 201-pound Gunter played much better against Philadelphia, causing and recovering one of the five fumbles the Eagles had. In practice this week, his play has been better.\n\nOn Wednesday, he deflected a pass into the end zone that teammate Cody Heiman picked off. In the one-on-ones he blanketed receiver Geronimo Allison on one incompletion and covered up Jeff Janis on a fade route.\n\nThe slot position wouldn't seem ideal for Gunter because of his lack of speed, but it actually might be better because he has the size and willingness to tackle, to play the run and blitz the quarterback. He's still fighting for a roster spot, but he's no longer buried on the depth chart.\n\n\"I feel like I can get the ball a little bit,\" Gunter said of playing inside. \"I played with a lot of confidence inside. Just getting a feel for it, getting back to the groove. I hadn't been there for a while. I just need to keep improving.\"\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSEVIDEOS FROM GREEN BAY PACKERS TRAINING CAMP 2017Takeaways from Packers practice: Aug. 16 | 2:22\n\nPete Dougherty and Aaron Nagler try to read the tea leaves on what Mike McCarthy's plans are for Aaron Rodgers and look at an embarrassing backup QB moment.

USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nGREEN BAY - It was only by chance that the Green Bay Packers found out Justin McCray was in the best physical shape of his life, so why not give him a chance?\n\nA year ago, McCray had just finished his one and only season playing for the Orlando Predators of the Arena Football League and was working at a hotel run by the team's owner, hoping to get one more shot at the NFL.\n\nHe and his twin brother, Jordan, who was in the Packers' training camp in 2014 and spent a short time on their practice squad later in the season, were training like mad men, looking to catch somebody's eye.\n\nDOUGHERTY: Packers can't afford to play tag with Aaron Rodgers' contract\n\nRELATED: Ty Montgomery held out of practice with injury\n\nThey didn't have an in, so they asked if they could get a re-do at Central Florida's pro day, which they had attended three years earlier after their senior seasons. The football staff agreed to let them test in front of the scouts, although they were not allowed to do any football drills.\n\n\"We were in great shape obviously, just eating right and training all that time,\" McCray said. \"I went there and ran a lot better than I did coming out of college. I ran a 5.5 (seconds in the 40-yard dash) at my pro day and I ran 5.11 this time.\"\n\nIt just so happened that Packers senior personnel executive Alonzo Highsmith was in attendance and liked what he saw. Highsmith went home and told general manager Ted Thompson about it. The following Sunday, McCray received a phone call from his agent while at church. He took the call and found out the Packers wanted to work him out.\n\nMcCray flew to town, worked out and was signed on the spot, despite the fact he had sat out the entire 2016 season.\n\n\"The last time I had put on pads was last August,\" McCray said.\n\nLuckily for him, he had time to get comfortable with the Packers' system through the off-season program. So when he reported for training camp, he was prepared to let his 6-3, 317-pound body do the talking.\n\nFrom the start, McCray, who had posted an impressive 32 reps on the bench press during his senior pro day, has played to the whistle. It has gotten him involved in some skirmishes, including one in which safety Kentrell Brice took a wild swing at him, but his teammates have come to respect his ability.\n\n\"He's really strong, you can tell that,\" guard Lane Taylor said. \"He plays with a lot of power.\"\n\nSince joining the Packers, McCray has done a whole lot more than just put on the pads. He has held down the No. 2 job at right guard, the No. 3 job at center and a first-team position on the kickoff-return unit.\n\nIf you don't think those are important positions, then consider that with JC Tretter gone to Cleveland in free agency, Don Barclay and Jason Spriggs, a pair of natural tackles, came into camp as the only backup guard prospects likely to make the team.\n\nNow with Barclay (ankle) sidelined indefinitely, McCray's strong performance in the first two weeks of camp and against the Philadelphia Eagles in the exhibition opener has vaulted him in position to make the team as a backup at three positions.\n\n\"I'm older but still young when it comes to game experience,\" McCray, 25, said. \"I definitely try to not have too much of an ego and learn from them (the veterans) while incorporating some of the things I've learned along the way.\"\n\nIt helps that the Packers knew what they were getting with McCray. Back in '14, they wanted to sign him and Jordan to rookie free-agent contracts.\n\nBut the two decided they needed to split up for the first time in their lives. Jordan chose to sign with the Packers and Justin signed with the Tennessee Titans.\n\nNeither twin made his respective team, although both were signed to the practice squads. The Packers cut Jordan after a short time and didn't re-sign Justin when the Titans let him go in 2015.\n\n\"It was a good experience,\" McCray said. \"We still got to play against each other. My first NFL game was against Jordan when Tennessee played against Green Bay (in the 2014 exhibition season). It was definitely a cool thing. The family got to see both of us play.\"\n\nPlaying in the Packers' system is a lot different than playing Arena ball, but McCray said he learned to play in space and feels it has helped him use his hands better. The most stressful part came when the coaches asked him to play center, but he hasn't had many bad snaps and seems to be stout in pass protection.\n\nIt's fortunate for the Packers, too, because rookie guard Kofi Amichia hasn't taken to playing center and free agent Lucas Patrick also is a guard learning center. McCray isn't a lock to make the team, but he's giving the Packers something to think about.\n\n\"The more you can do,\" McCray said. \"There's a lot of competition because Lucas (Patrick) is a really good guard-center, Donnie can do it, Kofi (Amichia) can do it as well. And then guys that are already there starting.\n\n\"It's really good competition. It's good for us because we're competing against each other. Competition breeds success.\"\n\nAnd McCray is competing better than anyone expected.\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSEVIDEOS FROM GREEN BAY PACKERS TRAINING CAMP 2017Martellus Bennett: Anthem protests 'courageous' | 1:25\n\nGreen Bay Packers tight end Martellus Bennett talks to the media after training camp practice on Tuesday, August 15, 2017.

Before the Packers' exhibition opener - this year it was before the Family Night practice, McCarthy said - players are taught the national anthem's meaning. They learn about its connection with sports, why it has been played before kickoffs and tip-offs and first pitches and puck drops since World War II.\n\nMcCarthy's message hasn't changed, left guard Lane Taylor said, even as something that once was an automated part of the NFL's pregame process has become anything but routine.\n\nDOUGHERTY: Packers can't afford to play tag with Aaron Rodgers' contract\n\nRELATED: Max McCaffrey making WR decision difficult for Packers\n\nRELATED: Download our PackersNews app for iOS or Android\n\n\"He just tells you to put your hand over your heart,\" Taylor said. \"I think he says it's something he appreciates and stuff. I think it's been pretty standard, and I know it's a big subject nowadays, but he hasn't changed the way he presents it to us or anything.\"\n\nProtests started in the NFL last year when Kaepernick, then the San Francisco 49ers' quarterback, sat through the national anthem before a preseason game against the Packers. Kaepernick said his demonstration was meant to protest racial inequality and police brutality.\n\nThe movement continues throughout the league one year later.\n\nBefore the Oakland Raiders' exhibition opener last week, running back Marshawn Lynch sat on a bench as the national anthem played. Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle Michael Bennett sat on a bench through the national anthem before kickoff against the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nBennett's demonstration provided the closest connection to the Packers since Kaepernick started the trend of sitting or kneeling last preseason. Tight end Martellus Bennett, Michael's younger brother, is new to the Packers' locker room this season.\n\nMartellus Bennett said this week he supports his brother's decision to protest. He added he wasn't planning to sit through the national anthem Saturday when the Packers play their second exhibition in the nation's capital. The Packers' trip to Washington comes in the aftermath of violence at white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville, Va., last weekend.\n\nCornerback Davon House was asked Thursday how he thought protesting during the national anthem would be received in Green Bay.\n\n\"That's a dangerous question I'm going to avoid right now,\" House said after pausing to consider his words carefully.\n\nHis answer exemplified the protest's potentially nuclear nature. Players cautiously approach the topic, and for good reason. Kaepernick remains unemployed despite almost universal belief he's talented enough at age 29 to merit an invitation to a team's training camp. With no Packers players having protested, it's unknown how the team's hierarchy would react.\n\nGeneral manager Ted Thompson said Thursday he is able to separate his personal preference from expectations on how his players should conduct themselves during the national anthem.\n\n\"I view this as something you're asking me from a personal standpoint,\" Thompson said. \"Not what I would do, but what I would feel about a particular player if he made such and such action, or if he failed to make such and such action. This is a free country in my opinion, and free people can do what they like.\"\n\nDefensive tackle Ricky Jean Francois said he never has considered not standing during the national anthem.\n\n\"It's a waste of time,\" Jean Francois said. \"It's a waste of my energy. I understand it may help, but tell me what's going to help right now with what's going on in the country. Nothing, really. At the end of the day, the only people I can help is my wife, my kids, my family - and that's it. I understand we're trying to get a point across, but is that point really getting across right now, or is it making more mayhem?\n\n\"So at the end of the day, you just want to back off and be like, 'Man, forget it. In due time it'll take care of itself, hopefully.' If it doesn't, I just have to make sure my family and my child and other people around me (are) well aware of what's going on, and just got to be safe.\"\n\nThe Packers aren't the only NFL team that discusses national-anthem decorum during training camp.\n\nHouse, who played the past two seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars, said his former team regimented anthem decorum. In Jacksonville, House said, players were told to place their helmet across their chest, behind the back or under their right arm.\n\n\"It's kind of the exact same thing\" as McCarthy's presentation, House said. \"It shows an overview picture of how guys are standing up, and overview of everyone standing in a line.\"\n\nYet not every team addresses anthem decorum with a presentation. Jean Francois, who is playing with his fourth NFL team, said McCarthy's presentation was the first he has seen.\n\nJean Francois saw protests firsthand last season when he played with Washington. Before a September game at the New York Giants, Washington receivers Desean Jackson and Rashad Ross, tight end Niles Paul and cornerback Greg Toler raised their fists during the national anthem.\n\nOne week later, Washington planned to honor military branches at a home game. Jean Francois said players had a team meeting with president Bruce Allen.\n\n\"In so many words,\" Jean Francois said, \"he wanted it to stop. Because you've got to realize we're in the nation's capital, we're around military. We're around every branch of the military, and just to do that, it's going to seem disrespectful.\"\n\nBefore Washington's game that afternoon against the Cleveland Browns, Jackson, the most visible player among the quartet, wore custom cleats with caution tape to protest police brutality. He did not protest through the national anthem.\n\nJean Francois said any player can choose whether to protest, but they must understand potential consequences.\n\nCoincidence or not, of the four Washington players who protested early last season, three are no longer with the team.\n\n\"Some of our players made the choice,\" Jean Francois said. \"They had to deal with the consequences.\"\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type":

(Aug. 10, 2017) USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nTed Thompson has one player he absolutely needs to sign to a new contract within the next year.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers general manager has been proactive on Aaron Rodgers' contract in the past, and there's no reason to think he won't be again. But really, it's a must that he signs his quarterback to what will be a record-setting extension by next spring or summer.\n\nRodgers has three years left on his current deal, including this season, so you might be wondering why the hurry?\n\nHere's why: The franchise tag ain't what it used to be, and for players, it's now more blessing than curse.\n\nRELATED: Rodgers hope to play until 40 with Packers\n\nRELATED: With Rodgers on a roll, Packers fueled for more fireworks\n\nThat means the Packers shouldn't let Rodgers get anywhere near the final year (2019) of his current deal. They don't want the tag in play.\n\nLet's start with where things stand. Rodgers, 33, is the second-best quarterback in the game, and the Packers are perennial Super Bowl contenders because of him. They aren't letting him go anywhere. So in that way, the franchise tag is their ultimate safety net.\n\nBut it comes with a steep price that's a product of the 2011 CBA. Players used to hate the tag, but now, not so much. Especially quarterbacks. Kirk Cousins, who will have made $43.9 million playing on Washington's tag in 2016 and '17, has shown the way.\n\nThe price isn't just the high cost of the tag, which is the average of the top five players at a position. It's the even higher escalators for using it multiple times on the same guy.\n\nFor example, let's say Rodgers' contract was up and the Packers tagged him for the first time this year. He'd make $21.68 million. To tag him again next year, they'd have to give him a 20 percent raise ($25.521 million). And to tag him a third time -- that's the maximum allowed per player -- they'd have to offer a 44 percent raise over that, or $36.751 million.\n\nSo three years of tags would cost $83.5 million. And that's at today's prices. The tag will be higher in 2020, when Rodgers would be a free agent. By then it easily could be $25 million, perhaps more. For three years of tags, you're talking at least $100 million.\n\nIf Rodgers gets close to even a whiff of free agency, then that's where his contract talks will start: $100 million fully guaranteed. He'll know all he has to do is get to 2020, when he'll be 36, and he's in for a windfall.\n\nDon't let that age, 36, fool you. For top quarterbacks, it's not that old. The rules protect them, and sports scientists are learning more about longevity every year. Tom Brady, recently turned 40, has played some of his best football the last couple years. Drew Brees at 38 remains a premier player. Chances are, Rodgers still will be playing well even as he closes in on the big 4-0.\n\nSo when will Rodgers start getting a whiff of the tag? I'd say next fall. By then he'll be only two years from free agency. If I'm him, that's when I start baking the tag into contract talks. Because all he has to do is get within a year of free agency and it's game over. All the leverage will be his.\n\nBut if the Packers get serious in the next 12 months, they can keep the tag out of it. Then the parameters will be recent quarterback deals, like Derek Carr's five-year extension this offseason. Carr's contract averages $25 million in new money and includes $40 million in full guarantees. Andrew Luck had $47 million in full guarantees with the deal he signed in 2016.\n\nAnd Matthew Stafford should be the next big contract to drop. He's in the last year of his deal, though he and the Detroit Lions are having trouble working out a new one. The Lions, no doubt, are running into the franchise-tag problems the Packers need to avoid.\n\nI doubt Thompson and team vice president Russ Ball will start talks with Rodgers this season, though that wouldn't be the worst idea. But I'll be stunned if they haven't worked out something with him by next spring or summer.\n\nRodgers says he wants to finish his career with the Packers, and there's no reason to doubt him. He could have wrung more money out of them in 2013 but seemed to decide that past a certain point ($22 million average in new money) it would get counterproductive.\n\nTo be sure, Rodgers' next deal will come with a steep price. It's one any team would pay. But if the Packers wait too long, then they'll really find out what expensive is.\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSEVIDEOS FROM GREEN BAY PACKERS TRAINING CAMP 2017Aaron Nagler's training camp chat: Aug. 14 | 22:17\n\nAaron Nagler talks training camp and all things Packers in a Facebook Live chat with our followers.

He is the embodiment of Packers stability.\n\nBoth lists exclude the two owners who act as their own GMs (Dallas' Jerry Jones and Cincinnati's Mike Brown). No one can fire them.\n\nThompson, on the other hand, answers to Mark Murphy, the team's president and CEO. Thompson's contract runs through the end of the 2018 season, but he has given no indication he's planning on retiring then. And much like former Packers CEO Bob Harlan's stance with former GM Ron Wolf, Murphy has said essentially that the job is Thompson's as long as he wants it.\n\nDOUGHERTY: Packers can't afford to play tag with Aaron Rodgers' contract\n\nRELATED: Max McCaffrey making WR decision difficult for Packers\n\nRELATED: Download our PackersNews app for iOS or Android\n\nThompson indisputably has fielded winning teams: His .617 regular-season winning percentage is fourth-best in the league over his tenure, behind New England (.771), Indianapolis (.656) and Pittsburgh (.635).\n\nThe Packers also are 10-8 in the playoffs under Thompson and have won one Super Bowl, in the 2010 season. If they qualify for the playoffs this year, they will tie the NFL record for consecutive seasons in postseason play (nine).\n\nThat's also the rub. The quarterback Thompson selected with his first draft pick as Packers GM, Aaron Rodgers in 2005, is a sure-fire Pro Football Hall of Famer. And for all the winning that selection has brought, the Packers have been to the Super Bowl only once in the Rodgers era, and it has been six years since that championship.\n\nThat's why Thompson's future as GM has become an issue with his staunchest critics. Has he been doing enough to give the Packers their best chance? And is he still up to the demands of his high-pressure job as he approaches that landmark age of 65?\n\nThompson surely is among the least-quoted and most media-averse GMs in the NFL, but this week he agreed to a one-on-one interview that lasted 16 1/2 minutes. In it he discussed his health, his work duties, and some of his moves in building this year's team.\n\nQ: Mark Murphy has said essentially that the GM job is yours as long as you want it. You give no indication of when you're thinking you'll want to retire. For the record, you're 64 and the fourth-oldest GM in the NFL. Three of the four GMs hired this offseason were 37, 40 and 47, and the other was hired as an interim GM. Like many businesses, yours skews relatively young. How's your health and stamina?\n\nA: I feel good. I'm aware of those kind of statistics, but Mark's thing is, as long as I'm doing my job, as long as I feel good about doing it, as long as I get along with my co-workers, that sort of thing, then what's the point of that? In this day and age, people are doing things longer and better because of the knowledge we have, the diets we have, the things we take into our body that are good for you or bad for you. But without getting on a preaching thing, yeah, I feel good.\n\nQ: You used to run a lot to stay fit. Do you still, or have you had to stop since undergoing hip replacement surgery in 2014?\n\nA: No. I had left-knee cartilage surgery when I was playing (in the NFL). Over time you lose some of your bounce. The doctors have told me I'm perfectly fine to walk and things like that, but there's no reason to add the pounding of jogging. I used to jog a lot after I got done playing - the Blue Bell Fun Run in Brenham, Texas. But I don't jog anymore because of that. I ride my bicycle in the summertime quite a bit, didn't ride it as much this year. Been staying in reasonably good shape. I lift weights. I'm usually here early in the morning, one of those guys. Lift and do mobile stuff and flexibility stuff. We have good people that advise us.\n\nQ: You're on the road scouting college players for most of the regular season. Do you still enjoy that grind? Do you want to cut back and let your lieutenants handle more of that?\n\nA: If you went by my schedule now as opposed to my schedule six or seven years ago, it would be pared back a little bit, for a couple reasons. No. 1, I thought it was more important in some cases for me to be more available here during the course of the season. Which meant maybe instead of not leaving on Monday night I'd leave on Tuesday night, something like that. No. 2, it just felt like it was time. I still get out and scout. I enjoy it. But we have a remarkable group of people in our personnel department, and it's good to see them get out and put their name on a report or a scouting trip. When you have to put pen to paper, or typewriter to paper, however you call that, and say a guy is a first-round player or a third-round player, and differentiate between that, that's a great teaching thing. So we like to get our guys out, even our pro guys, as much as we can.\n\nQ: How many weeks are you on the road during the season?\n\nA: Some portions of it, probably all of them. But I might drive from here to Iowa, visit Iowa for a couple days and come back. Or on the way back stop in Madison and do (Wisconsin) so I'd have a trip of Iowa and Madison. There are weeks when I have one school, there are weeks when I have a couple schools. And if I'm feeling frisky I might do three, on a bye or something.\n\nQ: How much non-football administrative work do you still do? How much have you been able to farm out to Russ Ball, your vice president of football administration/player finance?\n\nA: I wouldn't call it farm out. When we first were able to get Russ here we set up a system so he was going to be in charge of some of the administrative stuff, most of the classic administrative stuff. Also within this organization there are certain things that come to me that I have to answer for or I have to make a decision on. Russ and I work together on those things, and he represents me at senior staff meetings - there's a senior staff meeting going on right now. Everybody knows that, so it's not that big a story. He does a great job of that, but I don't take advantage of that, and I'm always involved in the decision itself, in that he and I are going to talk about it, whether it's on the phone if I'm out scouting, or whether it's here in the office because we can get together and talk about it before we decide on what's the best way to go about it. But we always weigh in.\n\nQ: Your contract expires after the 2018 season. Have you and Murphy talked about extending it? Do you want an extension?\n\nA: I don't think I've ever talked about that, and I don't think I'm going to start. We'll just leave it at that. It was a good try.\n\nQ: If Murphy knows he wants one of your subordinates to be the next GM whenever you retire, and that guy gets a job offer from another team before you retire, what do you do? Would you feel obliged to step aside or take a different role so he could move up? Or is it up to the organization to secure that person until you retire?\n\nA: This is purely hypothetical and I'm not sure how I would respond to that. I don't think you can worry about what-ifs. You have to do your job that it is today. And today my job is this. It's not speculating on something that might happen in three years, or something like that.\n\nQ: At this year's shareholders meeting Murphy acknowledged hearing from fans who think the franchise has failed by winning only one Super Bowl so far with a quarterback who's a future Pro Football Hall of Famer. Let's acknowledge that winning a Super Bowl is very difficult. But with how important quarterbacks are and how good Rodgers is, is there merit to their criticism?\n\nA: I think we all feel that way, that we're disappointed that we haven't done that, not just because of Aaron, but because of this team. It's a tight organization, people care about each other, even those of us that aren't directly involved in football or into the football thing. So it hurts when we don't get to do what we want to do, which is win the Super Bowl. I think I said this at the (NFL scouting) combine, we're not dodging this, that's what we want to do, we want to try to win.\n\nQ: You were more active in free agency last offseason than in the past. (He signed four significant players: tight ends Martellus Bennett and Lance Kendricks, cornerback Davon House and guard Jahri Evans). What changed your thinking? Did Mike McCarthy influence you there? Your scouts?\n\nA: Organizationally, I don't know that we felt any change or anything. We went about our business the same as we always do. Opportunities to do things were more prevalent maybe than in the past. We've always said we're going to take advantage, and any way we can get better we're going to try to get better. In this year's case we thought there were more opportunities to do that.\n\nQ: Last year your team recovered from a 4-6 start to advance to the NFC Championship game, only to get beaten badly by Atlanta. What did you learn from that performance that you applied to putting together your team in the offseason?\n\nA: I don't think there was any one thing specifically. It's a reminder of how difficult it is to accomplish this. It's not like fantasy football. This is real stuff. You have real people and real competitors and real athletes all trying to get to the same place you are. When you slip up and have a bad day, that reminds you even more so, painfully so, it's hard to do.\n\nQ: Along those lines, you signed a starting cornerback in free agency (House) and selected defensive backs with your first two draft picks (Kevin King and Josh Jones). Why the heavy emphasis on coverage over other areas?\n\nA: I think we always have a heavy emphasis there. We're very keen on defensive backs and their ability to help you play the game in the National Football League. I don't think our attitude toward that position has ever changed.\n\nQ: On the flip side, the pass rush is commonly considered the best way to defend top quarterbacks. Your two best rushers (Clay Matthews and Nick Perry) have had nearly annual injury issues, and one of them (Matthews) is on the wrong side of 30. The most prominent addition to your rush was a fourth-round draft pick (Vince Biegel). Why not use a higher pick or more resources at that position?\n\nA: First of all, I think our ability to put pressure on the quarterback is being a little bit underrated there based on that question. Secondly, during the draft you take the best players you can take. That's the way it worked out. We don't ever change from that.\n\nQ: in the last six years, since winning the Super Bowl in the 2010 season, your defense hasn't finished in the top 10 in either points allowed or yards allowed. Why has that side of the ball been an issue for so long? What's going on there?\n\nA: I don't think anything is going on. This is a difficult business altogether, No. 1 just to simply play the game and line up with a jersey number, it's hard to play. And to do it well is really, really hard. And to do it really well on defense, when you don't know what the other team is doing, is impossibly hard.\n\nQ: As far as media responsibilities, you do only the bare minimum required of an NFL GM. Why? With the Packers' public ownership structure, do you ever think, or has anyone you work with ever suggested, that you have an obligation to communicate more often with the team's fans via the media? Can't you convey your thinking more often without betraying state secrets?\n\nA: No, I've never heard that. What I think is important for the Green Bay Packers is for me to make sure I represent the Green Bay Packers well. Which means working as an honest person with integrity. For me to do a whole bunch of press conferences and things like that, put it out in public, when that's not my cup of tea, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\n\nQ: Do you ever talk with Mike McCarthy about this? Does he agree? Doesn't this approach put more on him to take all the heat when things aren't going well, such as last season's 4-6 start?\n\nA: Mike handles himself very well. He always does a good job. Nobody's not - we all can see, we all have vision, and we understand when things are in a tough spot and when they're not in a tough spot. I just don't agree with the substance of your question.\n\nQ: We have time for a final question: Your team is now through the most competitive portion of training camp practices - the first two weeks - and has played one preseason game. What do you think of your club?\n\nA: I like it. I think we've got a shot.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United

We've got the guys to do it, we've got the guys who can cover, too.\n\n\"Whatever Dom calls, that's what we run.\"\n\nCapers used the first half, when most of his starters and key backups were in the game, to run an array of blitzes featuring linebackers, safeties and cornerbacks. In the first quarter, he rushed more than four guys on every pass attempt but one.\n\nIn the first quarter, there were two six-man pressures with an inside linebacker and slot corner added to the rush. There were two five-man rushes with just the slot corner blitzing. There was one with a safety and inside linebacker blitzing.\n\nLater in the second quarter, two cornerbacks and an inside linebacker on a six-man rush.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" said veteran defensive lineman Ricky Jean Francois, who is on his fourth team and has seen primarily bland game plans in August everywhere he's been. \"But I think he wanted to see different blitzes from different looks. We get a lot in practice, but he wanted to see it in real, live-game experience, see what our reaction was, see how we'll match up, the audibles, checking anything out of those blitzes.\n\n\"That was something new for me to actually do.\"\n\nThe notion that the Packers are using blitzes they might employ against Seattle would be anathema in most NFL circles, but Capers decided this summer he wanted his defense to practice them under game-like conditions.\n\nIn 2014, Capers came up with a 4-3 look he wanted to spring on the Seahawks in a season opener in Seattle. He kept it a secret from the rest of the NFL, using it only in the privacy of the Packers' practice fields.\n\nThe Seahawks destroyed it, and while it turned out to be a poorly conceived idea, the Packers might have been better at it if they had tested it out in a game. Or maybe they would have realized it wasn't going to work.\n\nThis year, Capers, who has a revamped secondary that has many new pieces and moving parts, has decided he needs the live action to test out his plan. He is using the August games to create an identity for his defense and set the tone for the regular season.\n\nAs for tipping his hand, Capers isn't worried about that.\n\n\"Sometimes, you can get too caught up in that,\" Capers said earlier in training camp. \"I think we've got to continue to work toward what we're going to be and focus in on what we do and technique and those types of things.\n\n\"You don't want to be doing it by trial and error once you get into the regular season. You want to feel pretty confident. You don't want to go out and play outstanding for 58 out of 60 plays and have two plays make the difference in the game.\"\n\nRELATED: King shows grit, composure through inconsistent debut\n\nRELATED: Packers looking to Clark, Lowry for inside pass rush\n\nIt's very likely Capers won't blitz nearly as often as he did against the Eagles once the regular season rolls around.\n\nBut a couple of things have been evident throughout training camp. The Packers are going to use a lot of press-man coverage with their tall, long-armed cornerbacks and they're going to try to keep pressure on quarterbacks.\n\nTo that end, Capers has not hidden his \"nitro\" scheme, which replaces an inside linebacker with a safety in the nickel (five defensive backs) package. It means there will be six defensive backs on the field, but one will play near the line of scrimmage and be able to blitz or play coverage.\n\nIt's going to have to be used on passing downs because teams will just run it at them and force the safety, either Morgan Burnett or rookie Josh Jones, to take on linemen that weigh 100 pounds more than them.\n\nRegardless of when it's used, the nitro scheme needs to be practiced and Capers ran it often against the Eagles and probably will run a lot of it against Washington on Saturday night.\n\n\"I think we're in the mindset that it doesn't matter if a team knows what we're doing,\" inside linebacker Blake Martinez said. \"As long as we execute and get the job done we won't be stopped.\"\n\nThe general consensus after the Eagles game was that the blitzing turned the tempo of the game in the Packers' favor, but the execution of the blitzes and nitro package could have been a lot better. The defense finished with just one sack and one quarterback knockdown.\n\nThere were four turnovers forced, but some of the coordination and timing needs to improve. That was especially the case with the nitro package.\n\n\"As much as we did pressure, you would have loved to see more production,\" inside linebackers coach Scott McCurley said. \"Based on what we ended up doing and how we sped up the time clock of the offense, I think we got something accomplished in that regard.\n\n\"Just going back and looking at the tape, we talked about it in there, some different things we can do. Maybe be a little cleaner on some one-on-ones, clean up our timing, clean up our disguise and do some things better there.\"\n\nOne thing is for sure, the coaches won't have any hesitation working all that stuff out in games.\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSEVIDEOS FROM GREEN BAY PACKERS TRAINING CAMP 2017McCarthy sees Rodgers-Bennett chemistry | 1:03\n\nGreen Bay Packers coach Mike McCarthy spoke on Aaron Rodgers and Martellus Bennett building their chemistry throughout the offseason and into camp.

(Aug. 16, 2017) USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nGREEN BAY - If you were charting all the receptions during Green Bay Packers' training camp, the leader wouldn't be Jordy Nelson or Randall Cobb or Davante Adams.\n\nIt likely would be Max McCaffrey.\n\n\"Every day in practice he's making plays,\" quarterback Aaron Rodgers said.\n\nLast training camp it was Geronimo Allison who emerged out of a group of young receivers and earned Rodgers' attention. Allison didn't make the final cut, but he was signed to the practice squad and then elevated to the 53-man roster in Week 8.\n\nDOUGHERTY: Packers can't afford to play tag with Aaron Rodgers' contract\n\nDownload our PackersNews app for iOS or Android\n\nThe 6-2, 200-pound McCaffrey has the bloodlines to be an NFL player, but he has been forced to enter through a side door, not through the first round like his brother, Christian, or the third round like his father, Ed.\n\nMax wasn't drafted coming out of Duke in 2016. He signed with Oakland and took part in their training camp but was released on the cutdown to 75.\n\nHe went almost the entire rest of the year out of football until the Packers called and signed him to their practice squad Dec. 20. They saw enough of him in the next four weeks to sign him to the 53-man roster as an emergency option for the NFC Championship game.\n\nThough McCaffrey was inactive, he made an impression.\n\nThe only problem was it wasn't big enough to keep general manager Ted Thompson from drafting receivers DeAngelo Yancey in the fifth round and Malachi Dupre in the seventh. Given that Nelson, Cobb and Adams are fixtures, Allison would have to play himself out of a job and Jeff Janis is too valuable on special teams to cut him, McCaffrey faces a tall task.\n\n\"It's always tough not to think about that stuff, but at this point, while I'm here, I'm here,\" McCaffrey said. \"You kind of do your job and that's the reality. I know what my job is and I try to go out and be the best I can at it.\"\n\nThe toughest challenge for McCaffrey has been adapting to a pro-style offense. In Duke coach David Cutliffe's spread scheme, there aren't options for each route based on the defensive coverage.\n\nAs McCaffrey put it, it was about running to a spot on the field as fast as you can.\n\n\"Here it's a lot slower paced and you want to really focus on your route running during the route,\" McCaffrey said. \"So adjusting to that pro style was tough at first, but I'm just trying to improve each day.\"\n\nHe does have a pretty good resource in his father Ed, who caught 565 passes for 7,422 yards and 55 touchdowns during a 13-year career that included stops with the New York Giants, San Francisco 49ers and Denver Broncos.\n\nHis brother, Christian, a Heisman Trophy runner-up at Stanford last year and now a member of the Carolina Panthers, makes a good training partner, too.\n\nBut during the offseason, McCaffrey went to someone he was sure knew the offense and was open to helping young receivers. Coaches can't have contact with their players during the dead periods in the offseason, so McCaffrey asked Adams to help him learn the finer details of the offense.\n\n\"His willingness to learn is the biggest thing,\" Adams said. \"He's texting me, asking me to send him clips from last year, releases (ways to get off the line of scrimmage) and things like that. He's just a student of the game.\n\n\"And you can see it really means a lot to him out there, and the details are refined in what he's been doing. If he keeps that up, he's going to put himself in pretty good position.\"\n\nPractice Wednesday was a pretty typical one for McCaffrey.\n\nIn the one-on-one drills, he beat rookie Donatello Brown on an in-route on his first turn and then followed it up with a double move on his second turn that caused Brown to almost stop in his tracks and McCaffrey to fly by for what would have been a long touchdown in a game.\n\n\"We've been running a lot of moves similar to that so we were trying to fake a different route on that one,\" McCaffrey said, downplaying the move. \"A lot of it is just game tape and learning when DBs are going to bite on which routes.\n\n\"And we play with these guys all the time so it's nice to know their tendencies.\"\n\nThe rest of the practice, McCaffrey did what he usually does. He caught a first-down pass in front of rookie cornerback Kevin King and another first-down toss in the flat from quarterback Joe Callahan. In the 2-minute drill, he caught an 11-yard pass from Taysom Hill.\n\nIf he's had a drop during training camp, it wasn't obvious. His hands have been like glue. He caught only three of the seven balls thrown his way against Philadelphia a week ago, but one was for a 34-yard gain and another for 14 yards.\n\nMcCaffrey's going to have a hard time beating out Allison, the speedy Trevor Davis and the physical Yancey for a roster spot. His speed is good (4.46 seconds in the 40-yard dash), but his strength isn't (nine reps on the bench at his pro day).\n\n\"I'm not worried about it,\" McCaffrey said. \"That's down the road. I take it day to day. And I'm on the Green Bay Packers. I love being here. I'm just trying to help this team.\"\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSEVIDEOS FROM GREEN BAY PACKERS TRAINING CAMP 2017Takeaways from Packers practice: Aug. 16 | 2:22\n\nPete Dougherty and Aaron Nagler try to read the tea leaves on what Mike McCarthy's plans are for Aaron Rodgers and look at an embarrassing backup QB moment.

This was an unfamiliar scene, Evans standing off to the side while his teammates practiced combination blocks. Since arriving this spring, the Green Bay Packers right guard has missed very few reps. Evans' work ethic, maybe before anything else, was what impressed his new team.\n\nEarly in camp, offensive line coach James Campen asked Evans if he wanted a breather. The 12th-year pro turns 34 next week. In a league that abides seniority, on a team that respects experience, Evans' four All-Pro selections means he can have as much rest in camp as he needs.\n\nEvans shrugged off his position coach.\n\n\"I said, 'I might try to take some reps off you,'\" Campen recalled. \"He said, 'Coach, I'm a worker. You do what you think you need to do.' I said, 'OK.' Then you go see Bryan (Bulaga). Bryan's like, 'No, I want to get work with him.'\n\n\"So he hasn't had very many reps off.\"\n\nThen his right cleat ripped Wednesday.\n\nEvans stepped hard - but not that hard - with his right foot while mimicking a combination block beside center Corey Linsley. The sole on his right cleat tore away from the shoe, like two paddles clacking against each other. Evans stood there bemused watching the drill for about 10 minutes while trainers retrieved a new pair of size 16 Nikes before rejoining practice.\n\nDOUGHERTY: Packers can't afford to play tag with Aaron Rodgers' contract\n\nRELATED: Max McCaffrey making WR decision difficult for Packers\n\nDownload our PackersNews app for iOS or Android\n\n\"I'm a big sweater,\" Evans reasoned back at his locker after practice. \"So it probably just loosened up the glue, and trying to dry them, it just gave out.\"\n\nThere's a reason Evans hasn't missed many snaps. His plate is full this summer, adjusting to a new playbook, new offensive line, new quarterback. On what was among the NFL's top pass-blocking units last season, Evans is a wild card.\n\nHow well he replaces departed Pro Bowl right guard T.J. Lang will go a long way to deciding whether the Packers' offensive line will be among the league's best units again.\n\nEvans hasn't handled much change in his career. He was drafted in the fourth round 11 years ago, joining the New Orleans Saints the same year they altered the course of their franchise by signing quarterback Drew Brees. Evans participated in the Seattle Seahawks training camp last August, but was released.\n\nOtherwise, Evans spent each of his 11 seasons with the Saints. In that time, he played beside two starting right tackles: Jon Stinchcomb and Zach Strief. In 169 career games, Brees was his quarterback 168 times.\n\nBulaga, the third starting right tackle in Evans' career, has played beside only two starting guards in his six seasons: Lang and Josh Sitton.\n\n\"You get used to a way one guy plays,\" Bulaga said, \"and when you're used to that, then you come and play next to a new guy, you have to change things up a little bit, try to accommodate each other. You've got to meet in the middle a little bit.\"\n\nIn Evans' first practices with the Packers, Campen said the veteran guard made it clear he wanted to be coached, rather than resting on his reputation. Evans spent a career using certain techniques in New Orleans, but an offensive line's strength is its cohesion, five players moving in unison. So Evans said he has adjusted his approach to meet the Packers' style, melding into the group.\n\nEvans said much of his time in camp has been spent synchronizing footwork with Bulaga and Linsley. There's an unspoken rhythm linemen find when they've spent years together. They understand where their teammate will be. The best are able to match their motions without communicating, especially necessary to deal with loud crowds on the road.\n\nIt requires plenty of side conversations for new offensive linemen to get their timing down.\n\n\"The biggest thing,\" Evans said, \"is I'm trying to mold to these guys. They've done a great job in pass pro and what they're doing. You'll see us on the sideline talking through things, and he's showing me some of the things that he's doing, and I'm telling him what I'm looking at and what I'm trying to accomplish. It's basically just that communication, because when you're out there, it's just muscle memory.\n\n\"Having those reps and those situations are critical, especially during this time. So it's not the first time you're doing it, in a game.\"\n\nEvans was versed in Bulaga's play style before signing as a free agent before the draft. Because the Saints were a pass-heavy team much like the Packers, putting additional stress on an offensive line's protection, Evans and Strief watched film of the Packers' offensive line in New Orleans.\n\nThat doesn't mean they imitated everything they saw on film. Blocking for Aaron Rodgers is very different than protecting Brees. In New Orleans, Evans said, the offensive line schemed to prevent interior pass rush. With Brees standing only 6-foot, and with limited mobility keeping him in the pocket, linemen were windshield wipers clearing their quarterback's vision.\n\nRodgers, two inches taller than Brees, doesn't stay within the pocket. On an extended play, his launch point can be scattered across the backfield. So while the Packers want to avoid breakdowns with their interior protections, they also must account for Rodgers' scrambling.\n\n\"Drew's launch point is different than Aaron's launch point,\" Evans said. \"Aaron can move around and do a lot of different things, and they get a lot of big plays off of that. So you set based on those things.\"\n\nEvans hasn't blocked for Rodgers in a game yet. He doesn't know if that will change Saturday in Washington, but the Packers' second preseason scrimmage will be an important step. Even without the intensity of a regular-season game, it will be the first time Evans and Bulaga mimic their movements on the road, honing their nonverbal communication.\n\nWhenever Rodgers joins the Packers' starting offense, he'll see firsthand how much further Evans has to transition. Early in camp, Rodgers said he has been impressed with Evans' reactionary athleticism as a pass blocker, and his strength moving defensive tackles as a run blocker.\n\n\"I think he kind of has a chip on his shoulder, too,\" Rodgers said. \"I'm not going to speak for him - you know, he's never said this - but it seems as if last year was tough for him being a veteran and not feeling like he really had a home. We've kind of embraced him here and made him feel comfortable being part of this family, and I think he's going to flourish for us.\"\n\nSkip in Skipx\n\nEmbed\n\nx\n\nShare\n\nCLOSEVIDEOS FROM GREEN BAY PACKERS TRAINING CAMP 2017Takeaways from Packers practice: Aug. 16 | 2:22\n\nPete Dougherty and Aaron Nagler try to read the tea leaves on what Mike McCarthy's plans are for Aaron Rodgers and look at an embarrassing backup QB moment.

Grab a strong cup of coffee and get caught up on everything you need to know about the Packers.\n\nWe'll start with Michael Cohen's look at the struggles the offense had in the screen game last Thursday night against the Eagles.\n\nFrom Michael:\n\nAs first impressions go, the initial attempts by the Green Bay Packers to execute screen passes landed somewhere between disjointed and disastrous during an exhibition game last week. They ran two of them on consecutive plays in the second quarter against the Philadelphia Eagles, and the net results were a sack, an injury and a pass batted down at the line of scrimmage.\n\nIt was an unsightly start for a team that has weaponized the screen pass in recent years, especially when former Packers tailback James Starks spelled Eddie Lacy in the backfield. Starks, who was released in February after a car accident left him with a severe concussion, caught 43 passes for 392 yards and three touchdowns in 2015, the best season of his career.\n\nMichael's latest podcast is up as well with tons of news and analysis:\n\nTom Silverstein writes on Justin McCray's second chance:\n\nJustin McCray was hoping for another crack at an NFL roster, and so far he's seized the moment with the #Packers. https://t.co/WqgLr9Ig46 -- Packers News (@PGPackersNews)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nJoe Whitt Jr. was not pleased with the hit that sidelined Damarious Randall:\n\nThe hit on #Packers WR Malachi Dupre probably looked worse, but the block on Damarious Randall irked Joe Whitt Jr. https://t.co/casv0Ffpk7 -- Packers News (@PGPackersNews)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nPete Dougherty has the latest Camp Insider, with Montay Crockett earning the Thumbs Up yesterday:\n\nUndrafted rookie WR Montay Crockett is a longshot for the #Packers roster, but he has one stand-out quality: speed. https://t.co/XNp4WyPWL4 -- Packers News (@PGPackersNews)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nMartellus Bennett seems to be enjoying these dog days of camp:\n\nI think @MartysaurusRex is enjoying the dog days of camp... pic.twitter.com/atyupJgM90 -- Aaron Nagler (@AaronNagler)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nBennett had plenty to say about his brother's activism:\n\nMartellus Bennett said he didn't know Michael was going to protest but \"I support Michael in everything he does.\" https://t.co/bQ7CejKnwh -- Packers News (@PGPackersNews)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nRyan Wood and I gave a quick recap of yesterday's practice:\n\nPost by packersnews.\n\nElsewhere, the Packers have some fun video from practice yesterday:\n\nFeelin' good at #PackersCamp! \u1f3c8\u1f6b4 pic.twitter.com/dZHNwu2WaL -- Green Bay Packers (@packers)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nRob Demovsky writes on the growing chemistry between Martellus Bennett and Aaron Rodgers:\n\n'Quarterback whisperer' Martellus Bennett talks chemistry with Aaron Rodgers https://t.co/PQz4wXMx1h#Packerspic.twitter.com/61USJf6sRZ -- ESPN Milwaukee (@ESPNMilwaukee)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nZachary Jacobson writes on how special Aaron Rodgers is:\n\nOn @CheeseheadTV: Sit Back, R-E-L-A-X, and Take a Break With Aaron Rodgers https://t.co/zxf9LNydT5#Packerspic.twitter.com/TUrMh4SsoJ -- Cheesehead TV (@cheeseheadtv)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nACME Packing has the first month of TV announcers for Packers games:\n\nTV announcers set for Packers' first four games of 2017 https://t.co/9uJlu6GSww -- Acme Packing Company (@acmepackingco)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nDom Capers counted 16 missed tackles against the Eagles:\n\nDom Capers counted 16 missed tackles in Packers' preseason opener https://t.co/sVlNqtOaa4 -- The Packers Wire (@ThePackersWire)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nJason Wilde writes on Jamaal Williams getting more opportunities:\n\nIn @WiStateJournal ~ As Ty Montgomery deals with a \"soft tissue\" injury, Jamaal Williams gets more opportunities.https://t.co/nvQsxm5IIs -- Jason Wilde (@jasonjwilde)\n\nAugust 16, 2017\n\nPFF noted the production coming from increased playing time from Nick Perry last year:\n\nNick Perry saw a huge increase in playing time in 2016, and delivered for the Packers pic.twitter.com/n5FoGhMyn9 -- Pro Football Focus (@PFF)\n\nAugust 8, 2017\n\nThis is hilarious:\n\nGn.

Grab a strong cup of coffee and get caught up on everything you need to know about the Packers.\n\nWe'll start with Tom Silverstein's look at the abundance of pressure Dom Capers sent in the team's first preseason game and what it means.\n\nFrom Tom:\n\nThe notion that the Packers are using blitzes they might employ against Seattle would be anathema in most NFL circles, but Capers decided this summer he wanted his defense to practice them under game-like conditions.\n\nIn 2014, Capers came up with a 4-3 look he wanted to spring on the Seahawks in a season opener in Seattle. He kept it a secret from the rest of the NFL, using it only in the privacy of the Packers' practice fields.\n\nThe Seahawks destroyed it, and while it turned out to be a poorly conceived idea, the Packers might have been better at it if they had tested it out in a game. Or maybe they would have realized it wasn't going to work.\n\nThis year, Capers, who has a revamped secondary that has many new pieces and moving parts, has decided he needs the live action to test out his plan. He is using the August games to create an identity for his defense and set the tone for the regular season.\n\nPete Dougherty recently sat down with Ted Thompson:\n\n.@PeteDougherty sat down with #Packers GM Ted Thompson and talked about his health, GM duties, scouting and more. https://t.co/C2gCw9NuAk -- Packers News (@PGPackersNews)\n\nAugust 18, 2017\n\nMichael Cohen and Tom Silverstein break down the play of the quarterbacks in camp:\n\nRyan Wood writes on Mike McCarthy's long-standing treatment of the national anthem in Green Bay:\n\nThe #Packers and Mike McCarthy have stressed the importance of the national anthem since he's been head coach. https://t.co/mnnbZdCyZU -- Packers News (@PGPackersNews)\n\nAugust 18, 2017\n\nElsewhere, Mike Florio thinks the time to re-do Aaron Rodgers' contract has come:\n\nIt's time for the Packers to rip up Aaron Rodgers' contract and pay him the amount he deserves https://t.co/vq0eUxPXJ5pic.twitter.com/y6lApJnXlQ -- SNF on NBC (@SNFonNBC)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nGreat look at Packers history, as usual, from Cliff Christl:\n\n#TBT: Let's set the record straight: The #Packers didn't draft Herb Adderley to be a running back.\n\n\u1f4d6: https://t.co/XWzPf6s0QPpic.twitter.com/uOw1a1ReO2 -- Green Bay Packers (@packers)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nReceiver World highlights some good work from Jeff Janis:\n\nExcellent job by @jrjanis using \"head and eyes\" while applying the \"rocker step\" on a fade route in the red zone!! pic.twitter.com/JkpLLKLZP3 -- Receiver World (@ReceiverWorld)\n\nAugust 18, 2017\n\nSweet aerial shot of Lambeau during the 1996 NFC Championship Game.\n\nMan, how dope is this picture? #Packerspic.twitter.com/Y8M1KjsTTQ -- Dusty (@DustyEvely)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nIf you just can't wait to watch the Packers take on the Vikings, here's a Madden preview:\n\nKevin King won't be adjusting to this one any time soon:\n\nLol the only weird thing about bein in Wisconsin is that \"UW\" is considered University of Wisconsin lol, Can never get used to that \u1f602 -- Kevin King (@King_kevvoo)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nLombardi Ave. reflects on the toll playing in the NFL took on Marco Rivera:\n\nMarco Rivera: Eleven years in league took toll on former Packers guard https://t.co/AmAWvbZuv7 via @lombardiavepic.twitter.com/Qhg5ktfbz0 -- FanSided NFL (@FanSidedNFL)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nJason Perone asks: What's the deal with Ted?\n\nOn @CheeseheadTV: What's the Deal with Ted Thompson? https://t.co/ydmPiaoCXr#Packers -- Cheesehead TV (@cheeseheadtv)\n\nAugust 18, 2017\n\nTake a look at Aaron Rodgers' first pass attempt during preseason of his rookie year:\n\nThe Packers Wire is looking for big things from Davante Adams:\n\nPackers WR Davante Adams on track for another monster year? https://t.co/oz2vdugWCo -- The Packers Wire (@ThePackersWire)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nEye In the Sky has a bunch of clips up from the preseason game:\n\nKenny Clark @KCBoutthatlife with the jerk and swim for the sack.

Five dollars from the sale of each hat, available through the Packers Pro Shop, will go to the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation.\n\n\"I think this will be very popular with our fans,\" Packers President and CEO Mark Murphy said of the hat, which includes the Packers \"G\" logo and a screenprint of former Packers coach Vince Lombardi.\n\nRELATED: McCarthy rules out four players vs. Washington\n\nRELATED: UW, Notre Dame fans will flock to Lambeau\n\nDuring the Oct. 22 game, fans will receive a banner on which they can write the name of someone they know who was affected by cancer.\n\nInformation on a \"text-to-donate\" effort will be announced later. Packers kicker Mason Crosby will participate in public service announcements and players will visit cancer patients in the hospital throughout the season.\n\nThe NFL and all 32 teams have worked since October 2009 to raise awareness for various kinds of cancers, most notably breast cancer. October is national Breast Cancer Awareness Month. The Packers and their partners expanded their initiative this year to include all cancers and screenings as necessary.\n\n\"There's always room for improvement,\" McDonald said. \"What you can catch at stage zero or one, you're in a far better place than catching at stage three or four once you are symptomatic.\"\n\nPrevious breast cancer awareness programs with the NFL and Packers led to a noticeable increase in breast cancer awareness and higher rates of mammograms at Bellin, McDonald said.\n\nMurphy said the NFL this year gave clubs more flexibility with their programs, so the Packers decided to include all forms of cancer.\n\n\"We often hear from fans during the month of October about their stories and how cancer has affected them.

Grab a strong cup of coffee and get caught up on everything you need to know about the Packers.\n\nWe'll start with Tom Silverstein's look at Max McCaffrey and how the young wide receiver could make things interesting at cutdown time.\n\nFrom Tom:\n\nIf you were charting all the receptions during Green Bay Packers' training camp, the leader wouldn't be Jordy Nelson or Randall Cobb or Davante Adams.\n\nIt likely would be Max McCaffrey.\n\n\"Every day in practice he's making plays,\" quarterback Aaron Rodgers said.\n\nLast training camp it was Geronimo Allison who emerged out of a group of young receivers and earned Rodgers' attention. Allison didn't make the final cut, but he was signed to the practice squad and then elevated to the 53-man roster in Week 8.\n\nThe 6-2, 200-pound McCaffrey has the bloodlines to be an NFL player, but he has been forced to enter through a side door, not through the first round like his brother, Christian, or the third round like his father, Ed.\n\nTom also has the Camp Insider from yesterday's practice, where he highlights Davante Adams' strong play:\n\nThumbs up to Davante Adams continuing to dominate in practice, thumbs down to a struggling Josh Hawkins. #Packershttps://t.co/HkpQS9gNnp -- Packers News (@PGPackersNews)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nMichael Cohen's notes are led by the return of Brett Goode:\n\nMason Crosby went 6-for-6 today on field goals, all held by veteran long snapper Brett Goode. https://t.co/JIHb20KJHI -- Packers News (@PGPackersNews)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nMichael and Tom debate which wide receivers will make the squad on Michael's podcast:\n\nI chatted with readers after practice yesterday, answering all sorts of questions on the Packers:\n\nIf you missed yesterday's Facebook Live session, replay is right here:https://t.co/YNmXEse2pI -- Aaron Nagler (@AaronNagler)\n\nAugust 17, 2017\n\nRyan Wood looks at Jahri Evans' transition to Green Bay:\n\nIn Jahri Evans' first practices with the #Packers he was clear he wasn't set in his ways.

What I've never heard is once the decision was made to move him to defense, who coached him up?\n\nGood question and kudos for referring to Adderley as a halfback, not a running back. Vince Lombardi was beginning to use the term running back in conversation when Adderley was selected No. 1 in the 1961 NFL Draft, but in his offense there was a left halfback, Paul Hornung, and a fullback, Jim Taylor, and that was how he referred to them when he talked strategy. I make that point because I think that's one of the reasons Hornung has been shortchanged by history. His role as the left halfback was much different than today's running backs.\n\nAs for Adderley, let's clear up two misconceptions.\n\nAt the Pro Football Hall of Fame website, it states Adderley had \"the unenviable task of competing against future Hall of Fame running backs Jim Taylor and Paul Hornung for a starter's spot.\"\n\nThat's really not true. Adderley has mentioned that and in those days of smaller rosters he spent time playing in the offensive backfield his first year. But the plan was never to have him compete with Hornung or Taylor for a job.\n\nThe Packers drafted Adderley with the hope he'd be another Lenny Moore, the Baltimore Colts' game-breaker who was a hybrid halfback/slot back/flanker as offenses were evolving from using two offensive ends to three receivers: A split end, tight end and flanker. In 1960, Hornung scored 15 touchdowns to tie for the league lead. Moore, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1975, tied for third with 13: Four rushing and nine receiving. He also led the Colts in rushing and finished second in receiving.\n\nIn 1959, Lombardi's first season as Packers coach, he had started out using a three-back set with Don McIlhenny as the right halfback, the same offense he had used as backfield coach of the New York Giants. In a strong-right formation, which was used most often, the right halfback would move out to a flanker position. In a strong-left formation, the right halfback would remain in the backfield.\n\nIn fact, in the second game, a 28-10 victory over Detroit, Hornung and Taylor combined for 60 yards in 24 carries, but McIlhenny was the leading rusher with 52 yards in six carries.\n\nBefore the next game against San Francisco, Taylor sustained second-degree burns to his right foot and hand at home in his kitchen and missed three games. (\"Total Football: The Official Encyclopedia of the National Football League\" has Taylor playing all 12 games that year, but that's wrong.) That left the Packers with three backs - Hornung, McIlhenny and Lew Carpenter - for three positions, along with newly signed Billy Butler, who had been cut as a defensive back in camp, but was re-signed to also help on offense. In the Packers' victory over the 49ers, McIlhenny got hurt and had to leave the game in the second quarter.\n\nConsequently, over the course of the season, Lombardi changed his offense and rookie Boyd Dowler began playing more in a three-receiver set. Although he was listed as a right halfback, Dowler wound up leading the Packers in receptions, but never carried the ball.\n\nA year later, following the 1960 season, Lombardi coached Lenny Moore in the Pro Bowl, and within a month after returning to Green Bay said he wanted to go back to a three-back set and move Dowler to closed end.\n\nThose plans never materialized. Ron Kramer, not Dowler, beat out Gary Knafelc and became what would now be referred to as the tight end. Dowler stayed at flanker. But it's unclear when Lombardi scrapped his three-back plans and whether an injury to Adderley affected his thinking.\n\nIn April, Lombardi said, \"Adderley is a possibility for three positions: Defensive halfback, a flanking back the type of Lenny Moore, or a running back. He shows the best possibility as a flanking back.\"\n\nAdderley played defense for the College All-Stars, then carried the ball twice and caught one pass in three preseason games before injuring his shoulder. Once the regular season started, Adderley returned kickoffs, but didn't have a catch or a carry when he was called on to replace an injured Hank Gremminger at cornerback on Thanksgiving Day in Detroit and found his home.\n\nLombardi often admitted he almost blew it by trying to make Adderley something he wasn't, a flanker or right halfback. \"I spent all those weeks trying to make a receiver out of him before I found out he wanted to be, and was meant to be, a defensive back,\" Lombardi wrote in \"Run to Daylight.\"\n\nHere's a second misconception. The Packers didn't convert Adderley to defense. He played it at Michigan State. Adderley played college football during the one-platoon era when strict substitution rules forced teams to use players both ways.\n\nTrue, Adderley was an explosive offensive back for the Spartans. He led them in rushing as a junior, and receiving and rushing as a senior. But he also played safety on defense, according to a questionnaire Adderley filled out for the Packers in October 1959. In fact, when Packers assistant coach Bill Austin scouted Adderley he said he was playing middle safety in a zone defense and wasn't aggressive.\n\nOn the other hand, Hank Bullough, who was freshman coach at Michigan State, wrote a glowing report on Adderley. Bullough, who played guard for the Packers in 1955 and 1958, was one of many ex-Packers recruited by business manager Jack Vainisi to file scouting reports for the team. Seven weeks before Vainisi died, Bullough wrote a report to him on Adderley. \"Great pro prospect. Slot back or defensive back. A great pair of hands. Great speed.\"\n\nSo who gets the credit for turning Adderley into a Hall of Fame corner? Considering Adderley's talents and how well he played in his first pro game at the position, I'm not sure he needed a lot of coaching. Phil Bengtson was an experienced and outstanding defensive coach. I'm sure he played a role. Lombardi's defensive backfield coach was 33-year old Norb Hecker. He had a long coaching career so he probably had some influence, too.\n\nBut I know from talking to Adderley, the teammate who took him under his wing and mentored him was Emlen Tunnell, a Pro Football Hall of Fame safety who spent the last three years of his career with the Packers. Tunnell was 37 years old when Lombardi brought him to Green Bay as a player and de facto assistant coach before there were any African-American assistants in the NFL.\n\nThere's no overstating the impact Tunnell had on his teammates. Based on my many interviews with Lombardi Packers, he was respected by all, black and white. In fact, Adderley told me Tunnell was the one who told Lombardi he was playing him at the wrong position.\n\n\"(Tunnell) was a great team man and well respected,\" Adderley told me in 2012. \"Lombardi brought Emlen Tunnell here with him. He brought him for a couple reasons. No. 1, he had respect for him. He loved Emlen. No. 2, he made a statement to let the white players in Green Bay know that I have a black man riding shotgun with me and we're going to get more black players on this team.\n\n\"When I came here Emlen was the man who brought everybody together: Black and white. All the guys loved Emlen Tunnell and respected Emlen Tunnell.\"\n\nSteve from St. Charles, MO\n\nLove your articles and a wild, tangential thought occurred to me when I read your recent one about the Packers' first-round draft picks. We've been blessed with great football players, but let's put our money where our mouth is. This is, after all, a professional team. So I'd like your take on the most important players economically. Who were the players that had the most to do with drawing gate revenue, and selling more jerseys and souvenirs?\n\nYou couldn't buy Packers jerseys during the Lombardi years. There were none for sale. Then came the 25-year drought made worse by the lack of players with any star power, so Brett Favre and Aaron Rodgers would seem to be the obvious answers to the second part of your question. But just to be sure, I confirmed it with Peggy Prebelski, our director of retail operations.\n\nOver the past 25 years, their jerseys have clearly been the biggest sellers.\n\nAs for what Packers have helped the gate the most, we need to start with the stars of the 1920s and '30s. As Curly Lambeau and members of the executive committee often said back then, the key to the Packers' survival was their ability to draw much bigger crowds on the road than other NFL teams.\n\nSo who were the Packers' biggest gate attractions during the 16-year run from 1929 to 1944 when they won six NFL titles under Lambeau?\n\nAdmittedly, I'm basing this on limited research, but I think when the Packers won their first three championships from 1929 to 1931, Johnny Blood probably got more ink than anyone else. He seemed to draw a lot of attention for his playmaking ability, off-the-field antics and magical name. Verne Lewellen received a lot of favorable press, too, but it seemed to be more in game stories, than pre-game, because his booming punts often decided the outcome.\n\nDuring the period from 1936 to 1944 when the Packers won their last three championships under Lambeau, Don Hutson probably garnered the most publicity for being a nonpareil among the game's receivers. He truly was a one-of-a-kind player. However, Clarke Hinkle, who was on two of those three title-winning teams, also drew attention for the jackhammer jolts he delivered as a runner and tackler. Hinkle was considered as tough as any player in the game.\n\nAgain, I don't think it can be overstated how seductive the name Johnny Blood was when pro football was a secondary sport to baseball, college football and others. Johnny Blood (his given name, McNally, was really never used in game programs, newspaper stories or wherever) was a name like Babe Ruth and Marilyn Monroe. Magical!\n\nPaul Hornung was the superstar of the early Lombardi teams and one of the first pro football players to hit it big with endorsement deals, but I'm assuming most of what he made was his. Also, by 1961, the Packers were selling out every home game and no one player was going to help their bottom line.\n\nPost Lombardi, there was a 24-year famine where no-show counts soared and so did indifference toward events like the intra-squad game and Packers luncheon. The Packers were essentially a faceless team the entire time. Then almost overnight in 1992, the pendulum swung again.\n\nThe Packers' current run of success is history-making, and it seems to me the franchise has not just expanded its fan base by thousands, but globally and by millions. And Favre was the player largely responsible for that over the first 16 of the past 25 years. As Ron Wolf says, \"He was the guy who did it on the field.\"\n\nJust recently, Wolf and I were conversing about how bad things had gotten in Green Bay before he was hired in 1991, and I'm not sure our youngest fans, those under 30, grasp that.\n\nSo here's a reminder.\n\nIn 1986, the no-show count for a Packers-Vikings game in Lambeau was nearly 10,000 on a 32-degree, as good-as-it-gets December afternoon. Boots Baker, who owned the King's X, a popular Packers hangout in Green Bay at the time, told the Green Bay Press-Gazette that before the game a friend had dropped off 13 tickets because he couldn't find any buyers and was desperate to try and recoup some of his money.\n\n\"He said, 'What can I do with them?'\" Baker related. \"I said, 'Got a fireplace?'\"\n\nDave from Green Valley, AZ\n\nI've read two or three accounts of the Ice Bowl that made reference to Kroll's West. I don't remember it being there in 1967. I've also read about how many people in northeastern Wisconsin watched the game on TV. Wasn't it blacked out in the Green Bay area?\n\nGood memory, better than some writers apparently. Kroll's West opened across from Lambeau Field in 1974. You might remember, as I do, when it was located on Main Street in downtown Green Bay. And, yes, the Ice Bowl was blacked out in the Green Bay market.\n\nCraig from Stevens Point, WI\n\nI look forward to your stories about all things Packers. My question is in regard to the actual field. It is my understanding that it has been lowered several times as part of the stadium additions through the years. I have looked at old photos that seem to show the stands further away from the field than in present day. Could you provide some insight?\n\nMy family has owned tickets in the 13 row behind the Packers' bench since the stadium was dedicated in 1957 and, to be honest, I haven't noticed any difference, although for many years I sat in the press box. So I asked Ted Eisenreich, our director of facility operations. He tells me the field was never really lowered. He said when the field was redone following the NFC Championship Game in January 1997, some of the crown was leveled. Then in 2007, when the DD Grassmaster system was installed and the field became sand-based, the need for a crown was eliminated. Today, there's only a small crown to help the tarp drain off when the field is covered. But the sidelines are as close to the stands as they've ever been.\n\nBob from Manitowish Waters, WI\n\nLeon Crenshaw played one year for Vince Lombardi. There are stories about him trying to keep his weight down for Lombardi. I can usually track the history of former Packers, but this guy seems to have disappeared. Do you have any ideas about him?\n\nCrenshaw played defensive tackle in 10 games in 1968, as you stated, but Phil Bengtson was the head coach. Lombardi was general manager that year. The year before, Lombardi's last as Packers coach, Crenshaw was released on the final cut.\n\nYou're right about Crenshaw's weight. In 1967, he reported at 315 pounds, 35 over what he said was his ideal playing weight. But he drew immediate attention in the nutcracker drill, the first full day of practice. Lee Remmel wrote in the next day's Press-Gazette that Crenshaw's turn at the nutcracker produced a \"thunderous impact, which elicited an involuntary shudder from every nearby viewer.\"", "date":

Despite being considered one of the most preventable yet least prevented forms of cancer and having high survival rate when treated early, millions of Americans are still reluctant to get screened for colon cancer or are not getting screened at recommended intervals.\n\n\"In football, a lot of game-changing decisions happen at midfield, right around the 50-yard line,\" said Chad Watson, director of sales and business development for the Packers. \"Similarly, a lot of important personal health decisions take place around age 50, including whether or not to get screened for colon cancer. The Packers-Cologuard Colon Cancer Awareness Campaign encourages adults to take a proactive role in their health so their careers as Packers fans do not get cut short.\"\n\nThrough an online pledge, ticket giveaway contest and digital campaign, the Packers-Cologuard Colon Cancer Awareness Campaign encourages screening-eligible fans age 50-plus to get checked for colon cancer and asks all Packers fans to help spread the word about the importance of screening. Key campaign elements include:\n\n* Screening Pledge & Ticket Giveaway - Fans can visit www.pckrs.com/ExactSciences for an opportunity to learn more about colon cancer and to enter to win Packers prizes by pledging to get screened or encouraging friends and family to take action. Four Grand-Prize winners will receive two tickets to attend the Oct. 22, 2017, game against New Orleans Saints at Lambeau Field. Additional prizes, such as Packers Pro Shop gift cards and autographed footballs, will be awarded to fans throughout the season.\n\n* Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation - On Oct. 22, visitors to the Cologuard booth on the Fan Walkway outside Lambeau Field will have the opportunity to play a ball toss game to help raise awareness and earn donations to the Vince Lombardi Cancer Foundation, courtesy of Exact Sciences.\n\n* Packers Hall of Famer Jerry Kramer - A member of the famous Lombardi Packers teams of the 1960s that won Super Bowls I and II, Jerry Kramer will lend his voice and perspectives to the awareness campaign throughout the season. In a variety of media, Kramer will discuss the life lessons he learned from Coach Lombardi, how the team reacted to the coach's cancer diagnosis and why he remains involved in cancer awareness charities and causes.\n\n\"Coach Lombardi taught that in sports and in life, winning requires teamwork and commitment to a shared goal,\" said Kevin Conroy, chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. \"Colon cancer is highly treatable if detected early, but not enough Americans are getting screened. This may be because people are uncomfortable with the topic or do not realize there are noninvasive screening options, such as Cologuard for people 50 and above at average risk for colon cancer. With this awareness campaign we're working to turn that around by encouraging fans to talk to their doctor, friends and family members about colon cancer screening options.\"\n\nWisconsin-headquartered Exact Sciences is the maker of Cologuard, the only noninvasive screening option that uses the DNA found in a person's stool sample to detect colon cancer and precancerous growths.

Additional theaters will be announced.\n\nAs promised by filmmaker Ryan Churchill, Green Bay will get its own premiere. Bay Park and Green Bay East will each host special screenings on Sept. 6 that will include a tailgate with beer, brats and Bloody Marys 90 minutes prior to the screening, and a 30-minute Q&A with cast and crew, including mixed martial artist Chuck Liddell, afterward.\n\nRELATED: Holy cow! Packers comedy hits the red carpet\n\nRELATED: Packers movie has fun on, off the set\n\nTickets for the premiere -- 6:30 p.m. at Bay Park and 7:30 p.m. at Green Bay East -- are on sale for $18 at marcustheatres.com. They include the screening, Q&A and access to the tailgate.\n\nDetails of a post-party at Titletown Brewing Co., along with other festivities, are still to be announced.\n\nIt will be the first real opportunity for Packers fans to get a look at the romantic comedy/buddy comedy that was filmed primarily at an Ashwaubenon house at the corner of Oneida Street and Stadium Drive near Lambeau Field in the fall of 2015 and winter of 2016. Other locations included the Green Bay Press-Gazette. Several scenes were shot in Los Angeles.\n\nSet during the 2009 football season, the feature-length film tells the story of what happens when diehard Packers fan Ben \"Zagger\" Zagowksi decides to use his wedding fund money to buy a house next to Lambeau so he can party on game days. When it turns into \"Graceland for Cheeseheads,\" it causes problems with his fiancee.\n\nBeloit native Ryan Churchill, who plays Zagger, co-wrote and co-produced the independent project with fellow Los Angeles actor Nick Greco. The movie made its world premiere in April with a sold-out showing at the Wisconsin Film Festival in Madison, where it won the Jury Award. It also was named Best Comedy at the Independent Filmmakers Showcase in L.A.\n\n\"Born and raised a diehard Packers fan, this film is a passion project for me and so many of our local cast and crew members,\" Churchill said in a statement. \"Being able to shoot in my home state, in the parking lot of Lambeau Field with the tremendous support of the Green Bay community was a dream come true. We can't wait to share this relatable story of football super fandom.\"\n\n\"The 60\" features cameos by former Packers players Ahman Green, John Kuhn and Mark Tauscher. Green Bay Mayor Jim Schmitt, WFRV newscaster Tom Zalaski and rock band Muddy Udders also show up, along with a host of local extras during a tailgating scene and a cow from Ebert Enterprises in Algoma.\n\nThere's plentiful name dropping of local landmarks and some fun with local dialect, too.\n\nThe movie's Superfan Contest and Sweepstakes gives Packers fans a shot at winning tickets to the Packers season opener against the Seattle Seahawks on Sept. 10, VIP access to the Green Bay premiere and tailgate party at \"The 60\" house, merchandise and other prizes. To enter, fans should post a photo or video to the film's Facebook or Instagram accounts with hashtag #The60 that demonstrates what makes them a Packers superfan.

Wochit\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nHe was born in England, grew up in Seattle and calls the road home these days, but no matter where Barns Courtney has been, he's never been a football guy.\n\nUntil he came to Green Bay.\n\n\"I know nothing about sports. Nothing. The first time I ever learned anything about football was going into the Lambeau stadium,\" the 26-year-old singer/songwriter said over breakfast at the Radisson Hotel & Conference Center last week, the foot he broke when he jumped off the Miller Lite Oasis stage at Summerfest in June propped up on the booth seat.\n\nCourtney had played Lollapalooza in Chicago the weekend prior and took the Green Bay Packers up on their invitation to come spend a couple of days at Lambeau Field. It seemed only appropriate the artist who recorded a special \"Green and Gold\" version of his song \"Glitter and Gold\" get acquainted with the legendary venue where the heart-pounding, foot-stomping anthem is destined to become a fan favorite this season.\n\nThe chance to see firsthand the history and tradition of the team had a profound effect on the musician who spent all his time as a kid playing in bands, not following sports.\n\n\"I was so much out of that scene growing up that when I went into that stadium for the first time, into the Hall of Fame, and I actually sat down and saw all the history of the Packers and how the team came together, and started to figure out how the players felt about playing football, it was really genuinely an exciting experience for me,\" he said. \"Imagine if you haven't watched a TV series, and it's been out for ages and everyone's talking about it, and then you finally decide to watch it and you just binge watch the whole thing. It's amazing.\"\n\nRELATED:10 of the all-time best Packers songs\n\nRELATED: Packers' winning streak inspires new rap song\n\nIt was the Packers who reached out to Courtney after hearing his gritty \"Glitter and Gold\" last year. The bluesy rocker Barns recorded in a decommissioned old folks home in Tottenham, England, using old filing cabinets and film cans for percussion, went to the top of the UK Spotify charts and was a radio hit, too. The team contacted him this spring to see if he would be willing to rewrite some of the lyrics for a Packers-themed version of the song.\n\nGreen & Gold! \u1f4aa@BarnsCourtney \u1f3b6: https://t.co/CGmAbs0S0gpic.twitter.com/YPRMyHxfcA -- Green Bay Packers (@packers)\n\nAugust 9, 2017\n\nAlways looking to explore new musical territory, he thought it sounded like a fun project. It wasn't until he started doing his homework on the team that he realized there were striking parallels between football and his experiences in music.\n\nCourtney knows a thing or two about overcoming hardship and the fight to win. He signed to Island Records at age 19, only to have his band, Dive Bella Dive, get dropped from the label without its completed album -- a project he had poured his heart and soul into -- ever getting released. Suddenly the artist who thought he had hit the jackpot by scoring a record deal right of high school was working at a computer store and selling cigarettes to pay the bills.\n\n\"I think you need a lot of determination and fire in your belly to play professionally, whether that's professional football or being a professional musician. A lot of the adversities I've faced, losing my record deal and struggling to succeed, the kind of themes that I've written about on my first record, apply themselves very well to football and to sports,\" he said.\n\n\"As a writer, I don't write about things that I don't know about it. I tried to be as truthful and as honest as possible in my lyrics. but when I actually delved into what the Packers are about and their history, and delved into what the players go through on a daily basis, I realized there were so many parallels with what the song 'Glitter and Gold' was already about I hardly had to change any of the lyrics at all. 'Glitter and Gold' is all about the struggle to succeed. It's all about gritting your teeth in the face of adversity.\"\n\nOpening lyrics like \"I am flesh and I am bone/Rise up, ting ting, like glitter and gold/I've got fire in my soul/Rise up, ting ting, like glitter/Like glitter and gold\" needed only minor tweaks to sub in \"green and gold.\"\n\nAfter seeing old footage of the Ice Bowl, the chorus of \"the dark, the dark, the dark\" became \"the cold, the cold, the cold.\" A line that references everybody in the nosebleeds singing out is applicable to both football games and music gigs -- something Courtney was mindful of as he made changes.\n\n\"I wanted to be sure if I was doing this that it was something that was true for me as well, because people can see through it when you're not being honest,\" he said. \"When I lost my first record deal with Island, I spent three years with zero success trying to get back into making music. So the song is this defiant, passionate, raging plea to do what I love again. That emotion and that feeling and the vast majority of the lyrics matched up perfectly, like being on the field and having to fight against an opposing team.\"\n\nThe Packers released a 48-second snippet of the song on the team website Aug. 9 with an accompanying video that features Packers defensive highlights. It debuted at Lambeau during the preseason game against the Philadelphia Eagles and will be used throughout the season as \"a defense pump-up,\" said Gabrielle Valdez Dow, vice president of marketing and fan engagement for the Packers.\n\n\"We want it to be organic. We want it to be natural. We want fans to enjoy it. It's not going to be something that we're going to require fans to do or say or learn,\" she said. \"It was just kind of a neat song. When you listen to the lyrics of how he rewrote it, it's pretty meaningful.\"\n\nCourtney didn't know how meaningful until he immersed himself in the Lambeau experience during his visit. He walked through the tunnels. Watched the videos of fans flooding onto the field after the 1967 Ice Bowl win and toppling the field goal post. Studied the black-and-white photos of the \"old-timey guys.\"\n\n\"The more time I spent in -- how do you say it, Lambeau? -- Lambeau stadium, the more it started to dawn on me what a big deal this was and what an honor it is to be connected to such a historic team,\" he said. \"The more I learned about them and how it's been sold out every game since the '60s, the more I started to understand the weight of what exactly it was I've been given an opportunity to take a part in.\n\n\"This is a real family that I'm entering into. This is a real community. It's not just a football team.\"\n\nDid a photo shoot for the @packers today in the tunnels under the stadium!#GreenBayPackerspic.twitter.com/HdLt2B2r2q -- Barns Courtney (@BarnsCourtney)\n\nAugust 10, 2017\n\nSo overwhelmed by the visit, Courtney, who knows a little something about prestigious venues (he opened for The Who at London's Wembley Stadium), says he has a hard time putting it into words.\n\n\"It was almost like a religious experience. It's the closest thing I can harken it to. These tunnels they walked me down, they felt sacred. There was a certain like something, some energy buzzing through them you could almost touch,\" he said. \"I just didn't expect to be as touched emotionally by all of this as I was.\"\n\nCourtney is wrapping up a busy summer of high-profile U.S. fests, from The Governors Ball Music Festival in New York City to Hangout Music Festival in Gulf Shores, Ala. He'll release his first full-length album, \"The Attractions of Youth,\" on Sept. 29, and his UK tour kicks off mid-September.\n\nHe'll be back in Green Bay on Dec. 23 to perform \"Green and Gold\" at halftime of the Minnesota Vikings-Packers game. Dow has already tried to prep him for the potential weather conditions. Mainly \"the cold, the cold, the cold.\"\n\n\"We are called the frozen tundra for a reason,\" she said. \"I just wanted to prepare him for that.\"\n\nHumbled his song will be played in front of 80,000 fans on game days, Courtney is fully on board with all things green and gold.\n\n\"I feel grateful to be here, to be able to do this. Because they've decided to adopt me as their artist, I'm grateful to adopt them as my team. When I commit to something I go all out. I'll be there at the games screaming my ass off,\" he said. \"When I go and play in December I'm going to give it 110 percent. ... I don't want to put my name to things that I don't think are great, and this is a phenomenal team.\"\n\nCourtney hopes there's more than one opportunity to play the song for Packers fans.\n\n\"I'm going to perform in December, and when you guys are in the Super Bowl, of course.\"\n\nHe's going to fit in just fine.\n\nGet the song\n\n\"Green and Gold\" is available for download for 99 cents at

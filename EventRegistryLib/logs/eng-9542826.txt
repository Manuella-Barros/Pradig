About half of the population is children, many of whom have been repeatedly displaced and forced to shelter in tents and unstable housing.\n\nChildren are more vulnerable to the impacts of the war in the Gaza Strip, compared to adults. UNICEF says they are disproportionately killed and injured and suffer more acutely from disruptions to health care, education and access to food and water.\n\nIsrael declared war on the Palestinian militant group Hamas after its October 7 terror attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of about 250 hostages.\n\nMore than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's counteroffensive, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. At least 14,000 of those deaths are children.\n\nUNICEF reiterated a February statement by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee calling on Israel to facilitate aid operations to Gaza.\n\n'We are calling on Israel to fulfill its legal obligation, under international humanitarian and human rights law, to provide food and medical supplies and facilitate aid operations, and on the world's leaders to prevent an even worse catastrophe from happening,\" the committee said.\n\nThe Voice of America provides news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of over 326 million people.

Nine children were reportedly killed in attacks during the first three weeks of April.\n\n\"As deadly attacks continue, children and their families are forced to endure yet more loss and destruction,\" said Regina De Dominicis, UNICEF Regional Director for Europe and Central Asia, as she concluded a visit to Ukraine this week. \"Every attack sets back recovery and rebuilding efforts, prolonging the deterioration in children's quality of life. I am troubled to see that attacks across the country continue, destroying schools, health facilities and residential buildings. Nowhere is safe for children.\"\n\nAccording to official UN data, at least 600 children have been killed in attacks since the escalation of the war in 2022. More than 1,350 children have been injured. The true number of children killed and injured is likely considerably higher.\n\nThe infrastructure that children rely on also continues to come under attack. Thousands of homes, 36 health facilities and 140 educational facilities were damaged or destroyed in the first three months of the year. Attacks affecting power supplies and water sources have further disrupted critical services, putting children's lives and well-being at further risk.\n\nTwo years of war preceded by two years of COVID-19 has meant children's access to schooling has been disrupted for more than four years - years equivalent to a primary education. Nearly half of children enrolled in school in Ukraine are missing out on in-person schooling, with almost one million children across the country not able to access any in-person learning at all due to insecurity.\n\nAmid ongoing attacks, UNICEF is working across Ukraine to preserve learning opportunities for children through rehabilitating schools and shelters, providing at-home learning kits and online learning support. In 2023, UNICEF reached 1.3 million children with formal and non-formal learning.\n\nUNICEF is also delivering mental health and psychosocial support including through safe spaces, protection and support hubs, reaching 2.5 million children and caregivers last year alone.\n\nTogether with partners, UNICEF is rebuilding critical water and health infrastructure destroyed or damaged by attacks.\n\nCurrently, UNICEF requires an additional $250 million to ensure critical support for children and families inside Ukraine including in frontline areas, for humanitarian and recovery programmes in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "indiaeducationdiary.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Education,Education News India,Education News  | India Education Diary"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UNICEF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosocial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychosocial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Educational technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caregiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://indiaeducationdiary.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240426_Ukraine.webp?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542826", "eventUri": "eng-9542826", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-01", "textStart": 202, "textEnd": 211}], "sentiment": -0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

UNICEF is pleased to play a role in the introduction of these vaccines along with key partners like WHO and the Gavi Secretariat\".\n\nOn January 27, the Vice Presidency for Science, Technology, and

Biden and Trump had a brief exchange on the war in Gaza but did not have a substantive discussion on how to end the conflict which has killed 38,000 in the enclave, according to the Gaza health ministry, and caused a massive humanitarian crisis with widespread hunger. The war began when Palestinian Hamas militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people and abducting some 250 others, according to Israeli tallies. \u201cThe only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas,\u201d Biden said. Trump responded by saying Biden has \u201cbecome like a Palestinian,\u201d which rights advocates said came across as a slur. \u201cActually, Israel is the one [that wants to keep going], and you should let them go and let them finish the job. He (Biden) doesn\u2019t want to do it. He\u2019s become like a Palestinian but they don\u2019t like him because he\u2019s a very bad Palestinian. He\u2019s a weak one,\u201d Trump said. On Friday, Trump again used the term \u201cPalestinian\u201d in a similar way, this time saying in a rally that Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, was Palestinian. \u201cHe\u2019s become a Palestinian because they have a couple more votes or something,\u201d he added. The Council on American Islamic Relations advocacy group said Biden was wrong to claim that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants the war to end, while adding it viewed Trump\u2019s Palestinian comment in the debate as a racist insult. \u201cFormer president Trump\u2019s use of \u2018Palestinian\u2019 as an insult was racist. President Biden\u2019s touting of his military support for the Israeli government\u2019s genocide in Gaza was callous,\u201d Corey Saylor, research and advocacy director at CAIR, said in a statement. Israel denies allegations of genocide. \u201cTo insinuate that being Palestinian is somehow a bad thing, as former president Trump did when he called President Biden Palestinian, reeks of racism and anti-Arab hatred,\u201d Paul O\u2019Brien, executive director of Amnesty International USA, said. Human rights advocates have reported a rise in Islamophobia, anti-Palestinian bias and antisemitism in the US since the latest eruption of conflict in the Middle East. The war in Gaza and Washington\u2019s support for Israel has also led to months of protests across the United States calling for an end to the conflict. Trump also faced criticism for using the term \u201cblack jobs\u201d and \u201cHispanic jobs\u201d while claiming immigrants who were coming into the US from its border with Mexico were taking away those employment opportunities. The Trump campaign did not have an immediate comment to the criticism. Immigration is a key election issue and Trump has claimed Biden has failed to secure the southern US border, ushering in scores of criminals. Studies show immigrants do not commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans. \u201cThe fact is that his (Biden\u2019s) big kill on the black people is the millions of people that he\u2019s allowed to come in through the border,\u201d Trump said during the debate. \u201cThey\u2019re taking black jobs, and they\u2019re taking Hispanic jobs.\u201d Civil rights organisation NAACP wrote on X: \u201cWhat exactly are black and Hispanic jobs!?!\u201d. It added: \u201cThere is no such thing as a black job.\u201d Amnesty International\u2019s O\u2019Brien said that Trump\u2019s comments on immigration were grounded in white supremacy. \u201cIt is disheartening that false narratives grounded in white supremacy and racism about people seeking asylum at the border and immigrant communities in the United States continue to permeate our national discourse,\u201d he added. Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, an organisation that works to mobilise black voters, said Trump\u2019s remarks were not true and that Biden should have pushed back harder on such false claims. \u201cThat there are specific black jobs for black people that immigrants are coming to take. Utter nonsense,\u201d Shropshire said. Trump\u2019s campaign has made an effort to court black voters, with the former president visiting Detroit and Philadelphia in recent weeks. Some polls have shown a downtick in support for Biden among black voters, who historically have been among the Democratic Party\u2019s most loyal voting blocs.", "summary": "\u2018To insinuate that being Palestinian is somehow a bad thing, as former president Trump did when he called President Biden Palestinian, reeks of racism,\u2019 Amnesty said.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3268548/trump-slammed-racist-palestinian-insult-us-presidential-debate-biden", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/29/9decda6a-c3eb-496d-9c4a-bdcbe0168e4b_cacd3f6d.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:36:11", "author": "Reuters", "authors": ["Reuters"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.239}

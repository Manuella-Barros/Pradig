{"id": 243359804, "title": "\u00c9amonn Fitzmaurice: For Galway and Derry to survive the weekend, they must be prepared to drown", "text": "I\u2019m sure both sides will have revisited that semi-final for context and clues for the battle ahead. Much of what happens in Sunday's ALl-Ireland SFC quarter-final will be dictated by Derry\u2019s approach. Because of the nature of the goals that they have conceded in the last two months, they played with a more conservative shape and style the last two weekends, which was understandable and worked. They left bodies at home to guard against and to be set up for quick counter-attacks and turnovers. They tactically fouled Mayo to stop those quick counters. Think Chrissy McCaigue\u2019s foul on Aidan O\u2019Shea. They have changed their opposition kickout press away from the ultra-aggressive zonal press to a man-on-man one, with Odhran Lynch in a more withdrawn role. Conor Glass is once again patrolling his own \u2018D\u2019 with intent when the opposition attack. Ironically, if they adopt a similar strategy this weekend, Kerry will win. Comfortably. However, if they decide to re-use the model from last year's semi-final and really go for it, they can cause Kerry most problems. There are a plethora of little decisions to be made by Mickey Harte. Will McCaigue start on David Clifford? What about Eoin McEvoy or Diarmuid Baker? Could they double-team him? Does this suit Kerry more than Derry? How do they stop Shane Ryan getting away short kickouts, considering how important a score source this is for Kerry, without leaving themselves exposed at the back? They did very well on the Kerry kickout in the league game when they took away the pockets Kerry like to run into. Much has changed in the meantime though. The biggest decision Harte has to make, in my opinion, is how they attack. This one decision will have a huge bearing on the shape of the game. Last year Derry shredded Kerry at times by attacking with everyone. Kerry stubbornly tried to play with a sweeper which only helped Derry further. As well as having Odhran Lynch available as a plus-one attacker, Gareth McKinless was freed up and attacked at will. He ran amok. Their innovative attacking system peaked in that first half. For every Kerry action to the Derry man in possession there was a correct reaction from the then Ulster champions. McKinless\u2019 early goal was a perfect example: Lynch advanced with the ball in hand attacking up the left hand side - which he favours in general - as they attacked into the Canal End. As soon as Adrian Spillane left McKinless to engage Lynch and Paudie Clifford stepped off Conor McCluskey the chain reaction began with McCluskey receiving a handpass from Lynch which he slipped to the now free and onrushing McKinless, who drove at the heart of Kerry. Brendan Rogers thundered off his shoulder to take the pass and had his shot saved, but McKinless followed up to finish the move off. They overloaded the left side of the attack and with strong running, excellent forward spacing, perfectly timed support play and accuracy they breached the Kerry rearguard and created the goal chance. Until things went south for them this year, they successfully continued with that model throughout the National League. Last Saturday, Mayo were happy to go man-on-man with them so Lynch was the sole overload player. He attacked and did better than he has been, but still not perfectly. The turmoil this summer probably means his confidence wasn\u2019t sky-high. Those forward forays coupled with his outstanding performance in the penalty shootout, once more, should embolden him for Sunday. If Kerry play with a sweeper and Derry don\u2019t McKinless can kill them. At the peak of his powers with Tyrone between 2003 and 2008, Harte was brilliant at pulling a rabbit out of the hat on the biggest days, notably when playing Kerry. Be that the manic intensity they brought in the 2003 semi-final, his clever plan of starting the injured Peter Canavan in the final, taking him off but bringing him on again in the final quarter to guide the ship home, or his relocation of Joe MacMahon to the full-back line to deal with the Donaghy-Walsh threat in the 2008 final. It isn\u2019t a surprise he needs now but a reprise of last year's game plan. Have Derry the collective courage for that approach? DROPCAP Before all that, All-Ireland champions Dublin tussle with a gritty Galway side on Saturday. The Connacht champions have overcome countless obstacles all season. Similar to Derry, it is a plan from the past that they need to win. Their gameplan from the 2022 All-Ireland final might have been dusted off. As Mayo proved, the most effective way to go at Dublin is by attacking them. Sit off them in a game of containment and they will beat you well, eventually. You have to get them turned and going the other way. Like all sides, they are vulnerable when attacked early. P\u00e1draic Joyce won\u2019t be thinking of any tomorrows and if they are any way right he will have to go for broke and play Damien Comer, Shane Walsh and Cillian McDaid together from the start for the first time in an age. If Galway play with Comer and Robert Finnerty close to goals and with Walsh at the top of a triangle outside them they can cause the Dubs problems. Their fullback line has looked vulnerable. At the other end of the pitch Galway are tough to break down but against Dublin they will find it harder to create the plus-ones and plus-twos that they favour. Dublin play with such a stacked forward line it is hard to know who to cheat off. Even the likes of Brian Howard and Se\u00e1n Bugler coming from the half back line can cause havoc if left free. John Daly, Dylan McHugh and Liam Silke are excellent at reading when and where they need to be but they will all have their hands full with their direct opponents this evening. To win they may have to back their one-on-one defenders more often than they are accustomed to. Once more, shutting down Brian Fenton will be a priority, while simultaneously giving Paul Conroy the platform to play at the level he had been at. John Maher seems the obvious man for the Fenton job but it could be a role for Se\u00e1n Kelly. It might get the best out of the Moycullen man. Even if they get all of this right it is still a stretch for Galway to pull it off. Once more Dublin showed why they are the champions against Mayo. Even though many were under par they had the collective know-how to salvage a draw at the end. Because of their level of success, Dublin now embody The Backwards Law, which is how to get what you want by letting go. Trust the process and trust each other to find a way. During their training, elite US Navy SEALs undergo a challenge called Drown Proofing. They are thrown into a nine-foot pool with hands and feet tied. The objective is to survive for five minutes. Understandably some panic and have to be lifted out. The secret to passing the test is to completely relax, allow yourself sink to the bottom, then kick off the bottom of the pool to propel yourself towards the surface to take in vital air. Repeat the steps for five minutes and you pass the test. Most teams are desperate for success and tighten up down the stretch as a result. Panic sets in. Mistakes happen and the game slips away, often by the smallest of margins. It is a Catch-22 situation. The desperation that drives them to succeed can be their undoing. They drown. Dublin and the Limerick hurlers are the opposite. When those sides won their first medals in 2011 and 2018 that poise was not evident. Nowadays, they relax and embrace the challenge. It is easier to do this when you have a bagful of medals. The challenge is different. Rather than being about getting a medal, it is about thriving in adversity to win another. It has been developed with time and success and is a powerful mindset. If Galway can stay with Dublin and get them down the stretch that ability to not panic, to keep doing the simple things well when the need is greatest, to keep taking in air, may once more prove to be the difference.", "summary": "Derry and Galway must dust off old gameplans to have a chance in this weekend's All-Ireland quarter-finals", "url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/gaa/arid-41425975.html", "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8366/4183420_2_seoimage1x1_fenton_1_.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:31:00", "author": "\u00c9amonn Fitzmaurice,Irishexaminer.com", "authors": ["\u00c9amonn Fitzmaurice", "Irishexaminer.com"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.101}

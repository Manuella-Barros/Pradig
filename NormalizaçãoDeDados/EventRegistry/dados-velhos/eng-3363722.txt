While Perera was overlooked for the home series against Zimbabwe, Siriwardana's last appearance for the national side came in the limited-overs series against Bangladesh in March-April this year.\n\nVeteran fast bowler Nuwan Kulasekara, who featured in the final ODI against Zimbabwe, has been given the axe alongside Asitha Fernando and Lahiru Kumara. In their place, the selectors have included Malinda Pushpakumara, who recently made his Test debut against India and young seamer Vishwa Fernando. Both Pushpakumara and Fernando are yet to make their debut in the 50-over format.\n\n\"Every team goes through a rough patch,\" skipper Tharanga said. \"This is something that happens in cycles to every team and every nation no matter how great a cricketing nation they are.\n\nSri Lanka conceded 600+ totals in two of the three Tests and were asked to follow on in the last two games before succumbing to innings defeats. While the island nation weren't expected to topple the No. 1 ranked side during the series, the manner of defeat came across as rather baffling as their side kept slipping to newer depths every time. With the five-match ODI series and a lone T20I coming up, the skipper noted that every team had its share of lows and goes through a phase of transition before coming back on top.\n\n\"Sri Lanka dominated in all three formats for a good 18 years - don't forget this now when we are going through a rough patch. Obviously there are some things we can't openly discuss due to strategic reasons but there are certain areas behind the scenes that need to fall into place for us. These areas are being taken care of, and we are seeing the results behind the scenes - however it will take a little more time for it to be seen externally, so please have patience, and most importantly have faith.\"\n\nThe skipper also reposed faith in the limited-overs outfit and felt that they are well equipped to fare better against their opponents in the 50-over format of the game. \"Sri Lanka have always been stronger in our white-ball format, and I am confident that we will come out strong and beat India. We have the talent, we have the skill. We have been putting in the hard work, we just need the spirit, and for that we need your support too.\n\n\"The support of our fans plays a big role in the morale of the team. We play for our country and our goal is to bring pride to our family of 20 million in this nation - so your support is something that matters greatly to us.\n\n\"Yesterday despite the defeat, we saw spectators cheering us and applauding us - this is what we need.

They beat us quite comfortably,\" said Sharma.\n\n\"So you know in one-day cricket they are a very good team. We just got to do what we have been doing in the past few years.\"\n\nThe series offers India's second line of talent a moment in the spotlight with spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin, and pacemen Mohammed Shami and Umesh Yadav, being rested by selectors.\n\nYoung spinners Axar Patel and Yuzvendra Chahal are expected to make the starting lineup in one or more of the five matches.

Sri Lanka dominated in all three formats for a good 18 years - don't forget this now when we are going through a rough patch,\" Tharanga said.\n\n\"Obviously, there are some things we can't openly discuss due to strategic reasons but there are certain areas behind the scenes that need to fall into place for us. These areas are being taken care of, and we are seeing the results behind the scenes - however it will take a little more time for it to be seen externally, so please have patience, and most importantly have faith,\" added the opener.\n\nTharanga promised the home fans, who are fast losing patience with the team, that his side will bounce back by beating India in the five-ODI series, which begins with the first game in Dambulla on August 20.\n\n\"Sri Lanka have always been stronger in our white-ball format, and I am confident that we will come out strong and beat India. We have the talent, we have the skill. We have been putting in the hard work, we just need the spirit, and for that we need your support too,\" said the 32-year-old.\n\nTharanga then concluded his appeal on an emotional note.\n\n\"The support of our fans plays a big role in the morale of the team. We play for our country and our goal is to bring pride to our family of 20 million in this nation - so your support is something that matters greatly to us. Yesterday despite the defeat (by an innings and 171 runs in the third Test here), we saw spectators cheering us and applauding us - this is what we need. It inspires us to fight harder too,\" requested the limited overs captain.\n\nDeep inside, Tharanga knows that such emotional calls to rally behind his team will only work with the currently hugely disappointed Lankan fans if his team is able to overcome, or atleast compete with a strong Indian team in the forthcoming limited overs series.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "id": "9321567", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "Upul Tharanga pleads for patience from fans - Times of India", "image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60076190/60076190.jpg?75231", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1354, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1363}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "104", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "130", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "50973", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dambulla", "label": {"eng": "Dambulla"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "One Day International"}, "id": "302607", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cricket"}, "id": "305608", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}, "id": "309560", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}, "id": "309904", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "Result (cricket)"}, "id": "346333", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Result_(cricket)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka Cricket"}, "id": "378451", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_Cricket"}, {"label": {"eng": "2009 attack on the Sri Lanka national cricket team"}, "id": "595115", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_attack_on_the_Sri_Lanka_national_cricket_team"}, {"label": {"eng": "Upul Tharanga"}, "id": "654610", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upul_Tharanga"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 25, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 28, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 32, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 865, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 866, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 867, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News and Media", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/News_and_Media"}], "time": "16:50:00"}

The hosts gunned down the target with eight wickets to spare.\n\nBut Kohli has come a long way since. Only two batsmen - Sachin Tendulkar (49) and Ricky Ponting (30) - have more ODI hundreds than Kohli's 28.\n\nThe 28-year-old also has the most hundreds while chasing. Tendulkar had held the record for years with 17 tons in 232 innings while Kohli took a mere 102 innings to surpass the Master Blaster's record.\n\nAt Dambulla for the ODIs now, another beautiful location. \u00f0\u0178~\u0160\u00f0\u0178\" pic.twitter.com/StkAZQzUGh- Virat Kohli (@imVkohli)\n\n18 August 2017\n\nFew things never change - only the legend grows. #ThisDayThatYear In 2008, @imVkohli sat on this very chair during his debut game #SLvINDpic.twitter.com/0LCwQKZQ1i- BCCI (@BCCI)\n\n18 August 2017\n\nKohli has taken a special liking for Sri Lanka - 1856 of his career ODI runs have come against the islanders in 41 matches. He also boasts of six hundreds against the former world champions.\n\nKohli has had a dream run over the last couple of years. He was at the peak of his powers in 2016, smashing hundreds against Australia in the ODIs before turning his focus to T20 cricket. After hammering Australia, Pakistan and West Indies to submission, he enjoyed a record-breaking IPL, amassing 973 runs including four hundreds.\n\nKohli also became the first batsman in history to score double hundreds in four successive Test series. For a short while, he also happened to be the only batsman to average over 50 in all three formats.\n\nThe Delhi dasher has so far scored 8257 runs from 189 ODIs and 4658 runs including 17 hundreds from 60 Tests. In 49 T20 Internationals, Kohli has 1748 runs.\n\nAs captain, Kohli has been on a roll - he has so far led India to eight successive series wins. He had also led India to ODI and T20 series triumphs over England before overseeing the journey to the final of the Champions Trophy in England.\n\nIt all started on this very chair, this very date and this very ground. 9 years today with the Indian cricket team!

Virat Kohli and his men won the series 3-0, and now their focus will be on the upcoming five-match ODI series, with the first game scheduled at Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Dambulla on Sunday.\n\nIt is a shift from whites of Test cricket to coloured clothing, but one hopes that Sri Lanka can come up with some decent cricket and at least challenge the visitors. India will start the ODI series as favourites too.\n\nMUNIR UZ ZAMAN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn all formats of the game, the men in blue are a force in world cricket. India team is ranked world number three while Sri Lanka are languishing in eighth place. India comes into this series with a win over West Indies in the ODI series and a runner-up finish in the Champions Trophy. They are high on confidence.\n\nIndia provided rest to some of their key bowlers such as R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and pacers, too. Despite that, India has a strong team with Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Kuldeep Yadav as their key bowlers. India are already looking ahead at the ICC World Cup 2019, and building a core set of players for the quadrennial event.\n\nHowever, the team has its full-strength when it comes to the batting department. Limited overs specialists such as MS Dhoni and Kedar Jadhav will strengthen the batting side, which comprises the likes of Kohli, Shikhar Dhawan and Rohit Sharma. Looking at the quality in the team, which is by no means, India's best squad, Kohli has a wonderful set of players, which makes them a force in world cricket.\n\nIndia are moving from strength to strength in the last couple of years. Sri Lanka, on the other hand, have been in the decline after players such as Mahela Jayawardene, Kumara Sangakkara and Tilakaratne Dilshan retired.\n\nMS Dhoni.JEWEL SAMAD/AFP/Getty Images\n\nSri Lanka have not been able to replace their stalwarts, which can be seen from their performances in the last few month or years in ODI format. They lost to South Africa, drew against Bangladesh (1-1), failed to reach the knockout stages of the Champions Trophy, and embarrassingly lost to minnows Zimbabwe in the last series. This is not the kind of results one expects from the island country.\n\nIt is desperate times for Sri Lanka cricket. This team for the ODI series against India, led by Upul Tharanga needs to find their mojo back, and show their true colours. They are a side capable of beating India, for which all their players including Lasith Malinga, Angelo Mathews and Kusal Perera need to shine.\n\nAngelo Mathews.Philip Brown/Getty Images\n\nThere is no doubting the talent in their squad, but seniors have to shoulder responsibility and act as the guiding light for the youngsters in the team.\n\nOne hopes that Sri Lanka can come up with good cricket and make something out of this ODI series, and send a strong answer to their critics. World cricket will always be better with a strong and competitive Sri Lankan team.\n\nIndia vs Sri Lanka ODI series\n\n1st ODI\n\nDate: Sunday, August 20.\n\nTime: 2.30pm local time, 2.30pm IST, 10am BST, 5am ET.\n\nVenue: Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium, Dambulla.\n\n2nd ODI\n\nDate: Thursday, August 24.\n\nTime: 2.30pm local time, 2.30pm IST, 10am BST, 5am ET.\n\nVenue: Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Pallekele.\n\n3rd ODI\n\nDate: Sunday, August 27.\n\nTime: 2.30pm local time, 2.30pm IST, 10am BST, 5am ET.\n\nVenue: Pallekele International Cricket Stadium, Pallekele.\n\n4th ODI\n\nDate: Thursday, August 31.\n\nTime: 2.30pm local time, 2.30pm IST, 10am BST, 5am ET.\n\nVenue: Premadasa Stadium, Colombo.\n\n5th ODI\n\nDate: Sunday, September 3.\n\nTime: 2.30pm local time, 2.30pm IST, 10am BST, 5am ET.\n\nVenue: Premadasa Stadium, Colombo.\n\nTV listings: India: Sony Six.

Photograph: Cricket West Indies\n\nAfter whitewashing Sri Lanka in the three Test series, India will start as the favourites in the five match ODI series, which starts in Dambulla, on Sunday, August 20.\n\nIn the Tests, Sri Lanka struggled with both bat and ball and will hope to be much more competitive in the ODIs.\n\nIts recent record has not been encouraging; the team was recently beaten 2-3 by Zimbabwe in an ODI series at home last month, which had led to Angelo Mathews resigning as captain.\n\nThe Upul Tharanga-led side will look to take some inspiration from the Sri Lankans' upset victory against India in the ICC Champions Trophy at the Oval in London in June.\n\nTheir young batting line-up left the Indians stunned as they chased down a mighty 322 with Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis and Angelo Mathews all hitting half-centuries.\n\nIndia, will look at this series to kick-start preparations for the 2019 World Cup in England.\n\nThe selectors have laid down the marker by bringing in youngsters, keeping out experienced campaigners like Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina have been kept out after they failed their fitness tests.\n\nThere is no doubting the fitness of India's 36-year-old wicket-keeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni, whom the selectors believe could still be an important player for India in England in 2019.\n\nK L Rahul's return gives Captain Virat Kohli and the team management more options in the middle order.\n\nAjinkya Rahane, who is also in contention, has struggled to find a permanent berth in the ODI team.\n\nHe failed to get a single game in the ICC Champions Trophy, but made an impact in the West Indies series that followed.\n\nOpening the batting in place of Rohit Sharma who was rested for the Windies series, Rahane hit a century and three fifties in five games.\n\nRohit's return at the top and other options for the middle order slots means Rahane could yet again find himself in the dugout.\n\nChief Selector M S K Prasad has announced that India will try out Rahul at number four.\n\n'He is too good a player to sit out. Because Shikhar (Dhawan) and Rohit are in very good form, we will start with KL in that particular order,' the former India 'keeper said.\n\n'These are different permutations and combinations we will keep trying till the end of this year and it will boil down to one particular pattern and then we will continue with that,' he added.\n\nAnother player in the reckoning for the middle order will be Manish Pandey who had a superb series for India 'A' in South Africa, scoring 307 runs in five games.\n\nSpinning all-rounder Kedar Jadhav will be handy in the Sri Lankan conditions along with Hardik Pandya who proved his mettle in the Test series.\n\nIn the absence of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, the team management will need to pick two spinners from Axar Patel, Yuzvendra Chahal and Kuldeep Singh.\n\nBhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah, who have done well recently, will be the two preferred choices in the fast bowling department.\n\nPlease click the boxes below to select your

Even partisan fans won't relish a one-sided contest between two mismatched teams as that detracts from the event as a whole.\n\nIndia pummeled Sri Lanka in the three Test series 3-0 to register their first ever clean sweep in a series of three Tests away from home. They now take on the hosts in a five match ODI series, starting Sunday.\n\nSri Lanka are a much better outfit in the limited overs and the matches are expected to be much more closely fought.\n\nHere is a close look at four close encounters between the two teams in ODIs.\n\nIndia vs Sri Lanka, ODI Final, Singer Akai Nidahas Trophy, R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo, 7th July 1998\n\nIndia's much-vaunted opening pair of Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly gave India a solid start with the Little Master at his very best. In Sri Lanka scores of 300 were a rare occurrence and the highest score successfully chased prior to this particular match was 281 by Sri Lanka against Zimbabwe in 1998.\n\nTendulkar and Ganguly both helped themselves to centuries scoring 128 and 109 respectively and put on 252 runs for the opening wicket. This was a record for the first wicket in ODIs at that time and is still the seventh highest opening partnership in ODIs. India ended up with a formidable 307/6 off their 50 overs.\n\nIn reply, Sri Lanka got off to a brisk start thanks to Sanath Jayasuriya. Aravinda De Silva played another typically belligerent innings of 105 in just 94 balls as Sri Lanka edged closer to victory.\n\nThe Lankans had the match in their grasp as they needed 28 runs off the last 28 balls with five wickets in hand. However, disaster struck in the form of three run-outs and India won a close match by six runs. Tendulkar was adjudged the Man of the Match.\n\nIndia vs Sri Lanka, ODI, Asia Cup, R Premadasa Stadium, Colombo, 27th July 2004\n\nElecting to bat first, India lost Tendulkar early but a century partnership between Virender Sehwag and Ganguly put them back on course.\n\nHowever, both Sehwag and Rahul Dravid fell in quick succession and Ganguly and Yuvraj Singh had to rebuild the innings. India finished with 271/6 off their 50 overs.\n\nIn reply, Sri Lanka lost wickets at regular intervals but Jayasuriya stood firm at one end and went after the bowling. He scored a blistering century and apart from Tillakaratne Dilshan (39) no other batsmen crossed 20.\n\nSri Lanka needed 18 runs off the last three overs with four wickets in hand and looked favourites at that time. However, Jayasuriya was caught and bowled by Sehwag and that started the rot.\n\nThe Lankans needed 11 runs off the last over but could manage only six and India won a thriller by four runs. Sehwag was the Man of the Match.\n\nIndia vs Sri Lanka, ODI, Madhavrao Scindia Cricket Ground, Rajkot, 15th December 2009\n\nOn an absolute belter of a track, Tendulkar and Sehwag went on the rampage after India elected to bat. They put on 153 for the first wicket as Sehwag scored an imperious 146 off just 102 balls studded with 17 fours and six sixes.\n\nIndia reached an imposing 414/7 off their 50 overs and Sri Lanka were staring down the barrel.\n\nDilshan and Upul Tharanga repeated the feat of the Indian openers and put on 188 for the first wicket. Kumar Sangakkara continued the good work and scored 90 off just 43 balls and at one stage the Lankans looked like they would win in a canter.\n\nSri Lanka needed 99 off 81 balls with eight wickets in hand. However, they committed hara-kiri and snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. They lost three wickets to run-outs in the last 11 balls as India won the high scoring bout by three runs. Sehwag was adjudged the Man of the Match.\n\nIndia vs Sri Lanka, ODI series Final, Queens Park Oval, Port of Spain, Trinidad, 11th July 2013\n\nAfter the Champions Trophy triumph, India set a date with the Islanders in the final of a tri-series where the hosts West Indies crashed out. After missing out the initial stages due to injury, MS Dhoni was back for the final.\n\nElecting to field first, the Indian bowlers applied brakes on the Sri Lankan batting. Only Kumar Sangakkara and Lahiru Thirimanne made substantial contributions as Sri Lanka scored a below par 201 all out.\n\nIn reply, Rohit Sharma led the way with a brilliant 58 as India made a cautious start. However, a collapse saw them reeling at 167/8 with Dhoni and Vinay Kumar at the crease.\n\nDhoni was content to just work the ball around and Vinay gave him adequate support. The ninth wicket fell at 182 and the last man Ishant Sharma joined Dhoni at the crease.\n\nDhoni sealed the match in style hitting Shaminda Eranga for six, four and six off the first three deliveries of the last over to seal India's triumph.\n\nThis prompted Ian Bishop to exclaim 'Magnificent Mahendra' on commentary.\n\nOne hopes that the matches in this ODI series are as exciting and spectator riveting as the matches above.\n\nThe author tweets @ravivenkat007\n\nSEARCH", "id": "9641377", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Great one-day encounters between India and Sri Lanka  ",

Sri Lanka are placed eighth with 88 points, 10 points more than the West Indies team, which has an unenviable task in its aim of being among the seven top-ranked sides apart from host England to gain

the Windies will at best reach 88 points even if it wins its one-off ODI against Ireland on September 13 as well as all five matches of its series in England from September 19-29.\n\nHowever, a 4-1 win for India will see Sri Lanka finish at 88 points and the Caribbean side could edge it on decimal points if they win all their upcoming six matches.\n\nThe West Indies side will go out of contention if it loses to Ireland as from there it will at best reach 86 points and remain behind Sri Lanka on decimal points, even if Sri Lanka lose 0-5 to India.\n\n(This article has not been edited

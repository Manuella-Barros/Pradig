A California mom who went viral for her rant about grocery store shopping carts was invited to make her point for viewers on KTLA 5 Weekend Morning News on Saturday, reaffirming her controversial stance that returning buggies isn\u2019t worth her time. \u201cI\u2019m not returning my shopping cart, and you can judge me all you want,\u201d said Leslie Dobson, a Los Angeles-based psychologist, in a May 29 post on TikTok, which has earned nearly 12 million views. \u201cI\u2019m not getting my groceries into my car and getting my children into the car and then leaving them in the car.\u201d \u201cSo, if you\u2019re going to give me a dirty look, f*** off,\u201d Dobson concluded in her 17-second message, ostensibly recorded from the driver\u2019s seat of her car while parked after a supermarket run. In a follow-up video published May 31, she doubled down on her hot take, claiming that 265 children were abducted from parking lots last year with half also being sexually assaulted. Her data appeared to be lifted from research by the nonprofit Kids and Car Safety, referring to the number of kids who happen to be in the car during attempted vehicle thefts. Many viewers weren\u2019t sympathetic to Dobson\u2019s logic. \u201cSomehow all of us other moms manage to return the cart,\u201d one rebuked. \u201cAnd some have the most horrific stories I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d said Dobson \u2014 seemingly intimating that she knows families who have experienced a parking lot abduction firsthand. \u201cThe point is, trust your intuition not judgments of others. I hope you never experience the pain I\u2019ve seen.\u201d Many viewers were insulted by the working mother\u2019s seemingly \u201clazy\u201d and \u201centitled\u201d behavior and labeled her a \u201cKaren.\u201d \u201cMom of a 6-year-old, 3-year-old and 9-month-old. I simply unload groceries, return cart WITH kids, and then load them in. Same way that we got out of car. Simple,\u201d wrote on disapproving parent on Dobson\u2019s initial clip. On the local morning news programs, anchors Megan Telles and Lauren Lyster \u2014 both also mothers \u2014 to discuss Dobson\u2019s stance and the subsequent backlash, including death threats and doxxing. Said Dobson of the response, \u201cI am shocked, but I am also very happy, because I\u2019ve received hundreds \u2014 maybe to the point of even thousands \u2013 of messages from moms saying, \u2018I pulled into the spot, I\u2019m looking at my surroundings and I\u2019m more aware now.\u2019 I know the video was provocative, but that\u2019s what I wanted\u2026I wanted to grab attention. It\u2019s the bigger picture of \u2018We need to empower ourselves to trust our intuitions\u2019.\u201d She continued to describe how the plights of parenthood are \u201cminimized\u2019 by society \u2014 as even loading little ones into the car can be a struggle. \u201cComing from the mindset of someone who has worked with predators for 20 years, I know how they think, and I know what they look for, and that is a vulnerable moment,\u201d she said \u201cWhen you return to your car, you have already been watched for a significant amount of time, so if you are choosing social niceties over protecting your children, I just wanted to say that you don\u2019t have to.\u201d Dobson reiterated that her opinion was rooted in child safety and protecting the helpless from predators. \u201cWe have taken power back from predators because now, this is a worldwide conversation, which I am shocked by,\u201d she said. \u201cBut honestly, if we have awareness, then that predator isn\u2019t going to be able to do what he intended.\u201d Dobson also conceded that she in fact does return the buggy on occasion. \u201cI always return my shopping cart, but if I don\u2019t feel safe and my kids are in the car, they are my priority,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m putting it somewhere safe and prioritizing the safety of my kids.\u201d", "summary": "She's really buggin'.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/09/lifestyle/mom-with-viral-hot-take-about-shopping-carts-appears-on-news-program/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/COMP-Screenshot-2024-06-03-at-82755-AM.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:39:18", "author": "Hannah Sparks", "authors": ["Hannah Sparks"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.161}

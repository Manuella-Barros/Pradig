Human rights groups and -politicians have demanded urgent action after the former intelligence agency operative Alagie Morr was traced to a flat in the city. Also known as Edrissa Jobe, he was a senior figure in the -government of brutal Gambian president Yahya Jammeh, whose 22-year reign was characterised by extreme violence, arrests, political -disappearances and murder. Government investigations have linked Morr to the beatings, sexual assaults and electrocution of detainees under his control, the Sunday Mail reports.

But speaking at his flat in the east end of Glasgow, Morr said: \u201cIt\u2019s not safe for me to go home. I will be killed or I will kill somebody.\u201d Morr has been living in Glasgow for several years in the Barlanark area while an asylum application is considered. Last year he was charged under the Abusive -Behaviour and Sexual Harm Act in -connection with an incident in which he was accused of pursuing his partner or ex-partner into a lane close to his home and kicking her in March last year. The charges were later deserted by the Procurator Fiscal and no further action was taken. Police Scotland and the Crown Office are understood to be -considering information about Morr\u2019s alleged crimes in Gambia to decide whether to take action here which could involve an extradition. Gambia\u2019s Truth Reconciliation and Reparations Commission (TRRC) named Morr was a high-ranking agent in the president\u2019s National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and Drug Law Enforcement Agency (DLEAG). The commission\u2019s reports repeatedly name him in -connection with -sickening incidents in which detainees reported being stripped naked, handcuffed, beaten and sexually assaulted. Reed Brody, an international war crimes prosecutor and spokesman for Human Rights Watch in Brussels, said: \u201cEdrissa Jobe, or Alagie Morr as he is also known, was a close -associate of Yahya Jammeh. \u201cHe has been credibly implicated in multiple cases of torture in Gambia where the Truth Commission has called for his prosecution. \u201cOne way or another, in Scotland or Gambia, Alagie Morr should be brought to justice.\u201d Join Glasgow Live's WhatsApp community here and get the latest news sent straight to your messages When the Sunday Mail confronted Morr at his Glasgow home, the dad of two insisted he was not the -\u201cdecision maker\u201d in Jammeh\u2019s government. Refusing to direct his answers to the reporter, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve been here for seven years. I\u2019ve had four or five interviews with the Home Office and no response on my asylum -application. I know nothing about an extradition. I love this place. \u201cTalk of human rights violations, it hurts me. I was not the decision maker in that government. -Interrogation was not under my care. \u201cMy job was to take statement and compile files to be passed to the prosecutors to make a decision on if they would have a case. \u201cI was trying to impose justice for my country and globally. \u201cThe people who are accusing me of human rights violations and torture were people who were arrested and taken to court. \u201cThe people involved in making these alleged human rights allegations know what they are doing. \u201cThey know as soon as you are accused of alleged human rights violations and torture they know your asylum claim is done.\u201d Sign up to our daily Glasgow Live newsletter here to receive news and features direct to your inbox Morr said his children are elsewhere and wife died four years ago. He added: \u201cI don\u2019t know where my wife is buried or why she died. I will not live with my family feeling threatened as I was doing the right thing. \u201cAs long as the government -officials and cartel are conspiring, my life is not safe. \u201cWhy are they after only me? There were 70 names but people who are still in my country have not been arrested.\u201d Morr lives in a flat filled with gym equipment. Neighbours had no idea who he was, with one saying they thought he was a night worker. The 6ft 4in warlord enforcer also chased a photographer in the street. Alba MSP and former justice secretary Kenny MacAskill said: \u201cThe case highlights just how ridiculous the UK Government\u2019s approach to asylum and immigration is, that the Home Office is obsessing over small boats and sending people to Rwanda, and meanwhile we are doing nothing about this man. \u201cIt is unbelievable that he has been arrested in Scotland, then the Crown Office have just let him walk free, from what I can see. By all accounts he should be in the International Criminal Court in The Hague.\u201d A spokesperson for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service said it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d to comment \u201cat this time\u201d.", "summary": "Human rights groups and \u00adpoliticians have demanded urgent action after the former intelligence agency operative Alagie Morr was traced to a flat in the city.", "url": "https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/gambian-warlords-torture-enforcer-found-29279287", "image": "https://i2-prod.glasgowlive.co.uk/incoming/article29279918.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screenshot-2024-06-02-at-125440.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:07:28", "author": "Jennifer Hyland,John Ferguson", "authors": ["Jennifer Hyland", "John Ferguson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.362}

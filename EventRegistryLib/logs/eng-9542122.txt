Colorado cruised to a 4-1 first-round victory over the Winnipeg Jets.\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\nThe Stars, as the Western Conference regular season champions, have home-ice advantage, meaning they'll host Games 1 and 2 as well as Games 5 and 7 (if necessary) at American Airlines Center.\n\nSports Roundup\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe series will start Tuesday, with Game 1 scheduled to begin at 8:30 p.m. Game 2 will start at 8:30 p.m. Thursday.\n\nHere are five things to know about the Stars' second-round matchup:\n\nAdvertisementA pivotal playoff foe\n\nThe Stars have never reached the Stanley Cup Final without going through the Colorado Avalanche. In five postseason meetings, the Stars hold the 3-2 advantage with wins in the 1998-99 season, 1999-2000 season and 2019-20 season.\n\nTheir most recent meeting was in the second round of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoff bubble when the Stars won in seven games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDallas' three wins all required a Game 7. Colorado's two wins were decided in only five games in 2003-04 and 2005-06.\n\nAdvertisementRecord doesn't tell whole story\n\nAs division opponents, the Stars and Avalanche met four times in the regular season and Colorado won the series 3-1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorado won the first three meetings -- two of which were blowouts -- while Dallas came away with arguably its best win of the season on April 7 by a 7-4 margin on the road. That win was key in clinching both the Central Division and Western Conference titles.\n\nThe circumstances in which the Stars faced the Avalanche this season were not easy. Dallas' two road games came on the second night of a back-to-back, and the second home game Jan. 4 was the night Miro Heiskanen collided with Scott Wedgewood and was injured in the third period, leading Dallas to blow a two-goal lead with 10 minutes to play in a 5-4 overtime loss.\n\nThe Stars won't have to worry about back-to-backs in the playoffs. Colorado's Ball Arena is a difficult environment in which to play, but the Stars will start the series at home as the higher seed.\n\nAvalanche started playoffs hot\n\nThe Avalanche lead the NHL this postseason with a whopping 5.6 goals per game. While most other teams saw their goal average decrease in the playoffs, Colorado's soared. The Avalanche also managed to do so against Winnipeg -- one of the best defensive teams in the league with Vezina front-runner Connor Hellebuyck in net.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are led by forward Nathan MacKinnon, who finished second in the race for the Art Ross Trophy with 140 points in the regular season. He already has nine postseason points (two goals, seven assists) in just five games.\n\nTwo other Avalanche players also have nine points -- forward Mikko Rantanen and defenseman Cale Makar, a finalist for this year's Norris Trophy.\n\nOn the flip side, the Avalanche allowed 3.0 goals per game, which is the highest among teams advancing to the second round.\n\nAdvertisementColorado enters series fresh\n\nThe Colorado-Winnipeg series was projected to be the toughest first-round matchup in the league with many assuming it would require seven games.\n\nHowever, Colorado closed it out in five, ending Winnipeg's season on Tuesday.\n\nWith the Stars-Avalanche series starting Tuesday, Colorado will have a full week off the ice by the time the series gets going. That's a rare break in the postseason and it allows the players to be well-rested entering the Dallas series.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt may not be the worst situation if the Stars have to jump into another series. After having nearly a week off following their last regular season game, the Stars dropped two straight to Vegas at home to start the playoffs.\n\nThe quick turnaround could allow Dallas to build on its four-game win streak and Colorado to cool off from its hot start offensively.\n\nFamiliar faces on both sides\n\nA handful of Stars and Avalanche players will reunite with their former teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the Stars, Matt Duchene will return to where he began his NHL career. The first-year Dallas forward spent 8.5 seasons in Colorado from 2009-18. It was the longest stop of his career before playing for Ottawa, Columbia, Nashville and now Dallas.\n\nOn Colorado's side, Joel Kiviranta, Valeri Nichushkin and Andrew Cogliano will all return to Dallas.\n\nKiviranta left most recently, as he was a part of Dallas' Western Conference finals roster last season. He played four total years in Dallas. Nichushkin started his career with the Stars, spending four various years with the team from 2013-19. Cogliano was in Dallas for three seasons from 2018-21.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreStars' Jake Oettinger is ready for next challenge.

But the Stars, after nine shots on net in the first period, had only seven combined the rest of regulation, and six in overtime.\n\nStars goalie Jake Oettinger stopped 22 shots, ending his six-game streak of allowing two goals or less.\n\nDallas jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first period against the 2022 Stanley Cup champion, only two nights after wrapping up a seven-game series against Vegas, last year's champ, in which both teams finished with 16 goals and the margin was never more than two goals.\n\nJamie Benn had a goal and an assist for the Stars, who lost their series opener at home like in the first round when they dropped the first two games. Ryan Sutter and Wyatt Johnston also scored goals.\n\nGame 2 is Thursday night.\n\nAP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_hawkins@eagletribune.com", "name": "Stephen Hawkins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Benn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Benn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artturi_Lehkonen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artturi Lehkonen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miles Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miro_Heiskanen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miro Heiskanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/b6/3b67e793-de36-5002-88cf-2e946ff52dd6/663b0a7322f45.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Dallas Stars host the Colorado Avalanche in a pivotal Game 2 of their Western Conference semifinal series on Thursday night. The puck drops at 9:30 p.m. ET from the American Airlines Center in Dallas, with the game televised nationally on TNT.\n\nThe Stars are favored at -135 odds, implying a 57.4% probability of evening the series at one game apiece. The Avalanche are +114 underdogs after their incredible comeback from down 3-0 to win Game 1 by a 4-3 score in overtime.\n\nAvalanche vs Stars Prediction\n\nWe've made our Avalanche vs Stars prediction for Game 2, riding with the home team to even the series 1-1.\n\nMy Game 2 Best Bets\n\nI'm backing the Stars to bounce back and win Game 2 on home ice. While the Avalanche's offensive firepower is impressive, averaging 5.33 goals per game in the playoffs, the Stars can't afford to go down 0-2 in the series before it shifts to Colorado.\n\nLook for Stars coach Pete DeBoer to make the necessary adjustments to slow down Nathan MacKinnon, Cale Makar and the potent Avalanche attack that has scored at least four goals in all six of their playoff games. The Stars need to play a full 60 minutes of strong defensive hockey in front of goalie Jake Oettinger.\n\nAt the other end, the Stars' top offensive players like Roope Hintz, Joe Pavelski, Jamie Benn and Tyler Seguin must step up and generate more scoring chances. That group was relatively quiet in Game 1 outside of Benn's two early points.\n\nIf the Stars can stay out of the penalty box and not allow the Avalanche's lethal power play (44% in playoffs) to get rolling, they have a great chance to even the series. Dallas was one of the best defensive teams in the regular season, allowing just 2.62 goals per game.\n\nLay the short moneyline price with the Stars in a virtual must-win spot. The Avalanche's comeback in Game 1 was impressive, but it's tough to see them going up 2-0 in a series against a team that was neck-and-neck with them in the regular season standings. Back the Stars to get the job done.\n\nThe Stars are -135 moneyline favorites, while the Avalanche are +115 underdogs. The total is set at 6.5 goals, with the under juiced to -122 odds. That implies a 55% probability of six goals or fewer being scored.\n\nA key reason the Stars are favored in this series is their superior depth and the goaltending edge with Oettinger over the Avs' Alexandar Georgiev. If they can get back to their stingy defensive structure and generate more offensive zone time, the Stars should be able to even this series on home ice.\n\nThe Avalanche's high-flying offense makes the over tempting, but look for the Stars to clamp down defensively in a must-win spot. Dallas likely can't win a track meet against Colorado, so expect a tighter-checking, lower-scoring affair.\n\nCOL - DAL Player Props\n\nColorado vs Dallas player props are available, with Nathan MacKinnon being the odds-on favorite to score at -115 odds.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen Over 2.5 shots (-115 via DraftKings)\n\nLehkonen is averaging 3.7 shots per game in the playoffs and has gone over 2.5 shots in four of six contests. He's due for a resurgent shooting performance after being held to one and two shots in his last two games.\n\nJamie Benn Over 0.5 points (-115 via BetMGM):\n\nThe Stars captain had two points in the first 17 minutes of Game 1 and has four points in four regular-season games against the Avalanche this year. Benn needs another solid performance for Dallas to avoid a 2-0 series deficit.\n\nAvalanche vs Stars Injury Report\n\nThe Avalanche will be without several key players for Game 2 and likely the rest of the series:\n\nDrouin's absence in particular takes away some scoring depth for Colorado. However, the Avs' incredible top-end talent has stepped up to carry the offensive load.\n\nOn the Stars side, defenseman Jani Hakanpaa remains out indefinitely with a lower-body injury. Forwards Mason Marchment (undisclosed) and Jerad Rosburg (undisclosed) are also sidelined. The bigger concern for Dallas is the heavy workload being given to their top defensemen.\n\nThe Stars are playing Nils Lundkvist less than five minutes per game, which could lead to fatigue for Miro Heiskanen, Esa Lindell and others as the series progresses, especially after a long seven-game series against Vegas.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports

Today, NHL.com previews the Western Conference Second Round between the Dallas Stars and Colorado Avalanche.\n\nThe Dallas Stars will play the Colorado Avalanche for the sixth time in the Stanley Cup Playoffs when they face off in the Western Conference Second Round.\n\nThe last postseason meeting between the Stars and Avalanche was the 2020 second round, won by Dallas in seven games en route to the Stanley Cup Final, a six-game loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nAfter losing their first two games at home, the Stars defeated the Golden Knights in four of the next five, including 2-1 in Game 7. It was a reversal of last year when Vegas eliminated Dallas from the Western Conference Final in six games and went on to win the Stanley Cup.\n\nThe Stars don't have much time to rest before the second round begins, but they're prepared.\n\n\"We've got a plan and at least we're starting at home,\" coach Pete DeBoer said. \"We've earned the right to have home-ice advantage. I think it would've been tougher had we had to travel to Colorado (on Monday) to start on the road.\n\n\"I think that home ice and getting the first seed in the conference is going to be helpful, but it's going to be a quick turnaround. We're probably going to struggle with some fatigue at different points, but we have some depth, and we'll see how it goes.\n\nThe Avalanche lost Game 1 to the Jets before winning the next four to advance. They feel much better about where they are compared to last year, when they lost the first round in seven games to the Seattle Kraken.\n\nCoach Jared Bednar credited the Avalanche's acquisitions prior to the 2024 NHL Trade Deadline as one reason. They got center Casey Mittelstadt from the Buffalo Sabres, defenseman Sean Walker from the Philadelphia Flyers, and forwards Brandon Duhaime from the Minnesota Wild and Yakov Trenin from the Nashville Predators.\n\n\"The additions at the Deadline rejuvenated our team because we filled some needs that we had and made our team stronger depth wise,\" Bednar said. \"The defensive aspect of the games, some size and strength things. Once that happened at the Deadline, our team was really focused on opportunity ahead of us and they did a nice job getting ready to play for Round One. I'm not so sure it was in last year's playoffs, though.\"\n\nStars: Wyatt Johnston continues to build off an impressive second season in the NHL (65 points; 32 goals, 33 assists in 82 games). The forward plays like a veteran and comes up in big moments, including the overtime goal in a 3-2 win in Game 3 against the Golden Knights and the opening goal in Game 7. Johnston led the Stars through the first round with seven points (four goals, three assists) in seven games.\n\nAvalanche: You have to go with Nathan MacKinnon again. Though other players scored more goals in the first round, MacKinnon is still the one who opponents want and need to shut down the most. He had nine points (two goals, seven assists) against the Jets, tied for the Avalanche lead with linemate Mikko Rantanen and defenseman Cale Makar, each of whom also had two goals and seven assists.\n\nStars: Jake Oettinger was great in a tight first-round series, going 4-3 with a 1.95 goals-against average and .925 save percentage. The Stars went 16-4 in their final 20 regular-season games, when Oettinger was 13-3-0 with a 2.26 GAA, .913 save percentage and two shutouts in 16 starts. He returned to form as the regular season ended and he's carried that over to the postseason.\n\nAvalanche: Alexandar Georgiev had a forgettable start to the playoffs but it's how you finish, right? He rebounded from a 7-6 loss in Game 1 to win his next four, is 4-1 with a 3.03 GAA and .900 save percentage and didn't allow more than three goals in a game after the opener. Backup Justus Annunen is healthy again after missing the first two games with an illness.\n\nStars: Joe Pavelski (8-3) and DeBoer (8-0) both matched the NHL record for career Game 7 wins shared by six skaters (Brad Richards, 8-0; Ray Bourque, 8-1; Justin Williams, 8-1; Carl Hagelin, 8-2; Ryan McDonagh, 8-2; and Glenn Anderson, 8-4) and one coach (Darryl Sutter, 8-3).\n\nAvalanche: They are the fourth team in NHL history to score at least five goals in each of their first five games of the playoffs. The 1985 Chicago Blackhawks (seven) and 1994 New York Rangers (six) are the only teams with a longer run.\n\nStars: Logan Stankoven was held to two assists in the first round but had a crucial game-tying assist in the first period of Game 5, 1:02 after Vegas took a 1-0 lead. The 21-year-old could be a key secondary scorer against the Avalanche whether he plays center or wing. Stankoven ranked second among NHL rookies who played at least 12 regular-season games with 0.58 points per game (14 in 24 games), behind Blackhawks forward Connor Bedard (0.90), and had two points (one goal, one assist) and four shots on goal in two games against Colorado. -- Pete Jensen\n\nAvalanche: Artturi Lehkonen scored in all five games against the Jets and ranks second on Colorado in goals behind Valeri Nichushkin (seven). He's also tied with teammate Casey Mittelstadt for the fourth-most even-strength points (six) in the playoffs and is second on the Avalanche behind Rantanen (seven). Lehkonen is consistently a solid playoff performer; he had six points (three goals, three assists) in seven games last postseason and 14 points (eight goals, six assists) in 20 games when the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup in 2022. He's a big part of the top power-play unit with high-scoring skaters MacKinnon, Rantanen, Nichushkin and Makar. -- Anna Dua\n\n\"I mean, if those were the five best in the season, our next five are going to have to be even better. That's the way the playoffs go. You have to keep getting better and better each round. For us, it's definitely going to have to happen but in terms of the break, you can look at it both ways. But you have to stay ready as a group and make sure we practice and do the right things.\" -- Avalanche defenseman Cale Makar\n\n\"I think it's going to be a totally different style of hockey. We felt like we played well against them in the regular season. Obviously that last game of the year we played them, we felt like we played a great game against them. We should feel confident in what we just did. We showed we can play that way or more of an up-tempo game, (which) I'm guessing we'll be getting from (the Avalanche). A couple of adjustments and let's roll.\" -- Stars goalie Jake Oettinger\n\nStars: They remain stingy on defense. Outside of Game 1, when the Golden Knights scored four goals, the Stars held them to three or fewer in the next six games, not easy to do against the defending Stanley Cup champions. They're allowing 2.29 goals per game (fifth in the playoffs) and will need that same type of defense against the Avalanche, who lead the postseason with 5.60 goals per game.\n\nAvalanche: They keep the balanced scoring going. Colorado got contributions across the board and not just from their top line of Nichushkin, MacKinnon and Rantanen. Six players have at least six points. You need depth scoring at this time of year and it paid off for the Avalanche in the first round. It's something they'll need to continue if they're going to keep advancing.\n\nValeri Nichushkin -- Nathan MacKinnon -- Mikko Rantanen\n\nArtturi Lehkonen -- Casey Mittelstadt -- Zach Parise",

Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche and Dallas Stars play Game 1 of their Western Conference Semi-Finals matchup on Tuesday night at American Airlines Center. Puck drop is at 9:30 pm ET, with ESPN carrying the broadcast.\n\nThe Stars, who eliminated the Vegas Golden Knights in seven games in the first round, are slight -125 favorites at home. The Avalanche, who knocked off the Winnipeg Jets in five games, come in as +106 underdogs. The over/under for the game is set at 6.5 goals.\n\nHere's our Avs vs Stars prediction for Tuesday night, along with betting odds and player prop picks.\n\nAvalanche vs Stars Prediction\n\nBoth teams are coming off impressive first-round victories, but in very different ways. The Avalanche dominated the Jets, outscoring them 28-14 over the five-game series. Colorado's offense was firing on all cylinders, led by Nathan MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen, and Cale Makar, who each tallied two goals and seven assists.\n\nThe Avalanche also got significant contributions from depth players like Valeri Nichushkin (seven goals) and Artturi Lehkonen (five goals).\n\nThe Stars, on the other hand, had to battle back from a 2-0 series deficit against the Golden Knights. Dallas leaned on their strong defensive play and goaltending from Jake Oettinger to win four of the next five games. Oettinger posted an impressive 1.95 GAA and a .925 save percentage in the series.\n\nIn the regular season, the Avalanche won three of the four meetings between these two teams, but the Stars claimed the top seed in the West with 113 points, six more than Colorado.\n\nGiven the offensive firepower on both rosters, this series has the potential to be relatively high-scoring. However, with Oettinger's strong goaltending and the Stars' defensive shutdown ability, we predict Game 1 to be a tighter-checking affair as both teams look to establish their game plan.\n\nThe Stars are currently favored to win Game 1 with a moneyline of -125, while the Avalanche are underdogs at +105. This means that a $125 bet on the Stars would return $100 in profit, while a $100 bet on the Avalanche would return $105 in profit.\n\nThe implied probability of these odds suggests that the Stars have a 56% chance of winning the game, while the Avalanche have a 48.5% chance.\n\nThe Stars are favored due to their home-ice advantage and their strong defensive play in the first round. The Avalanche, despite their impressive offensive display against the Jets, are underdogs on the road against an elite defensive team that allowed the fewest goals in the regular season.\n\nAvalanche vs Stars Player Props\n\nIn the NHL player props market, Nathan MacKinnon has the best odds to find twine at -115. While Nate Dogg is the only odds-on favorite to score, Mikko Rantanen (+125) and Valeri Nichushkin (+145) also have favorable odds to light the lamp.\n\nHere are a couple of player props to consider for Game 1:\n\nWyatt Johnston (Stars) Over 0.5 points (-140):\n\nJohnston led the Stars with four goals and three assists in the first round and has been playing on the top line. He has a good chance to continue his strong play against the Avalanche.\n\nCale Makar (Avalanche) Over 0.5 points (-150):\n\nMakar is one of the best offensive defensemen in the league and tallied two goals and seven assists in the first round. He should be involved in the Avalanche's offensive attack in the series opener.\n\nAvalanche vs Stars Injury Report\n\nThe Avalanche are relatively healthy coming into this series, with only forward Jonathan Drouin listed as out with a lower-body injury. Colorado should benefit from the additional rest they received after their first-round victory.\n\nFor the Stars, forwards Mason Marchment and Jani Hakanpaa are listed as day-to-day. Coach Peter DeBoer said he hopes both could return at some point in this series.\n\nOverall, both teams are in good shape injury-wise heading into Game 1.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brady_trettenero@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Brady Trettenero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artturi_Lehkonen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artturi Lehkonen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Johnston", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyatt Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Marchment", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mason Marchment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jani_Hakanp\u00e4\u00e4", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jani Hakanp\u00e4\u00e4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Drouin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Drouin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_20145130.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

That's where Miles Wood secured Colorado's win with 8:57 remaining in the first overtime period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere are five thoughts from the Stars' 4-3 overtime loss in Game 1:\n\nAdvertisementStars can't expand on recent overtime success\n\nThe Stars struggled in overtime last year, going 8-14 past regulation in the regular season and 1-4 in the playoffs.\n\nSports Roundup\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThey improved their regular-season overtime record to 12-9 this year and got off to a strong start in the playoffs when Wyatt Johnston scored the game-winner in extra time in Game 3 against the Golden Knights.\n\nBut Dallas couldn't build off that first win, losing in its second overtime game of the postseason. Wood scored on a breakaway midway through the overtime period.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiven how tight the series is expected to be -- and how competitive it was in Game 1 -- these teams may return to overtime at some point in the next six games.\n\nStars' struggles to put Colorado away continue\n\nIn multiple regular-season matchups between the Stars and Avalanche, Colorado managed to overcome huge deficits to either take a lead or bring the game within one goal late.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their first meeting back in November, the Stars took a 3-0 lead early in the second period before the Avalanche scored six straight to win the game 6-3. In their next meeting in January, Dallas held a two-goal lead with 10 minutes remaining before Colorado managed to tie it and win on an overtime goal by Nathan MacKinnon. In the final meeting in April, the Stars led 5-2 before Colorado closed the gap to 5-4. Dallas was able to pull out the win with two late goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTuesday's Game 1 told a similar story, as the Stars held a 3-0 lead by the first intermission. Ryan Suter and Wyatt Johnston scored in the first 11 minutes before Jamie Benn added a 5-on-3 goal.\n\nDespite the early hole, Colorado used its power play to climb back into the game, scoring two goals on the man-advantage in the first 9:08 of the second period to pull within one. MacKinnon scored just 39 seconds into the third period on a rebound to tie it.\n\nAvalanche power play as lethal as advertised\n\nThe Avalanche had the fifth-best power play in the league in the regular season, connecting on 24.5% of their attempts. With elite players like MacKinnon and Cale Makar leading that group, the Stars knew they'd have to stay off the penalty kill to neutralize that advantage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Dallas was successful in avoiding penalties early, it took two poor ones early in the second period -- a slashing call on Evgenii Dadonov and a hooking call on Craig Smith with no one around behind Colorado's net.\n\nColorado scored on its first two man-advantage opportunities of the series. Former Star Valeri Nichushkin scored on a rebound before Makar's shot from the point made it 3-2 midway through the period.\n\nDallas had a power-play goal of its own, as Benn scored on the 5-on-3 late in the first period. Dallas struggled to score on the 5-on-3 all season, only recording its first goal with that advantage in Game 81, but was able to do so on its first attempt in the playoffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Stars finished 1 for 4 on the power play.\n\nSpecial teams could be a big momentum-shifter in the series, and the Stars will need to do all they can to keep Colorado at even strength.\n\nColorado's star power poses early challenge\n\nDallas knew the challenge on its hands facing some of the league's top players on Colorado's roster. MacKinnon was named a Hart Trophy finalist Tuesday morning for the league's MVP award. Makar was named a Norris Trophy finalist for the league's top defenseman.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorado's top players played key roles in helping their team claw back into the game after trailing 3-0 early. Top-line forward Nichushkin had the first goal and an assist. Makar had the next goal and an assist. And MacKinnon tied it up off a rebound.\n\nThe Stars didn't have an answer for those three in Game 1 as they took control of the game. They'll need to find one later in the series.\n\nShift in goaltending from first series\n\nBoth Dallas' and Vegas' goaltending in the first round dictated much of the series, as Jake Oettinger, Logan Thompson and Adin Hill were phenomenal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first glimpse of Dallas' second-round matchup with Colorado indicated a shift in the role goaltenders would play in the series.\n\nDallas entered with a significant advantage in net, as Avalanche goalie Alexandar Georgiev had a rocky first series against Winnipeg. He allowed seven goals in Game 1 against Winnipeg and got off to a rough start against Dallas as well, giving up three goals on the first nine shots he faced.\n\nFrom there, Dallas had just seven shots in the remainder of regulation. Meanwhile, Oettinger went from facing five shots in the first to 17 in the next two periods where he let in three. He allowed four goals overall on 26 shots.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreLive updates: Avs recover from 3-0 deficit to beat Stars 4-3 in overtimeDallas, Denver mayors place 'Texas-style' bet on

(Cogliano) gets his eyes up and Wood was fresh and went slashing through their D,\" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"When Woody get's going like that, he's hard to stop. He's fast and he's powerful, and he just took it to the house.\"\n\nStaying ahead of defenseman Miro Heiskanen, Wood got the puck around Jake Oettinger to wrap up only the Avalanche's third three-goal comeback to win a playoff game in their history -- and first since 1997.\n\n\"There's a scrum in the corner there. ... I was just screaming 'Chip, chip, chip.' He made a great play, and from there on out, I just used my speed,\" said Wood, still breathing heavily from the game-winning play. \"I definitely kicked it into high gear there.\"\n\nCale Makar had a goal and two assists for Colorado, while Valerie Nichushkin had a goal and an assist. Nathan MacKinnon had the tying goal only 39 seconds into the third period when left open just to the left of the net, and Mikko Rantanen, who had two assists, had a shot off the post midway through the third period.\n\n\"It would have been easy to kind of fold after that first period,\" MacKinnon said. \"But we felt like we were playing better than what the score showed. We wanted to see it through\"\n\nAlexander Georgiev had 19 saves while winning his fifth consecutive start in goal for the Avs. But Dallas, after nine shots on net in the first period, had only seven combined the rest of regulation, and six in overtime when he denied Tyler Seguin twice in less than a minute and knocked down a couple of long high shots by Thomas Harley.\n\n\"He's been playing great for us. We're all so pumped for him,\" Wood said of the goalie. \"He let in three there in the first quickly, but he was solid from there on out.\"\n\nStars goalie Oettinger stopped 22 shots, ending his six-game streak of allowing two goals or less.\n\nDallas led 3-0 in the first period against the 2022 Stanley Cup champion, only two nights after wrapping up a seven-game series against Vegas, last year's champ, in which both teams finished with 16 goals and the margin was never more than two goals.\n\n\"It's a tough turnaround for us as a group. I thought we had a great start,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. \"The fatigue from Game 7 I thought hit us in the second half of that game.\"\n\nJamie Benn had a goal and an assist for the Stars, who lost their series opener at home like in the first round when they dropped the first two games. Ryan Sutter and Wyatt Johnston also scored goals.\n\nGame 2 is Thursday night.\n\nColorado scored 28 goals in five games against Winnipeg, and had gone a full week since wrapping that series up in five games. The Avs had three comeback wins against the Jets, but none of those were from more than one-goal deficits.\n\nIt wasn't the first time this season for the Avalanche to come back from a 3-0 deficit in Dallas. They were down that early in the second period back in November before scoring six unanswered goals in a 6-3 win.\n\n\"You can't take a breath with these guys,\" Benn said. \"They're a great team.\"\n\nColorado scored two power-play goals in the second period, with Nichushkin getting his eighth goal of the playoffs, and extending his goal-scoring streak this postseason to six games before assisting on Makar's goal that got them within 3-2.\n\nNichushkin, the 10th overall draft pick by Dallas in 2013, knocked in the loose puck after Makar had a shot off Oettinger that Ryan Suter was unable to clear. Makar did get a wrister from about 50 feet into the net on his next shot.\n\nSuter, the 39-year-old defenseman whose 1,444 career regular-season games are the most for any player without winning a Stanley Cup, put the Stars up 1-0 with a 60-footer from near the left boards only 7 1/2 minutes into the game. Georgiev never saw the puck because of all the traffic in front of the net after Suter got a pass from Matt Duchene, who had just gotten up from taking a hit.\n\nThe Stars made it 2-0 directly off a faceoff win by Benn, with the 20-year-old Johnston scoring from the top of the left circle for his fifth goal this postseason.\n\nDallas was on a 5-on-3 power play when Benn scored with three minutes left in the first period by deflected a flying puck into the net.\n\nAnd the Stars captain almost had another goal in the closing seconds on another power play. He made a nifty move and made a swiping shot while falling down to get the puck behind Georgiev before defenseman Josh Manson knocked it away from the goal line.\n\n___\n\nAP NHL playoffs:

That's where Miles Wood secured Colorado's win with 8:57 remaining in the first overtime period.\n\nHere are five thoughts from the Stars' 4-3 overtime loss in Game 1:\n\nStars can't expand on recent overtime success\n\nThe Stars struggled in overtime last year, going 8-14 past regulation in the regular season and 1-4 in the playoffs.\n\nThey improved their regular-season overtime record to 12-9 this year and got off to a strong start in the playoffs when Wyatt Johnston scored the game-winner in extra time in Game 3 against the Golden Knights.\n\nBut Dallas couldn't build off that first win, losing in its second overtime game of the postseason. Wood scored on a breakaway midway through the overtime period.\n\nGiven how tight the series is expected to be -- and how competitive it was in Game 1 -- these teams may return to overtime at some point in the next six games.\n\nStars' struggles to put Colorado away continue\n\nIn multiple regular-season matchups between the Stars and Avalanche, Colorado managed to overcome huge deficits to either take a lead or bring the game within one goal late.\n\nIn their first meeting back in November, the Stars took a 3-0 lead early in the second period before the Avalanche scored six straight to win the game 6-3. In their next meeting in January, Dallas held a two-goal lead with 10 minutes remaining before Colorado managed to tie it and win on an overtime goal by Nathan MacKinnon. In the final meeting in April, the Stars led 5-2 before Colorado closed the gap to 5-4. Dallas was able to pull out the win with two late goals.\n\nTuesday's Game 1 told a similar story, as the Stars held a 3-0 lead by the first intermission. Ryan Suter and Wyatt Johnston scored in the first 11 minutes before Jamie Benn added a 5-on-3 goal.\n\nDespite the early hole, Colorado used its power play to climb back into the game, scoring two goals on the man-advantage in the first 9:08 of the second period to pull within one. MacKinnon scored just 39 seconds into the third period on a rebound to tie it up.\n\nAvalanche power play as lethal as advertised\n\nThe Avalanche had the fifth-best power play in the league in the regular season, connecting on 24.5% of their attempts. With elite players like MacKinnon and Cale Makar leading that group, the Stars knew they'd have to stay off the penalty kill to neutralize that advantage.\n\nWhile Dallas was successful in avoiding penalties early, it took two poor ones early in the second period -- a slashing call on Evgenii Dadonov and a hooking call on Craig Smith with no one around behind Colorado's net.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nColorado scored on its first two man-advantages of the series. Former Star Valeri Nichushkin scored on a rebound before Makar's shot from the point made it 3-2 midway through the period.\n\nDallas had a power-play goal of its own, as Benn scored on the 5-on-3 late in the first period. Dallas struggled to score on the 5-on-3 all season, only recording its first goal with that advantage in Game 81, but was able to do so on its first attempt in the playoffs.\n\nThe Stars finished 1 for 4 on the power play.\n\nSpecial teams could be a big momentum-shifter in the series, and the Stars will need to do all they can to keep Colorado at even strength.\n\nColorado's star power poses early challenge\n\nDallas knew the challenge on its hands facing some of the league's top players on Colorado's roster. MacKinnon was named a Hart Trophy finalist Tuesday morning for the league's MVP award. Makar was named a Norris Trophy finalist for the league's top defenseman.\n\nColorado's top players played key roles in helping their team claw back into the game after trailing 3-0 early. Top-line forward Nichushkin had the first goal and an assist. Makar had the next goal and an assist. And MacKinnon tied it up off a rebound.\n\nThe Stars didn't have an answer for those three in Game 1 as they took control of the game. They'll need to find one later in the series.\n\nShift in goaltending from first series\n\nBoth Dallas' and Vegas' goaltending in the first round dictated much of the series, as Jake Oettinger, Logan Thompson and Adin Hill were phenomenal.\n\nThe first glimpse of Dallas' second-round matchup with Colorado indicated a shift in the role goaltenders would play in the series.\n\nDallas entered with a significant advantage in net, as Avalanche goalie Alexandar Georgiev had a rocky first series against Winnipeg. He allowed seven goals in Game 1 against Winnipeg and got off to a rough start against Dallas as well, giving up three goals on the first nine shots he faced.\n\nFrom there, Dallas had just seven shots in the remainder of regulation. Meanwhile, Oettinger went from facing five in the first to 17 in the next two periods where he let in three.\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News.

Unlock the DraftKings promo code to bet on Avalanche vs Stars in the postseason.\n\nAvalanche vs Stars Series Schedule\n\nThe Avalanche vs Stars playoff schedule has been released, with Game 1 kicking things off on Tuesday. Here's a look at the schedule, along with broadcast networks and start times.\n\nIn the 2023-24 regular season, the Avalanche had the upper hand against the Stars, winning three of their four meetings. Colorado outscored Dallas 20-15 over those four games, showcasing their offensive firepower. The Avalanche's victories included a 6-3 win in Dallas on November 18, 2023, and a 5-1 triumph in Colorado on February 27, 2024.\n\nHowever, the Stars refused to go down without a fight. In their lone win against the Avalanche on April 7, 2024, Dallas put on an impressive offensive display, securing a 7-4 victory in Colorado. This game highlighted the Stars' ability to match the Avalanche's high-scoring style of play.\n\nThe Stars and Avalanche last met in the playoffs during the 2020 postseason bubble. In a hard-fought second-round series, Dallas prevailed in seven games. The Stars' elite defensive play and timely scoring were key factors in their success against the high-powered Avalanche offense.\n\nAvs Dominate Jets\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche are surging into the second round of the 2024 NHL playoffs after an impressive showing against the Winnipeg Jets. The Avs eliminated the Jets in five games, bouncing back from a Game 1 loss to rattle off four straight victories\n\nColorado's star players shined in the first round. The dynamic trio of Cale Makar, Nathan MacKinnon, and Mikko Rantanen each tallied nine points, with Rantanen scoring the crucial go-ahead goals in the series-clinching Game 5.\n\nArtturi Lehkonen was a force, notching eight points including five goals. Valeri Nichushkin led the team with seven goals, proving to be a consistent offensive threat.\n\nBetween the pipes, Alexandar Georgiev was solid, starting all five games and posting a 4-1 record with a 3.03 goals-against average and .900 save percentage. After the Game 1 stumble, Georgiev settled in and gave his team a chance to win each night.\n\nThe Avalanche's high-powered offense was on full display against Winnipeg, as they scored 20 goals over the final four games. Their puck movement and creativity were top-notch, and they consistently generated high-danger scoring chances.\n\nHowever, there is still room for defensive improvement heading into Round 2, as they allowed three goals in each of the last three games against the Jets.\n\nAvs vs Series Prediction\n\nThe Avalanche appear to have found another gear in the postseason following a mediocre regular season. However, they likely won't find scoring as easy in this round as the previous round. The Stars are one of the league's best defensive teams and boast excellent advanced metrics.\n\nGoaltending is what ultimately cost the Avs in their last playoff series with Dallas, and it could play a vital role once again. As great as Georgiev has played lately, he was fairly inconsistent throughout the season and has limited postseason experience.\n\nOettinger, on the other hand, has played nearly double the number of playoff games as Georgiev and has a superior postseason save percentage (.918). Defense wins championships, and we think Dallas will be able to limit Colorado's stars enough to advance to Round 3.", "source": {"uri": "sportsbettingdime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Betting Dime"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brady_trettenero@sportsbettingdime.com", "name": "Brady Trettenero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHL Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artturi_Lehkonen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artturi Lehkonen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.sportsbettingdime.com/app/uploads/media/4/USATSI_22969260.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 886, "textEnd": 893}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-11-", "textStart": 1491, "textEnd": 1502}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Dallas' defense bailed their offense out, stymieing the opposition to just nine goals in five games.\n\nThe youthful play of Wyatt Johnson was the lifeline of their timely offense with four goals and three assists. He has tallied 27 shots on goal. Jason Robertson has chipped in three goals. If it goes deep, he ranks first in the Western Conference in shootout goals (4) this season.\n\nThe Stars will try to teeter away from a track meet, but they possess some afterburners. Timely, tense possessions will be their goal. They'll also be aware of Colorado's ability to manufacture chaos, including 16 tipped shots, which contributed to five goals in the last series.\n\nThe Stars offense is no slouch, finishing third in the NHL in scoring at 3.59 goals per game.\n\nTyler Sequin has scored at least one goal in each of his last four games against the Avalanche.\n\nJake Oettinger is expected to get the nod in front of the net. He has a 1.95 goals against average and a .925 save percentage from his first-round work. The Stars defense allows 2.86 goals per game.\n\nThey entered the postseason winners of 12 of their last 13 but that momentum has shifted. The Avalanche won the season series 3-1, including two victories in Dallas. Colorado averaged five goals a game in that playoff preview.\n\nAfter dropping their first game, Colorado is coming off four straight victories against the Winnipeg Jets. They last played on May 1. The Avalanche scored 28 goals in five games and only allowed eight goals in the series. It was a brief lapse, and then a burial.\n\nThey have smothered opponents in goals at times this season, and that's exactly what happened to the Jets, who entered the postseason with the best defense in the NHL. Colorado averaged a scintillating 5.60 goals per game in that series. The Avalanche entered the postseason first-place in the NHL in goals per game at 3.68.\n\nThey are paced by Nathan MacKinnon, Cale Makar and Mikko Rantanen, who each have nine points in the postseason. MacKinnon leads the NHL in multi-point games (44) this season. Valeri Nichushkin has scored seven goals. He has scored at least one goal in each of the last six games.\n\nGoalkeeper Alexander Georgiev anchors the net with a 3.03 goals against average and a .900 save percentage.\n\nCan Dallas keep up with the high-powered and well-rested Avalanche? Home ice could play a major role in this Western Conference clash. The Avalanche were just 19-16-6 on the road this season while the Stars went 26-11-4 at the friendly confines of the American Airlines Center.\n\nWith that being said, the Stars haven't won a Game 1 since the 2020 Stanley Cup Final.\n\nHere are more details about Avalanche vs. Stars Game 1 and how to watch it via various TV and streaming options:\n\nWhat: Dallas Stars vs. Colorado Avalanche, NHL

Not two. Not three. But six. That's how many consecutive Game 1s the Dallas Stars have lost after falling to the visiting Colorado Avalanche 4-3 in overtime Tuesday night in the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nThe Stars jumped to a 3-0 lead in the first period after goals from Ryan Suter, Wyatt Johnston and Jamie Benn only to then go scoreless the rest of the way and allow four straight goals by the Avalanche, including the winner from Miles Wood nearly nine minutes into overtime.\n\n\"We had that game under control, and we let it slip away. But we've seen that in the regular season against them,\" Stars forward Matt Duchene told reporters. \"We had two games like that, so we have bounce back here and split the homestand here.\"\n\nThe Avalanche jump-started their comeback by capitalizing on their power-play chances. Valeri Nichushkin trimmed the lead to 3-1 a little more than five minutes into the second period, and Cale Makar cut it to 3-2 nearly four minutes later.\n\nAvalanche star center Nathan MacKinnon, who was named one of the three Hart Trophy finalists on Tuesday, scored the tying goal less than a minute into the third period.\n\n\"They're a great power play,\" Benn said. \"They've got a lot of skill. We'll have to watch some video, learn from it and move on.\"\n\nThere were moments in overtime when the Avalanche struggled to find a clear shot before Wood found space on a breakaway and beat Stars goaltender Jake Oettinger for the winning goal.\n\n\"We didn't know we could come back, but we wanted to at least try,\" MacKinnon said after the game.\n\nLearning how to make the necessary adjustments following a Game 1 loss has proved to be a familiar theme for the Stars.\n\nThe last time they won Game 1 of a playoff series came in 2020, when they took the first game of the Stanley Cup Final against the Tampa Bay Lightning in a series Dallas would lose in six games.\n\nThe Stars opened the 2022 playoffs with a Game 1 loss to the Calgary Flames and fell in seven games. Last season saw the Stars open the playoffs with a Game 1 loss in double overtime in the first round to the Minnesota Wild before winning the series in six games. Dallas lost Game 1 of the second round in overtime to the Seattle Kraken before winning that series in seven games en route to reaching the Western Conference finals, where the Stars lost another Game 1 that went into overtime to the Vegas Golden Knights before dropping that series in six games.\n\nFast-forward to this year's playoffs: The Stars lost the first two games of their opening-round series to the Golden Knights before ousting the defending Stanley Cup champions in the first round. And now Dallas has pushed that streak to six straight Game 1 defeats with Tuesday's loss to the Avalanche.\n\n\"I think you learn about each other as a series goes on, and what we know about that team is what happened tonight,\" Stars coach Peter DeBoer said. \"I think we had the lead. ... They're a quick-strike team. You can't make mistakes in those situations.

I couldn't tell who popped the puck to (Cogliano), and I was just screaming 'Chip, chip, chip.' He made a great play, and from there on out, I just used my speed,\" said Wood, still breathing heavily from the game-winning play. \"I definitely kicked it into high gear there.\"\n\nCale Makar had a goal and two assists for Colorado, while Valerie Nichushkin had a goal and an assist. Nathan MacKinnon had the tying goal only 39 seconds into the third period when left open just to the left of the net, and Mikko Rantanen had a shot off the post midway through the third period.\n\n\"It would have been easy to kind of fold after that first period. But we felt like we were playing better than what the score showed,\" MacKinnon said. \"We wanted to see it through and defintely happy to get the comeback.\"\n\nAlexander Georgiev had 19 saves while winning his fifth consecutive start in goal for the Avalanche. But the Stars, after nine shots on net in the first period, had only seven combined the rest of regulation, and six in overtime when he denied Tyler Seguin twice in less than a minute and knocked down a couple of long high shots by Thomas Harley.\n\n\"He's been playing great for us. We're all so pumped for him,\" Wood said of the goalie. \"He let in three there in the first quickly, but he was solid from there on out.\"\n\nStars goalie Jake Oettinger stopped 22 shots, ending his six-game streak of allowing two goals or less.\n\nDallas jumped to a 3-0 lead in the first period against the 2022 Stanley Cup champion, only two nights after wrapping up a seven-game series against Vegas, last year's champ, in which both teams finished with 16 goals and the margin was never more than two goals.\n\n\"It's a tough turnaround for us as a group. I thought we had a great start,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. \"The fatigue from Game 7 I thought hit us in the second half of that game.\"\n\nJamie Benn had a goal and an assist for the Stars, who lost their series opener at home like in the first round when they dropped the first two games. Ryan Sutter and Wyatt Johnston also scored goals.\n\nGame 2 is Thursday night.\n\nColorado scored 28 goals in five games against Winnipeg, and had gone a full week since wrapping that series up in five games. The Avs had three comeback wins against the Jets, but none of those were from more than one-goal deficits.\n\nIt wasn't the first time this season for the Avalanche to come back from a 3-0 deficit in Dallas. They were down that early in the second period back in November before scoring six unanswered goals in a 6-3 win.\n\n\"You can't take a breath with these guys,\" Benn said. \"They're a great team.\"\n\nColorado scored two power-play goals in the second period, with Nichushkin getting his eighth goal of the playoffs, and extended his goal-scoring streak this postseason to six games, only seconds into having a man advantage. He then assisted about 3 1/2 minutes later on Makar's goal that got them within 3-2.\n\nNichushkin, the 10th overall draft pick by Dallas in 2013, knocked in the loose puck after Makar had a shot off Oettinger that Ryan Suter was unable to clear. Makar did get a wrister from about 50 feet into the net on his next shot.\n\nSuter, the 39-year-old defenseman whose 1,444 career regular-season games are the most for any player without winning a Stanley Cup, put the Stars up 1-0 with a 60-footer from near the left boards only 7 1/2 minutes into the game. Georgiev never saw the puck becuse of all the traffic in front of the net after Suter got a pass from Matt Duchene, who had just gotten up from taking a hit.\n\nThe Stars made it 2-0 directly off a faceoff win by Benn, with the puck going off Joe Pavelski to the 20-year-old Johnston, who scored from the top of the left circle for his fifth goal this postseason -- and ninth of his career.\n\nDallas was on a 5-on-3 power play when Benn scored with three minutes left in the first period by deflected a flying puck into the net.\n\nAnd the Stars captain almost had another goal in the closing seconds on another power play. He made a nifty move and made a swiping shot while falling down to get the puck behind Georgiev before defenseman Josh Manson knocked it away from the goal line.\n\n___\n\nAP NHL playoffs:

Took us a bit but once we found our legs, I thought we had a great second, great third,\" said MacKinnon, who tied the game at 3-3 in the opening minute of the third period.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's playoff hockey, and there is just no quit,\" said defenseman Cale Makar, who had a goal and two assists. \"If you are going to look at this game I feel like, as a group, we just stuck with it and grinded it out and found a way to win it.\"\n\nColorado had its first three-goal comeback in a playoff game since 1997. Miles Wood scored with a hard charge and a backhander 11:03 into overtime for a 4-3 win Tuesday night.\n\n\"It took us a little while to get to our game tonight,\" Avs coach Jared Bednar said. \"They capitalized on their chances in the first period.\"\n\nDallas had nine shots on goal in the first period, and came just inches short of a fourth goal. But the Stars had just seven more shots the rest of regulation before being denied six times by Alexander Georgiev in overtime before former Dallas player Andrew Cogliano got a puck out of a scrum in the corner and chipped ahead to Wood, who was screaming for the puck.\n\nThe Avalanche, the 2022 Stanley Cup champion, finished their first series in five games over Winnipeg.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stars had to go the distance before eliminating the Vegas Golden Knights, last year's champions. They won 2-1 in Game 7 at home on Sunday night.\n\n\"I knew that there would be some fatigue and a little bit of an emotional letdown coming off Game 7. I was actually surprised at how sharp we were to start, but it did hit us in the middle part of that game,\" Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. \"And you also knew that they might be a little rusty at the start. But as they got comfortable, they would get better because they've been off for a week. So I think that's probably what you saw.\"\n\nColorado had three comeback wins against the Jets in the first round, but none of those were from more than one-goal deficits.\n\nBut this wasn't the first time this season for the Avalanche to come back from a 3-0 deficit in Dallas. They were down that early in the second period back in November before scoring six unanswered goals in a 6-3 win.\n\nThe Avs were 3-1 in the regular season against Dallas. They came back in all of them, from two goals down in a 5-4 overtime win and giving up the first goal to a 5-1 win in the other.\n\nMacKinnon said it was easy to draw comparisons from those comebacks.\n\n\"I think against Dallas and then all playoffs we've been pretty good from down a few. Tonight was no different,\" he said. \"It didn't feel like they were dominating us. They had a seeing-eye shot. One went off our defensman's stick. ... But definitely, you felt like we were in it even though it was 3-0.\"\n\nAnd now they are up 1-0 in the series.\n\nAP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_hawkins@eagletribune.com", "name": "Stephen Hawkins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cogliano", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Cogliano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Bednar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Bednar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/eagletribune.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/22/322e43dd-48dd-57d4-91b1-daf5051a32d7/663b0a7c13b86.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

(Cogliano) gets his eyes up and Wood was fresh and went slashing through their D,\" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"When Woody get's going like that, he's hard to stop. He's fast and he's powerful, and he just took it to the house.\"\n\nStaying ahead of defenseman Miro Heiskanen, Wood got the puck around Jake Oettinger to wrap up only the Avalanche's third three-goal comeback to win a playoff game in their history -- and first since 1997.\n\n\"There's a scrum in the corner there. ... I was just screaming 'Chip, chip, chip.' He made a great play, and from there on out, I just used my speed,\" said Wood, still breathing heavily from the game-winning play. \"I definitely kicked it into high gear there.\"\n\nCale Makar had a goal and two assists for Colorado, while Valerie Nichushkin had a goal and an assist. Nathan MacKinnon had the tying goal only 39 seconds into the third period when left open just to the left of the net, and Mikko Rantanen, who had two assists, had a shot off the post midway through the third period.\n\n\"It would have been easy to kind of fold after that first period,\" MacKinnon said. \"But we felt like we were playing better than what the score showed. We wanted to see it through\"\n\nAlexander Georgiev had 19 saves while winning his fifth consecutive start in goal for the Avs. But Dallas, after nine shots on net in the first period, had only seven combined the rest of regulation, and six in overtime when he denied Tyler Seguin twice in less than a minute and knocked down a couple of long high shots by Thomas Harley.\n\n\"He's been playing great for us. We're all so pumped for him,\" Wood said of the goalie. \"He let in three there in the first quickly, but he was solid from there on out.\"\n\nStars goalie Oettinger stopped 22 shots, ending his six-game streak of allowing two goals or less.\n\nDallas led 3-0 in the first period against the 2022 Stanley Cup champion, only two nights after wrapping up a seven-game series against Vegas, last year's champ, in which both teams finished with 16 goals and the margin was never more than two goals.\n\n\"It's a tough turnaround for us as a group. I thought we had a great start,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. \"The fatigue from Game 7 I thought hit us in the second half of that game.\"\n\nJamie Benn had a goal and an assist for the Stars, who lost their series opener at home like in the first round when they dropped the first two games. Ryan Sutter and Wyatt Johnston also scored goals.\n\nGame 2 is Thursday night.\n\nColorado scored 28 goals in five games against Winnipeg, and had gone a full week since wrapping that series up in five games. The Avs had three comeback wins against the Jets, but none of those were from more than one-goal deficits.\n\nIt wasn't the first time this season for the Avalanche to come back from a 3-0 deficit in Dallas. They were down that early in the second period back in November before scoring six unanswered goals in a 6-3 win.\n\n\"You can't take a breath with these guys,\" Benn said. \"They're a great team.\"\n\nColorado scored two power-play goals in the second period, with Nichushkin getting his eighth goal of the playoffs, and extending his goal-scoring streak this postseason to six games before assisting on Makar's goal that got them within 3-2.\n\nNichushkin, the 10th overall draft pick by Dallas in 2013, knocked in the loose puck after Makar had a shot off Oettinger that Ryan Suter was unable to clear. Makar did get a wrister from about 50 feet into the net on his next shot.\n\nSuter, the 39-year-old defenseman whose 1,444 career regular-season games are the most for any player without winning a Stanley Cup, put the Stars up 1-0 with a 60-footer from near the left boards only 7 1/2 minutes into the game. Georgiev never saw the puck because of all the traffic in front of the net after Suter got a pass from Matt Duchene, who had just gotten up from taking a hit.\n\nThe Stars made it 2-0 directly off a faceoff win by Benn, with the 20-year-old Johnston scoring from the top of the left circle for his fifth goal this postseason.\n\nDallas was on a 5-on-3 power play when Benn scored with three minutes left in the first period by deflected a flying puck into the net.\n\nAnd the Stars captain almost had another goal in the closing seconds on another power play. He made a nifty move and made a swiping shot while falling down to get the puck behind Georgiev before defenseman Josh Manson knocked it away from the goal line.", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cogliano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Cogliano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miro_Heiskanen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miro Heiskanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Bednar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jared Bednar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miles Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Benn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Benn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Suter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Suter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Seguin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Seguin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Johnston", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyatt Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Manson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Manson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Duchene", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Duchene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.nbcdfw.com/2024/05/AP24129149891015.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Took us a bit but once we found our legs, I thought we had a great second, great third,\" said MacKinnon, who tied the game at 3-3 in the opening minute of the third period.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it\u00b4s playoff hockey, and there is just no quit,\" said defenseman Cale Makar, who had a goal and two assists. \"If you are going to look at this game I feel like, as a group, we just stuck with it and grinded it out and found a way to win it.\"\n\nColorado had its first three-goal comeback in a playoff game since 1997. Miles Wood scored with a hard charge and a backhander 11:03 into overtime for a 4-3 win Tuesday night.\n\n\"It took us a little while to get to our game tonight,\" Avs coach Jared Bednar said. \"They capitalized on their chances in the first period.\"\n\nColorado Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon (29) celebrates in front of right wing Valeri Nichushkin (13) and Dallas Stars defenseman Miro Heiskanen (4) after scoring a goal in the third period in Game 2 of an NHL hockey Stanley Cup second-round playoff series in Dallas, Tuesday, May 7, 2024. (AP Photo/LM Otero)\n\nDallas had nine shots on goal in the first period, and came just inches short of a fourth goal. But the Stars had just seven more shots the rest of regulation before being denied six times by Alexander Georgiev in overtime before former Dallas player Andrew Cogliano got a puck out of a scrum in the corner and chipped ahead to Wood, who was screaming for the puck.\n\nThe Avalanche, the 2022 Stanley Cup champion, finished their first series in five games over Winnipeg.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stars had to go the distance before eliminating the Vegas Golden Knights, last year's champions. They won 2-1 in Game 7 at home on Sunday night.\n\n\"I knew that there would be some fatigue and a little bit of an emotional letdown coming off Game 7. I was actually surprised at how sharp we were to start, but it did hit us in the middle part of that game,\" Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. \"And you also knew that they might be a little rusty at the start. But as they got comfortable, they would get better because they\u00b4ve been off for a week. So I think that\u00b4s probably what you saw.\"\n\nColorado had three comeback wins against the Jets in the first round, but none of those were from more than one-goal deficits.\n\nBut this wasn\u00b4t the first time this season for the Avalanche to come back from a 3-0 deficit in Dallas. They were down that early in the second period back in November before scoring six unanswered goals in a 6-3 win.\n\nThe Avs were 3-1 in the regular season against Dallas. They came back in all of them, from two goals down in a 5-4 overtime win and giving up the first goal to a 5-1 win in the other.\n\nMacKinnon said it was easy to draw comparisons from those comebacks.\n\n\"I think against Dallas and then all playoffs we\u00b4ve been pretty good from down a few. Tonight was no different,\" he said. \"It didn\u00b4t feel like they were dominating us. They had a seeing-eye shot. One went off our defensman\u00b4s stick. ... But definitely, you felt like we were in it even though it was 3-0.\"\n\nAnd now they are up 1-0 in the series.\n\nAP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL\n\nColorado Avalanche's Andrew Cogliano (11), Nathan MacKinnon (29), Ross Colton (20), Mikko Rantanen (96), Casey Mittelstadt and Miles Wood, center rear, celebrate after Wood scored in overtime in Game 2 of an NHL hockey Stanley Cup second-round playoff series against the Dallas Stars in Dallas, Tuesday, May 7, 2024.

I couldn't tell who popped the puck to (Cogliano), and I was just screaming 'Chip, chip, chip.' He made a great play, and from there on out, I just used my speed,\" said Wood, still breathing heavily from the game-winning play. \"I definitely kicked it into high gear there.\"\n\nCale Makar had a goal and two assists for Colorado, while Valerie Nichushkin had a goal and an assist. Nathan MacKinnon had the tying goal only 39 seconds into the third period when left open just to the left of the net, and Mikko Rantanen had a shot off the post midway through the third period.\n\nAlexander Georgiev had 19 saves while winning his fifth consecutive start in goal for the Avalanche. But the Stars, after nine shots on net in the first period, had only seven combined the rest of regulation, and six in overtime when he denied Tyler Seguin twice in less than a minute and knocked down a couple of long high shots by Thomas Harley.\n\n\"He's been playing great for us. We're all so pumped for him,\" Wood said of the goalie. \"He let in three there in the first quickly, but he was solid from there on out.\"\n\nStars goalie Jake Oettinger stopped 22 shots, ending his six-game streak of allowing two goals or less.\n\nDallas jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the first period against the 2022 Stanley Cup champion, only two nights after wrapping up a seven-game series against Vegas, last year's champ, in which both teams finished with 16 goals and the margin was never more than two goals.\n\nJamie Benn had a goal and an assist for the Stars, who lost their series opener at home like in the first round when they dropped the first two games. Ryan Sutter and Wyatt Johnston also scored goals.\n\nGame 2 is Thursday night.\n\nColorado scored 28 goals in five games against Winnipeg, and had gone a full week since wrapping that series up in five games. The Avs had three comeback wins against the Jets, but none of those were from more than one-goal deficits.\n\nIt wasn't the first time this season for the Avalanche to come back from a 3-0 deficit in Dallas. They were down that early in the second period back in November before scoring six unanswered goals in a 6-3 win.\n\nColorado scored two power-play goals in the second period, with Nichushkin getting his eighth goal of the playoffs, and extended his goal-scoring streak this postseason to six games, only seconds into having a man advantage. He then assisted about 3 1/2 minutes later on Makar's goal that got them within 3-2.\n\nNichushkin, the 10th overall draft pick by Dallas in 2013, knocked in the loose puck after Makar had a shot off Oettinger that Suter was unable to clear. Makar did get a wrister from about 50 feet into the net on his next shot.\n\nSuter, the 39-year-old defenseman whose 1,444 career regular-season games are the most for any player without winning a Stanley Cup, put the Stars up 1-0 with a 60-footer from near the left boards only 7 1/2 minutes into the game. Georgiev never saw the puck becuse of all the traffic in front of the net after Suter got a pass from Matt Duchene, who had just gotten up from taking a hit.\n\nThe Stars made it 2-0 directly off a faceoff win by Benn, with the puck going off Joe Pavelski to the 20-year-old Johnston, who scored from the top of the left circle for his fifth goal this postseason -- and ninth his career.\n\nDallas was on a 5-on-3 power play when Benn scored with three minutes left in the first period by deflected a flying puck into the net.\n\nAnd the Stars captain almost had another goal in the closing seconds on another power play. He made a nifty move and made a swiping shot while falling down to get the puck behind Georgiev before defenseman Josh Manson knocked it away from the goal line.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The Stars are trying to win the Stanley Cup for the first time since 1999 and the Avalanche are looking to claim it again after winning in 2022.\n\nThe Avalanche and Stars begin the Western Conference Second Round with Game 1 at American Airlines Center on Tuesday (9:30 p.m. ET; ESPN, SN360, SN, TVAS). The Stars, who eliminated the Vegas Golden Knights with a 2-1 win in Game 7 of the first round Monday, have many believing this is their year. But the Avalanche, who knocked off the Winnipeg Jets in five games in their first-round series, make for a formidable opponent and know what it takes this time of year.\n\nThe Avalanche went 3-1-0 against the Stars in the regular season.\n\nSo who wins the second-round series between two of the West's best? That's the question before NHL.com staff writer Tracey Myers and columnist Nicholas J. Cotsonika.\n\nMyers: Yes, I know, I took the Stars to go all the way in the various picks I've made, but I'm also up for a good argument and I could definitely see the Avalanche winning this series. Let's look at what they did to the Jets in the first round, shall we? They seemed to score at will, averaging 5.60 goals per game against the stingiest team in the regular season (2.41 goals-against per game, tied for first with Florida Panthers). Getting that many goals past Connor Hellebuyck, a finalist for the Vezina Trophy given to the top goalie in the NHL, was impressive. The Avalanche are deep, and their offense is firing on all cylinders. Does the nearly week-long respite they've had cause a problem? I don't think so. They were healthy coming out of the first round, minus the usual bumps and bruises. This may also give them some time to get Jonathan Drouin closer to coming back after the forward missed the first round with a lower-body injury. I'm so looking forward to this series. It's going to be a doozie, and the Avalanche could certainly advance.\n\nCotsonika: Right there with you, Tracey. I could definitely see Colorado winning this series, but I picked Dallas to win the Cup, and I'm sticking with the Stars in this series. They can play any way you want. The Avalanche were the highest-scoring team in the regular season (3.68 goals per game). Well, the Stars ranked third (3.59). The last time these teams played, the Stars won 7-4 in Denver on April 7, so they have shown they can defeat the Avalanche in a high-scoring game. Colorado has a lethal power play (37.5 percent, third in the postseason). Well, Dallas doesn't take many penalties. The Stars also can slow the rush game, lock it down defensively and win a tight series, like they showed against the Golden Knights in the first round, and they have the advantage in goal with Jake Oettinger. Dallas just defeated the 2023 Stanley Cup champions. The 2022 Stanley Cup champions are next.\n\nMyers: For sure, the Stars have a lot of ways to play, which is good because the Avalanche bring a different style than the Golden Knights. There's a lot of speed, a lot of skill. OK, Vegas obviously has skill too, but we're talking Nathan MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen and Cale Makar here. Big, saucy skill (yes, I said saucy). And though the Stars may not take many penalties, the Avalanche can defeat teams 5-on-5 as well as anyone. They scored 17 goals at 5-on-5 in the first round, most of any team in the postseason. Again, this was a tough take for me to make given where I've gone with my picks previously, but the Avalanche made me a believer after the first round. I thought that series would be tight, going six or seven games. I was wrong on both counts. Man, how great is this series going to be?\n\nCotsonika: Right there with you again, Tracey. The Avalanche are scary good, and this should be a great series. The Stars are excellent at 5-on-5. This is a deep lineup with layers of veterans and up-and-coming players. They have top-end guys like Wyatt Johnston, Jason Robertson and Miro Heiskanen. Chris Tanev has been a huge addition to the back end. They have Jamie Benn, Matt Duchene, Roope Hintz, Joe Pavelski, Tyler Seguin and Ryan Suter. Thomas Harley has made strides. Logan Stankoven has been a revelation. Their first-round heroes included bottom-six forwards Evgenii Dadonov, Ty Dellandrea and Radek Faksa. The Avalanche just won four out of five games against an outstanding team. Well, after falling in a 2-0 hole, so did the Stars. That should set them up to squeak past the Avalanche in another competitive, entertaining series.", "source": {"uri": "nhl.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NHL.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The performance put the league on notice, as they piled up 28 goals in the five games - against likely Vezina Trophy winner Connor Hellebuyck. The domination was interesting, considering the Jets ripped Colorado in all three of their games during the regular season.\n\nNow the Avs turn their attention to the Dallas Stars in the second round - a team Colorado did pretty well against during the regular season, winning three of four games. The Avalanche notably won both games in Dallas, and came from behind in all three victories. Colorado had 19 different players score a point against the Stars this season - and they'll need help from everybody to advance to the Western Conference Final. Here's a look at three players that need to come through for the Avs to dump the Stars:\n\nIt might not be anything personal for Valeri Nichushkin to face the team that drafted him, especially because he's not anywhere close to the player that wore a Stars jersey for four seasons. He managed just 23 goals in 223 games across those four campaigns in Dallas, and the Stars unsurprisingly cut him loose before the 2019-20 season. Enter the Avalanche. Colorado signed him off the scrap heap a couple months before the season started, and it's meant a renaissance for his career.\n\nNichushkin has put up at least 25 goals in two of the last three seasons, and currently leads the NHL with seven goals in these playoffs alone. He racked up 28 goals this season despite playing in just 54 games. It's hard to believe he's the same guy that scored zero goals in 57 games back in 2018-19. That feels like a million years ago, as he's solidified himself as an incredible complement on the top line with Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen. Those two don't miss much, but Nichushkin has been there to clean up after them when they do.\n\nRelated: Awards from the Avalanche vs. Jets First-Round Series\n\nNichushkin might be the most important forward for Colorado in its series against the Stars, as Dallas netminder Jake Oettinger looks dialed in once again. The Avalanche are hoping their impressive effort against Hellebuyck carries over, but Oettinger will likely provide a tougher test. Nichushkin will be a vital cog not only scoring goals, but also for creating traffic in front of the net with his 6-foot-4, 210-pound frame. If he keeps pouring on the pressure and scoring goals at his current clip, the Avalanche could be a lock for the Western Conference Final.\n\nThere are plenty of solid defensemen in this series, but no one might be as important to the overall picture for Colorado as Devon Toews. Sure, Cale Makar is going to pile up a bunch of points and he's a pretty darn good defender in his own right, but Toews delivers lots of important minutes, too, and is one of the team's most important penalty-killers. Toews is arguably the best penalty killer on the club, and his play in that area will be paramount to Colorado's success against Dallas - one of the best power-play teams in the league all season.\n\nDuring the regular season, the Stars had the sixth-best power play at 24.2 percent. Avalanche fans know how potent the Colorado power play was in 2023-24, and they were just 0.3 percent better than Dallas. The Stars have scored four power-play goals so far this postseason, and are at 28.6 percent in these playoffs. Toews logged the 11-most minutes on the penalty kill in the NHL this season, and the Avs are going to lean on him once again.\n\nRelated: 3 Keys to the Stars Beating the Avalanche in Round 2\n\nColorado is notorious for coming back, leading the NHL in come-from-behind victories this season. They even had three in their four games against Dallas. That's a dangerous recipe to work with in the postseason, especially with Oettinger looking locked in. That means the Avalanche can't allow the power play to set the Stars up with a lead. Toews scored a short-handed goal against Winnipeg in the first round, and that's the type of presence the Avs will need in the second round. If he's in control of the penalty kill, and leads that unit to shutting down a potent Dallas power play, that's a big step toward another series victory.\n\nHe's been a fan favorite since he got to Denver in a trade deadline deal a couple years ago, and Artturi Lehkonen is trying his hardest to replicate his first postseason with the team in these playoffs. In the first round, Lehkonen's five goals were second on the team only to Nichushkin's league-leading seven tallies. Lehkonen's eight points are just one fewer than MacKinnon, Makar, and Rantanen - who all have nine points. He's clicking right now, and it's that kind of depth scoring that Colorado is going to need for another deep run.\n\nLehkonen played in just two of the regular-season games against the Stars this season, but still managed to put up two goals and an assist. In 14 career games against Dallas, he has six goals and 11 points. That's the most against any team he's played fewer than 22 games against. He's found a home in Colorado, and it's because his consistency continues from the regular season into the postseason. He wrapped up the regular season with at least a point in eight of the last nine games, and has scored a goal in each of Colorado's playoff games.\n\nRelated: Canadiens Trading Lehkonen to the Avalanche Saved His Career\n\nThe Avalanche are clearly in a championship window, and Lehkonen played a key role in their 2022 title. His eight goals were tied with Makar for fourth on the team in those playoffs, and he finished with 14 points in those 20 games. MacKinnon, Makar, and Rantanen are likely always going to make some sort of impact, but it's going to take guys like Lehkonen to push them across the finish line. They need Lehkonen to continue his current play if they're going to get back to the Western Conference Final, because that will mean the depth scoring has continued against the Stars. The Avalanche have the pieces to make a run for their fourth championship, but these three players will be critical to their second-round success.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kerry_collins@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Kerry Collins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Hellebuyck", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Connor Hellebuyck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_Toews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devon Toews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artturi_Lehkonen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artturi Lehkonen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Valeri-Nichushkin-Avalanche-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

That's a high-octane team over there. It was a very different style of game. We can do a better job throughout the 60 minutes, imposing our game on them with the puck.\"\n\nThe Stars lost the first two games in the opening round before recovering and beating the defending Stanley Cup-champion Vegas Golden Knights in Game 7. Dallas knows duplicating that feat will be a tall order.\n\nThe Stars must improve their ability to hold a lead, but that's not the only area of concern. Dallas must find a way to curtail Colorado's potent power play, which sparked the comeback with a pair of second-period man-advantage goals.\n\nThe Stars also need more from their lineup. While Wyatt Johnston, Jason Robertson and Jamie Benn have been providing consistent offense, other top players such as Roope Hintz, Joe Pavelski, Tyler Seguin and Duchene have been quiet.\n\n\"At the end of the night, their big guys delivered and were all over the scoresheet,\" Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. \"Some of our scoring has to step up. We've been waiting for a series plus a game now for some of that.\"\n\nThe Avalanche have won five consecutive playoff games since losing their first-round opener to the Winnipeg Jets. Colorado has shown plenty of offensive punch in that stretch.\n\nAs much as the Avalanche can take pride in drumming up an impressive comeback victory to kick off this series, they know it is not a long-term recipe for success against the Stars, who finished atop the Western Conference standings in the regular season.\n\n\"We had lapses, momentary lapses in our game, that put us on our heels,\" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. \"You can't rest on the ice in the NHL in the Stanley Cup playoffs, not against a team like Dallas, right? We were doing some resting out there. We were watching other guys work, and the work wasn't fluid enough as a group of five as what it needed to be.\"\n\nKnowing Colorado has the firepower to come back -- led by Nathan MacKinnon, Valeri Nichushkin, Artturi Lehkonen, Mikko Rantanen and defenseman Cale Makar -- is comforting. The Avalanche have 32 goals in six playoff games this year and are the only team averaging more than five goals per game in the postseason.\n\nColorado's cavalcade of talent converted both power-play opportunities in Game 1, and has now clicked for eight goals on 18 chances with the man advantage in the playoffs this year.\n\n\"It's been huge,\" MacKinnon said, according to the Denver Post. \"It's our job to produce on the power play. It's so tight out there. Guys are playing so hard defensively. The power play is huge. I'm sure they'll make some adjustments. But we've got to keep finding ways to produce.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@sacbee.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Duchene", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matt Duchene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roope_Hintz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roope Hintz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pavelski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Pavelski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Benn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Benn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Seguin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Seguin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Bednar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Bednar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denver_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Denver Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artturi_Lehkonen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artturi Lehkonen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/jck3pw/picture288426507/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/8b9346b8-d5e8-4b15-8852-afc80388c016", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

It's not like we need a lot of work on pre-scout. We're very familiar with each other. We'll enjoy this one in the short term and then start thinking about that.\"\n\nColorado won three of four meetings with Dallas this season, but the Stars claimed the top seed in the West with 113 points, six more than the Avalanche.\n\nDallas has to regroup and be ready for a quick turnaround after a difficult opening round. The Stars lost the first two games of the series at home against Vegas but bounced back to win four of the next five thanks to a balanced attack and strong defensive play. Dallas surrendered only nine goals in the last five games of the series.\n\n\"There's probably a lot of doubters out there after Game 2 that probably thought we couldn't come back. A lot of believers in this room, in this organization,\" Stars captain Jamie Benn said. \"We played two pretty good games in the first two and we felt we were the better team. Fortunately, we came out on top.\"\n\nThe Avalanche have been anticipating their next opponent since knocking out the Winnipeg Jets in five games, a series that ended last Tuesday.\n\nColorado lost Game 1 against the Jets before winning four straight games. The Avalanche became only the fourth team in NHL history to score at least five goals in each of its first five games of the playoffs. Colorado racked up 28 goals against Winnipeg, which was tied with the Florida Panthers for the fewest goals allowed in the regular season.\n\n\"If those were the five best (games) in the season, our next five are going to have to be even better,\" Avalanche defenseman Cale Makar said. \"That's the way the playoffs go. You have to keep getting better and better each round.\"\n\nAs much as Colorado's attack was led by Makar (two goals, seven assists), along with top-line forwards Nathan MacKinnon (two, seven) and Mikko Rantanen (two, seven), the Avalanche's offensive depth was on full display against Winnipeg.\n\nValeri Nichushkin scored seven goals, Artturi Lehkonen tallied five times and Casey Mittelstadt, who was acquired from the Buffalo Sabres at the trade deadline, netted one goal and recorded five assists.\n\nThe late-season acquisitions of forwards Mittelstadt, Brandon Duhaime, Yakov Trenin and Zach Parise, as well as defenseman Sean Walker, have made the Avalanche a more complete squad compared with the one that was eliminated in the first round last spring.\n\n\"We filled some needs that we had and made our team stronger depth-wise,\" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"The defensive aspect of the games, some size and strength things. Once that happened at the deadline, our team was really focused on the opportunity ahead of us, and they did a nice job getting ready to play for round one.\"\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "sunherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sun Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@sunherald.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Benn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Benn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Walker_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Walker (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Bednar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Bednar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Parise", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Parise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Mittelstadt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casey Mittelstadt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Sabres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artturi_Lehkonen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artturi Lehkonen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/j5wpju/picture288368820/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/7e556686-a1ed-4b25-acc6-1b23ebe1db4e", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

They've got that quick-strike ability that you've gotta be mentally sharp for 60 minutes in order to beat them.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, it wasn't the first time Dallas had been taught that lesson. The Stars have blown an early lead to Colorado in all five of their meetings this season.\n\nIn their first matchup back in November, the Stars led 3-0 early in the second period before the Avalanche scored six consecutive goals to win 6-3.\n\nIn their second meeting in January, Dallas blew a two-goal lead with 10 minutes remaining, and Nathan MacKinnon scored the game-winner for Colorado in overtime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their third matchup in February, Logan Stankoven scored a minute into the game, but that lead held for just 1:08 before Colorado tied it up and ultimately went on to win 5-1.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn their final meeting against Colorado in April -- their only win against the Avalanche all year -- the Stars saw a 5-2 lead narrow to 5-4 with under 10 minutes remaining. Wyatt Johnston and Tyler Seguin had to find two late goals to put the game out of reach.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was the same story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We shouldn't have gotten to overtime,\" Stars forward Matt Duchene said. \"We're up 3-0. I don't think we stayed on our toes enough in the second. We kind of took our foot off the gas a little bit. They started to come at us with a couple of penalties, and their power play was obviously lethal. ... We had that game under control, and we let it slip away.\"\n\nDallas' three-goal first-period came as a surprise, even to those in its locker room. The Stars were less than 48 hours removed from a grueling Game 7 against Vegas. Colorado was well-rested after a week off.\n\nThe Stars managed to carry that Game 7 momentum into the first period before it stalled. Meanwhile, Colorado started rusty but eventually settled into its game where it took over.\n\n\"That's a high-octane team over there. It was a very different style of game,\" Duchene said. \"I think we can probably do a better job throughout the 60 minutes in forcing our game and imposing our game on them with the puck. We got away from it a bit in the second and kind of tide turned there.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the second period and early in the third is where Colorado's playmakers turned the game. Dallas took two penalties early in the second, and the Avalanche's dominant power play connected on both.\n\nTop-line forward Valeri Nichushkin struck first while Norris Trophy finalist Cale Makar added a power-play goal next. Then, just 39 seconds into the third period, MacKinnon scored off a rebound to tie the game.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stars didn't get a goal from either their typical top three forwards (Jason Robertson, Roope Hintz and Joe Pavelski) or their top defensive pairing (Miro Heiskanen and Thomas Harley). All three goals came from their third forward line and third defensive pairing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeBoer acknowledged postgame that needs to change.\n\n\"At the end of the night, when you look at the score sheet, their big guys all kind of delivered and are all over the score sheet, and I thought a couple of our guys were, but some of our scoring has to step up,\" he said. \"We've been waiting for a series plus a game now for some of that.\"\n\nDallas had the more complete overtime, but it wasn't enough to put the puck in the net. One bounce ended up on Miles Wood's stick, and it just took one move around Jake Oettinger to seal the win.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Dallas never should've been in that position to begin with.\n\nEach series comes with a learning curve, but the Stars have had plenty of exposure to the Avalanche to know that no lead is safe against them.\n\nThey'll need another hot start on Thursday, but this time they'll have to find a way to keep that distance. If they can't, their season will be on the line again heading on another road trip where their luck could soon run out.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreFive thoughts from Stars-Avalanche Game 1: Dallas can't contain Colorado stars in OT lossFull coverage: Avs recover from 3-0 deficit to beat Stars 4-3 in overtimeDallas, Denver mayors place 'Texas-style' bet on Stars-Avalanche playoff seriesAdvertisement\n\nFind more Stars coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Duchene", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Duchene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Stankoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logan Stankoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Johnston", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyatt Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Seguin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Seguin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Harley_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Harley (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roope_Hintz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roope Hintz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miro_Heiskanen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miro Heiskanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pavelski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Pavelski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Norris_Memorial_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Norris Memorial Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miles Wood"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/CV3JL53NBVCMXNW3R3PB6S5AUU.jpg?auth=af0e1bb0d12c36379f642ab5d150fac95bca726acfddfab4d4d781136543d322&height=467&width=830&smart=true&quality=40", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Miles Wood scored with a hard charge and a backhander 11:03 into overtime for a 4-3 win Tuesday night.\n\n\"It took us a little while to get to our game tonight,\" Avs coach Jared Bednar said. \"They capitalized on their chances in the first period.\"\n\nDallas had nine shots on goal in the first period, and came just inches short of a fourth goal. But the Stars had just seven more shots the rest of regulation before being denied six times by Alexander Georgiev in overtime before former Dallas player Andrew Cogliano got a puck out of a scrum in the corner and chipped ahead to Wood, who was screaming for the puck.\n\nThe Avalanche, the 2022 Stanley Cup champion, finished their first series in five games over Winnipeg.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stars had to go the distance before eliminating the Vegas Golden Knights, last year's champions. They won 2-1 in Game 7 at home on Sunday night.\n\n\"I knew that there would be some fatigue and a little bit of an emotional letdown coming off Game 7. I was actually surprised at how sharp we were to start, but it did hit us in the middle part of that game,\" Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. \"And you also knew that they might be a little rusty at the start. But as they got comfortable, they would get better because they've been off for a week. So I think that's probably what you saw.\"\n\nColorado had three comeback wins against the Jets in the first round, but none of those were from more than one-goal deficits.\n\nBut this wasn't the first time this season for the Avalanche to come back from a 3-0 deficit in Dallas. They were down that early in the second period back in November before scoring six unanswered goals in a 6-3 win.\n\nThe Avs were 3-1 in the regular season against Dallas. They came back in all of them, from two goals down in a 5-4 overtime win and giving up the first goal to a 5-1 win in the other.\n\nMacKinnon said it was easy to draw comparisons from those comebacks.\n\n\"I think against Dallas and then all playoffs we've been pretty good from down a few. Tonight was no different,\" he said. \"It didn't feel like they were dominating us. They had a seeing-eye shot. One went off our defensman's stick. ...

They now face the Avalanche, who by time the puck drops for Game 1 on Tuesday night will have gone a full week since wrapping up their opening round with 28 goals in five games against one of the league's top defensive teams.\n\n\"We're going to have to work ourselves into the series to see how we're going to have to win,\" DeBoer said Monday. \"My initial reaction, just watching what they did to Winnipeg, is I don't think we want to get in a track meet. ... At the same time, we're not going to sit and try to defend in the entire series. I think we've got other layers to our game.\"\n\nDallas can score, too, with a franchise-record eight 20-goal scorers in the regular season and ranking third in the NHL at 3.59 goals per game. The Avs had a league-high 3.68.\n\nWhile the Stars hope to have an advantage going right from one series to another one, the Avalanche are drawing on experience from long layoffs during their 2022 Stanley Cup title run. They had a break of more than a week between the first and second rounds, and another before the final when they knocked off Tampa Bay in six games.\n\n\"We approached this week the same as we did then,\" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"The way you handle every situation it\u00b4s not just like, you know, willy-nilly, you\u00b4re trying to think of the best way to do it. You\u00b4re gathering information from your team on rest, work, how they\u00b4re feeling, what we can go over, just trying to fine-tune everything so we\u00b4re ready to go when the puck drops.\"\n\nColorado Avalanche's Mikko Rantanen (96) celebrates his goal with Valeri Nichushkin (13) and Nathan MacKinnon (29) during the third period in Game 5 of an NHL hockey Stanley Cup first-round playoff series against the Winnipeg Jets in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Tuesday, April 30, 2024. (Fred Greenslade/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nIn veteran center Nathan MacKinnon\u00b4s view, the Avs should be ready for one thing: \"Their best, hardest game,\" he said. \"We\u00b4re prepared to work our butts off and compete. We expect a very, very, very hard series. But we\u00b4re confident in ourselves. We feel like we have a deep team and we get the job done.\"\n\nValeri Nichushkin had seven goals, the most by the 12 different Colorado players that found the net in the opening round. Nichushkin and Artturi Lehkonen are the first teammates in NHL history with simultaneous five-game goal streaks to open a postseason.\n\nOnly three other teams have opened the playoffs with at least five goals in each of their first five games. The Avs are the first since the 1994 New York Rangers, who then won their last Stanley Cup title.\n\nWinnipeg had allowed an NHL-low 2.41 goals a game in the regular season, while standout goalie Connor Hellebuyck had a 2.39 goals-against average in his 60 games.\n\nStars goalie Jake Oettinger had a 1.95 goals-against average and .925 save percentage against the Knights, and stopped 73 of 74 shots in the third period or overtime.\n\nOettinger allowed more than two goals only once over the last 11 regular-season games. The lone exception was a 7-4 win at Colorado on April 7 - he allowed 14 goals in three regular-season appearances against the Avs.\n\n\"The third period-overtime numbers show what we already knew here, that he\u00b4s a rise-to-the-occasion guy,\" DeBoer said. \"He recognizes the big moments, the important times of a series, of a game. And he finds another level for us, regardless of what\u00b4s happened before.\"\n\nColorado was 3-1 this season against the Stars, with Alexander Georgiev in net for all of them, also allowing 14 goals with an extra game. He had a 3.03 GAA and .893 save percentage in the first round against Winnipeg.\n\nAvalanche forward Zach Parise and Dallas defenseman Ryan Suter are former teammates and good friends who still hope to hoist the Stanley Cup for the first time.\n\nParise and Suter, both 39 years old, were together for nine seasons with the Minnesota Wild from 2012-21.\n\nSuter is in his third season with Dallas, where he signed in free agency after leaving the Wild, and his 1,444 career regular-season games are the most ever for a player without a Cup title. Third on that list is his current Stars teammate, 39-year-old Joe Pavelski with 1,332 games, and Parise is fifth with 1,254.\n\nParise has brought a veteran presence to the Colorado lineup since joining the team as a free agent in January. He said this will be his final NHL season.\n\nPavelski's 73 career playoff goals are the most for a U.S.-born player, but he didn't have a single point while managing only six shots on net in the seven-game series against Vegas.\n\n\"I have zero concern that Joe's fingerprints are going to be on our playoffs before this is said and done, regardless of what the stat lines say,\" said DeBoer, who also coached Pavelski in San Jose. \"They already are in all the other things he does, both in the dressing room and all the little intangibles on the ice.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham in Denver contributed to this story.\n\nAP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://apnews.com/hub/nhl\n\nDallas Stars goaltender Jake Oettinger (29) and Miro Heiskanen (4) defend against a shot by Vegas Golden Knights' Chandler Stephenson (20) as Thomas Harley (55) looks on late in the third period in Game 5 of an NHL hockey Stanley Cup first-round playoff series in Dallas, Wednesday, May 1, 2024.

I couldn't tell who popped the puck to (Cogliano), and I was just screaming 'Chip, chip, chip.' He made a great play, and from there on out, I just used my speed,\" said Wood, still breathing heavily from the game-winning play. \"I definitely kicked it into high gear there.\"\n\nCale Makar had a goal and two assists for Colorado, while Valerie Nichushkin had a goal and an assist. Nathan MacKinnon had the tying goal only 39 seconds into the third period when left open just to the left of the net, and Mikko Rantanen had a shot off the post midway through the third period.\n\n\"It would have been easy to kind of fold after that first period. But we felt like we were playing better than what the score showed,\" MacKinnon said. \"We wanted to see it through and defintely happy to get the comeback.\"\n\nAlexander Georgiev had 19 saves while winning his fifth consecutive start in goal for the Avalanche. But the Stars, after nine shots on net in the first period, had only seven combined the rest of regulation, and six in overtime when he denied Tyler Seguin twice in less than a minute and knocked down a couple of long high shots by Thomas Harley.\n\n\"He's been playing great for us. We're all so pumped for him,\" Wood said of the goalie. \"He let in three there in the first quickly, but he was solid from there on out.\"\n\nStars goalie Jake Oettinger stopped 22 shots, ending his six-game streak of allowing two goals or less.\n\nDallas jumped to a 3-0 lead in the first period against the 2022 Stanley Cup champion, only two nights after wrapping up a seven-game series against Vegas, last year's champ, in which both teams finished with 16 goals and the margin was never more than two goals.\n\n\"It's a tough turnaround for us as a group. I thought we had a great start,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. \"The fatigue from Game 7 I thought hit us in the second half of that game.\"\n\nJamie Benn had a goal and an assist for the Stars, who lost their series opener at home like in the first round when they dropped the first two games. Ryan Sutter and Wyatt Johnston also scored goals.\n\nGame 2 is Thursday night.\n\nColorado scored 28 goals in five games against Winnipeg, and had gone a full week since wrapping that series up in five games. The Avs had three comeback wins against the Jets, but none of those were from more than one-goal deficits.\n\nIt wasn't the first time this season for the Avalanche to come back from a 3-0 deficit in Dallas. They were down that early in the second period back in November before scoring six unanswered goals in a 6-3 win.\n\n\"You can't take a breath with these guys,\" Benn said. \"They're a great team.\"\n\nColorado scored two power-play goals in the second period, with Nichushkin getting his eighth goal of the playoffs, and extended his goal-scoring streak this postseason to six games, only seconds into having a man advantage. He then assisted about 3 1/2 minutes later on Makar's goal that got them within 3-2.\n\nNichushkin, the 10th overall draft pick by Dallas in 2013, knocked in the loose puck after Makar had a shot off Oettinger that Ryan Suter was unable to clear. Makar did get a wrister from about 50 feet into the net on his next shot.\n\nSuter, the 39-year-old defenseman whose 1,444 career regular-season games are the most for any player without winning a Stanley Cup, put the Stars up 1-0 with a 60-footer from near the left boards only 7 1/2 minutes into the game. Georgiev never saw the puck becuse of all the traffic in front of the net after Suter got a pass from Matt Duchene, who had just gotten up from taking a hit.\n\nThe Stars made it 2-0 directly off a faceoff win by Benn, with the puck going off Joe Pavelski to the 20-year-old Johnston, who scored from the top of the left circle for his fifth goal this postseason -- and ninth of his career.\n\nDallas was on a 5-on-3 power play when Benn scored with three minutes left in the first period by deflected a flying puck into the net.\n\nAnd the Stars captain almost had another goal in the closing seconds on another power play. He made a nifty move and made a swiping shot while falling down to get the puck behind Georgiev before defenseman Josh Manson knocked it away from the goal line.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cogliano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Cogliano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miro_Heiskanen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miro Heiskanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Johnston", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyatt Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Harley_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Harley (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Benn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Benn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Suter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Suter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Seguin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Seguin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Manson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Manson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Duchene", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Duchene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pavelski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Pavelski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/resizer/fXeEQu7dS4CMlTs6CZJjsJIvL_c=/1200x630/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coxohio/RIGDRQSGJMS5TF5DGMERNHCK6I.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

We're here to share our NHL odds series, make an Avalanche-Stars Game 2 prediction, and pick while showing you how to watch.\n\nThe Avalanche rallied from a 3-0 deficit to stun the Stars 4-3 in overtime to steal Game 1. Let's quickly recap how it went down. Initially, the Stars got on the board when Ryan Suter tipped a shot into the net to give Dallas an early lead. The Stars got another when Wyatt Johnston went off the faceoff and careened a shot past Alexandar Georgiev. Then, Jamie Benn plucked a rebound off a Jason Robertson shot and into the net to give the Stars a commanding 3-0 lead.\n\nBut the Avalanche began their comeback when Valeri Nishushkin found a loose puck and put a rebound home for a powerplay goal to make it 3-1. Later, Cale Makar came off a pass from Nishushkin and slapped home a powerplay conversion to cut the deficit to 3-2. The Avs came out of the third period quickly when Nathan MacKinnon found a loose rebound and put it into the net to tie the game. Ultimately, this game needed overtime. The Avalanche ended it when Miles Wood zoomed past two Dallas defenders to fling a backhand shot past goalie Jake Oettinger for the game-winning tally.\n\nThe Avalanche won this game despite winning only 40 percent of the faceoffs. Despite that, they took advantage of any chances they had. They were 2 for 2 on the powerplant. Also, they leveled 45 hits and blocked 24 shots. Their scorers did well and hope to keep the production going.\n\nMacKinnon now has three goals and nine assists. However, he still needs to improve on the faceoff circle, as he has won just 43 draws and lost 55. Mikko Rantanen now has two goals and nine assists. Likewise, he has won 25 draws and lost 26. Makar now has three goals and nine assists after his strong effort. Meanwhile, Artturi Lehkonen currently has five goals and three assists in the playoffs. After another great game, Nishushkin has eight goals and one assist.\n\nThe defense and goaltending clamped down after a slow start in Game 1. Amazingly, their adjustments helped them complete the comeback. Georgiev is now 5-1 with a 2.94 goals-against average and a save percentage of .889. Georgiev made some great saves when it mattered late in the game to help keep the Avalanche tied.\n\nThe Avalanche will cover the spread if they continue to convert their powerplay chances. Then, they need to limit the Stars' scoring chances and avoid another slow start.\n\nWhy The Stars Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Stars dominated the faceoff circle, winning 60 percent of the draws. Additionally, they blocked 23 shots. But the offense mustered only 22 shots. Unfortunately, something seemed to slow down after their initial three-goal onslaught. Their scorers need to do more.\n\nJohnston currently has five playoff goals and three assists. He has also won 45 draws and lost 47. Miro Heiskanen has one goal and five assists. Meanwhile, Robertson has three goals and three assists.\n\nBut Benn has been the one to focus on. Significantly, he netted one goal and one assist in Game 1. Benn currently has two goals and three assists. Even more, he has been excellent in the faceoff circle, winning 52 draws and losing just 26. Benn continued to thrive, winning 13 draws and losing four.\n\nTeams usually win when they score three goals. However, the defense collapsed in Game 1. It was a poor showing on the penalty kill, as they were unable to do anything to stop Colorado, which enabled the Avs to come back. Oettinger was not the best in this game. Ultimately, he now is 4-4 with a 2.15 goals-against average and a save percentage of .915. Expect Oettinger to try to bounce back.\n\nThe Stars will cover the spread if they can take more shots and build more chances for offense. Then, they need to do a better job on the penalty kill.\n\nFinal Avalanche-Stars Game 2 Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Stars started slowly in the last series as well. Unfortunately, a trend if forming. The Avalanche and Stars have already lived up to the hype of this series after one game. Subsequently, we expect another thrilling game. The Avalanche have all the momentum after shocking the Stars. While the Stars have shown they can dominate a game, they also have struggled to hold onto a lead. We expect this game to go down to the wire again, with the Avs covering. The Stars might win Game 2. But the Avalanche will find a way to cover the spread.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rb_hayek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rb Hayek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Face-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Benn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Benn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Johnston", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyatt Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Suter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Suter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artturi_Lehkonen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artturi Lehkonen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miles Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miro_Heiskanen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miro Heiskanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Avalanche-vs-Stars-Game-1-prediction-odds-pick-how-to-watch-Stanley-Cup-Playoffs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

It felt a lot like Winnipeg. Colorado trailed 3-0 after the first period with Alexandar Georgiev allowing three goals on nine shots. Remember, three of the Avalanche's four wins in the first round were come-from-behind victories. But that formula might not work long-term against a talented Stars team. The Avs must learn to start fast if they want to advance.\n\nAAC atmosphere\n\nThere is playoff fever in Texas these days, with the Mavericks and Stars making consecutive runs inside American Airlines Center (similar to the Avalanche and Nuggets at Ball Arena). A packed house in Dallas for Game 1 brought the noise. It started with an epic pregame laser/strobe-light show. White rally towels on every seat whirled with each Dallas goal.

Took us a bit but once we found our legs, I thought we had a great second, great third,\" said MacKinnon, who tied the game at 3-3 in the opening minute of the third period.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's playoff hockey, and there is just no quit,\" said defenseman Cale Makar, who had a goal and two assists. \"If you are going to look at this game I feel like, as a group, we just stuck with it and grinded it out and found a way to win it.\"\n\nColorado had its first three-goal comeback in a playoff game since 1997. Miles Wood scored with a hard charge and a backhander 11:03 into overtime for a 4-3 win Tuesday night.\n\n\"It took us a little while to get to our game tonight,\" Avs coach Jared Bednar said. \"They capitalized on their chances in the first period.\"\n\nDallas had nine shots on goal in the first period, and came just inches short of a fourth goal. But the Stars had just seven more shots the rest of regulation before being denied six times by Alexander Georgiev in overtime before former Dallas player Andrew Cogliano got a puck out of a scrum in the corner and chipped ahead to Wood, who was screaming for the puck.\n\nThe Avalanche, the 2022 Stanley Cup champion, finished their first series in five games over Winnipeg.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stars had to go the distance before eliminating the Vegas Golden Knights, last year's champions. They won 2-1 in Game 7 at home on Sunday night.\n\n\"I knew that there would be some fatigue and a little bit of an emotional letdown coming off Game 7. I was actually surprised at how sharp we were to start, but it did hit us in the middle part of that game,\" Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. \"And you also knew that they might be a little rusty at the start. But as they got comfortable, they would get better because they've been off for a week. So I think that's probably what you saw.\"\n\nColorado had three comeback wins against the Jets in the first round, but none of those were from more than one-goal deficits.\n\nBut this wasn't the first time this season for the Avalanche to come back from a 3-0 deficit in Dallas. They were down that early in the second period back in November before scoring six unanswered goals in a 6-3 win.\n\nThe Avs were 3-1 in the regular season against Dallas. They came back in all of them, from two goals down in a 5-4 overtime win and giving up the first goal to a 5-1 win in the other.\n\nMacKinnon said it was easy to draw comparisons from those comebacks.\n\n\"I think against Dallas and then all playoffs we've been pretty good from down a few. Tonight was no different,\" he said. \"It didn't feel like they were dominating us. They had a seeing-eye shot. One went off our defensman's stick. ...

We're going to have to be even better than we were in this series. I think they obviously showed in the first round they're not scared to score goals. They've got great players. They know how to win.\"\n\nThe Avalanche are coming off a week of rest after beating the Winnipeg Jets 4-1 in their first-round series, which ended Tuesday of last week. While they'll have to hit the road to start the series, they've had more than enough time to rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeBoer said following Game 7 that he prefers to jump into the next series, especially this early in the playoffs. His team hasn't had too much success coming off long breaks, and Colorado's break could offer some time for the team to cool off.\n\nThe Avalanche led the league averaging 5.60 goals per game in the Winnipeg series. After dropping Game 1, 7-6, Colorado outscored Winnipeg 22-8 in its four consecutive wins that followed. Cale Makar, Mikko Rantanen and Nathan MacKinnon all tied for a team-high nine points.\n\nThe Stars, on the other hand, had to take Vegas to seven games just to reach the second round. They're battling some injuries to defenseman Jani Hakanp\u00e4\u00e4 and forward Mason Marchment -- and their opponents only get tougher from here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I don't think you go through a seven-game series against a team like that without it taking some toll on you,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. \"I think when you pay the bill for that toll, you never know when that's gonna be. Is that a round from now? Is that two rounds from now? Is that in the summertime? Let's hope we can push that off.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter winning Game 7s, the Stars are 2-2 all-time in the series that followed. Some may argue they'll be burnt out -- but DeBoer hopes the momentum from the Game 7 high can carry his team forward.\n\nLike the Stars learned in the Vegas series, the first few games will be telling of the style they need to play. Dallas buckled down defensively after dropping two games at home to start the playoffs. While Colorado is a familiar opponent, no one expected the offense it generated in the first round. The Stars will learn Tuesday whether that is set to continue.\n\nBut even with the limited breaks and practice time in between, there's only so much the Stars can change this time of year. They're hoping the foundation they've set over the last eight months will be enough to carry them back to the conference finals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We've had the group together all year,\" DeBoer said. \"There's good chemistry there. They understand our systems. The foundation is in place. We're not changing a lot of things series-to-series. We know how we want to play. We know what a good game looks like. That's kind of ingrained in our guys.

The Stars defeated the defending Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights in seven games, and will own home-ice advantage in this series by virtue of finishing first in the Central Division - six points ahead of Colorado.\n\nThe Avalanche won the regular-season series 3-1-0, outscoring the Stars by a 20-15 margin over those four games. Their most recent match-up came on April 7, where the Stars all but clinched the division crown after winning by a score of 7-4.\n\nThe two heavyweights represented the Western Conference in the 2020 (Stars) and 2022 (Avalanche) Stanley Cup Final, representing two of the past three championship series. It's not out of line to suggest that whichever group emerges from this series can go on to do so again in these playoffs, with the Vancouver Canucks and the Edmonton Oilers in the other series looking less complete than their counterparts.\n\nWith that, let's dive into the three keys for the Avalanche in overcoming the Stars and advancing to the third round for the second time in three seasons.\n\nThough the Golden Knights kept the Stars to a meagre 2.33 goals per game in the first round (12th out of 16 qualified teams), their offense is always a threat to activate. They scored an average of 3.59 goals per game during the regular season (third in the NHL) and had eight players score at least 20 goals, and six at least 25 times.\n\nThe Stars have done an excellent job at bridging their competitive timelines, with the key forwards from the 2020 Stanley Cup run in Joe Pavelski (age 39), Jamie Benn (age 34), and Tyler Seguin (age 32) now being supplanted by a crop of matured prospects.\n\nRoope Hintz (27) was the only one of the prime-age core to feature in the 2020 Playoffs, and he's since been joined by Jason Robertson (24), Matt Duchene, Mason Marchment, and a pair of stars-in-the-making in Wyatt Johnston (20) and Logan Stankoven (21).\n\nIt's a testament to the Stars' scouting department that they've been able to execute a rapid retool since losing in the 2020 Stanley Cup Final, and it could lead to a championship as soon as this season.\n\nIt was the play of Johnston that swung a very tight first-round affair, with the 20-year-old leading the series in goals (four) and shots (27) while tying for the lead in points (seven). It shouldn't come as a surprise given that he also led the Stars with 32 goals during the regular season, but he's announced himself to the hockey world with his performance against the defending Stanley Cup champions.\n\nThough the Jets were not without their offensive weapons, the Stars are a different animal to contain. Their forward group is deeper and more defensively oriented, meaning that the Avalanche must be purposeful with their movement and passing.\n\nThe Avalanche have an advantage in terms of elite talent and will hope that their game-breakers can single-handedly decide what is sure to be a more tightly contested series compared to the first round. A reinforced (and healthier) supporting cast tore the Jets' defensive structure to shreds and will be just as much of a test for the Stars in this series.\n\nNathan MacKinnon established a new franchise record with 140 points during the regular season and tallied nine points in five games against the Jets. Apart from their superstar center, the Avalanche had seven other players score at least two goals in the first round, with Valeri Nichushkin (seven goals in five games) and the underrated Artturi Lehkonen (five in five) in particular wreaking havoc around the Jets' crease.\n\nOther than Mikko Rantanen (nine points in five games) fully recovering from a concussion sustained prior to the playoffs, the play of Casey Mittelstadt (six points in five games) could be the key to matching Dallas' depth. He's meshed well with the Avalanche's top-six, and will have to maintain his strong outings to date with the continued absence of injured winger Jonathan Drouin.\n\nBoth teams will trot out an enviable parade of offensive stars up front over the course of the series. The Stars will hope that rolling four dependable lines can tilt the ice against the Avalanche's elite talent. The outcome of this particular battle could be a deciding factor in who advances to the third round.\n\nDespite arguably boasting the deepest forward group in the league, the Stars generate a great deal of their five-on-five offense from the defensive zone, relying on a collection of dynamic puck-moving defensemen to carry the puck from zone to zone.\n\nMany will be familiar with 24-year-old rearguard Miro Heiskanen, who scored 26 points in 27 playoff games as the Stars came within two wins of capturing the second Stanley Cup in franchise history. He's accumulated 73 career playoff games before the age of 25, and is one of the few defensemen around the league who can give the Avalanche's Cale Makar a run for his money when it comes to consideration for the Norris Trophy.\n\nWhat has elevated the Stars' floor in terms of the blue line is the ascension of 22-year-old Thomas Harley, who broke out with 47 points in 79 games this season. He's been limited to a single point in the 2024 Playoffs, but his aggressive bursts up ice have given the Stars another play-making presence on the back end.\n\nThose two young stars headline a solid defensive group rounded out by Esa Lindell and decorated veterans in Ryan Suter and Chris Tanev, the latter of which came over in a trade with the Calgary Flames at the trade deadline.\n\nWhat's been notable is that head coach Peter DeBoer has essentially utilized a five-man rotation on the blue line with four defenders averaging 23 minutes or more. Nils Lundkvist has featured in every game of the postseason so far, but averaged under five minutes per game during the first round and played in just over three minutes in Game 7 against the Golden Knights. He's been stapled to the bench and represents a clear target for the Avalanche when they have last change at home.\n\nIn comparison, Colorado had Makar and Devon Toews exceed 23 minutes per game in Round 1, and had five defensemen average more than 17 minutes per game. The Avalanche clearly have their thoroughbreds, but have spread out even-strength and special teams duty more evenly.\n\nLet's return to the Stars' breakout strategy. According to data tracked by AllThreeZones, they ranked first in the NHL in terms of defensive zone retrievals attempted and zone exits completed per-60-minutes, also ranking above-average in terms of exits completed with possession. They leaned heavily on their defensemen to either carry or pass the puck out, a strategy which proved to be a success due to their skating and puck-handling abilities.\n\nHarley and Heiskanen were the leaders in this regard, with Harley employing a much riskier style than the calculating Heiskanen. Of the Stars' defenders, only Suter ranked below-average in terms of retrievals which translated into exits with possession. Lindell was more no-nonsense than his teammates, ranking second in the league in clears per-60, but well below-average in exits with possession.\n\nTo remedy this imbalance, general manager Jim Nill acquired the veteran Tanev at the deadline. Despite being on the back end of his career, Tanev has continued to be a very effective puck-mover. Despite being saddled with the heaviest transition workload in the league with the Flames, the 34-year-old graded out well above-average in generating controlled zone exits. His composure and patience give the Stars three very capable puck-moving defenders and will make it much more difficult for the Avalanche to disrupt their breakout attempts.\n\nThey must do what they can to funnel dump-ins away from Heiskanen and Tanev and towards one of the other two defensemen, or three if Lundkvist actually plays. Harley is a riverboat gambler, and could be forced into high-danger turnovers if attacked with multiple forecheckers, but he possesses the ability to evade aggressive schemes.\n\nIf the Avalanche can stifle the Stars' breakouts, they may be able to extend possessions in the offensive zone. Tanev and Suter could be worn down after another series in which they have to bear the brunt of a shorter defensive rotation. Let's see how this battle plays out.\n\nWe've focused a lot on the Stars to this point, so let's move over to something the Avalanche have greater control over: the power play. The Avalanche devoured the Jets penalty kill in Round 1, capitalizing on a shorthanded unit which ranked in the bottom-half of the league by efficiency during the regular season. They scored on six of 16 total opportunities and ranked second in the first round by overall efficiency (37.5%), maintaining their top-10 conversion from the regular season.\n\nThe Stars' penalty kill ranked eighth (82%) in the regular season, but struggled to repel the Golden Knights' power play in Round 1, only killing off eight of Vegas' 11 chances on the power play.\n\nLet's compare the Avalanche's power play and the Stars' penalty kill units in terms of the rates at which they generated and conceded goals (GF/GA) shots (SF/SA), expected goals (xGF/xGA), scoring chances (SCF/A), and high-danger chances (HDCF/A) during the regular season.\n\nDespite the Stars' subpar penalty-killing in Round 1, they graded out as one of the NHL's top units during the regular season as a result of ranking in the top 10 or top five in a number of scoring chance suppression categories.\n\nGoaltending can mask a poorly-structured penalty kill or sabotage the most expertly-constructed scheme, but the Stars are fortunate to have the best of both worlds. They don't concede much by way of chance quantity or quality, and have one of the best goaltenders backstopping them in Jake Oettinger. The American netminder posted a .925 save percentage (SV%) in the first round, but did so after conceding four goals in Game 1. He only allowed 10 goals in six games the rest of the way (.942 SV%) and looks unbeatable at the moment.\n\nThe Avalanche accumulated the third-most minutes on the power play this season while the Stars spent the 19th-most minutes shorthanded, creating tension between effective penalty-drawers and disciplined defenders. MacKinnon (15th), Makar (42nd), Wood (52nd), and Rantanen (71st) all ranked in the top 75 of skaters by penalties drawn during the regular season and will look to use their speed and size to lure the Stars into taking untimely infractions.\n\nThe Stars have been a very strong defensive team at five-on-five and expertly defend inside their own zone despite conceding the highest rate of zone entries in the league. The Avalanche may find it difficult to penetrate the Stars' shell at even strength, meaning the special teams battlefield should play a key role in determining who moves onto the Western Conference Final.\n\nBoth the Avalanche and the Stars embody the best of the modern era of hockey, blending speed, skill, and toughness en route to recent postseason success. Colorado is driven by two of the NHL's most dynamic offensive figures, while the Stars overwhelm through balanced depth up front.\n\nConsidering the strength of their respective first-round opponents, both clubs completed impressive series wins over talented adversaries and bolstered their Stanley Cup credentials going forward.\n\nThere are genuine stars at nearly every position on both sides, spearheaded by two of the sport's most-esteemed coaches, and legacy-defining storylines galore.

Avs look to...", "body": "The Dallas Stars are in an all-too familiar hole.\n\nThis is their sixth consecutive playoff series over three postseasons, the fourth at home, that they go into Game 2 after losing the opener.\n\n\"It's not ideal, we know that. And it's definitely not the plan,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said Wednesday.\n\n\"You\u00b4re kind of playing with fire when you put yourself in that position enough,\" forward Joe Pavelski said.\n\nWhen they play Game 2 of their second-round Western Conference series against Colorado on Thursday night (9:30 p.m. ET/TNT), the Stars will try to avoid a repeat of the opening round. Two weeks ago, they lost the first two games at home to Vegas, last year\u00b4s Stanley Cup champion, though they did fight back to win in seven games.\n\nIn the only other NHL playoff game Thursday, the Carolina Hurricanes go home in their own 0-2 hole to the Rangers. New York has won all six of its games this postseason after a 4-3 double-overtime victory Tuesday night.\n\nDallas Stars head coach Pete DeBoer, center standing, Matt Duchene (95), Logan Stankoven (11) and Tyler Seguin (91) watch play in the third period in Game 2 of an NHL hockey Stanley Cup second-round playoff series against the Colorado Avalanche in Dallas, Tuesday, May 7, 2024. (AP Photo/LM Otero)\n\nDallas twice last year lost Game 1 at home, but won the second one each series on way to rebounding to advance: in six games against Minnesota, and seven over Seattle.\n\nThe 2022 Cup champion Avalanche have won five games in a row since opening these playoffs with a wild 7-6 loss at Winnipeg. Colorado won 4-3 in overtime at Dallas, after a full week between games and then trailing 3-0 in the first period.\n\n\"I definitely feel better when I\u00b4m in a rhythm,\" said Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon, who scored the game-tying goal in the first minute of the third period. \"I don\u00b4t love taking time off. But I think we\u00b4ll feel better as we play (Games) 2-3-4.\"\n\nColorado has four players that have tallied points in every game this postseason: league MVP finalist MacKinnon, defenseman Cale Makar, former Stars first-round draft pick Valeri Nichushkin and Mikko Rantannen. All have multiple goals.\n\nThe Stars are still waiting for some of their big scorers to get going this postseason.\n\nPavelski, whose 73 career playoff goals are the most ever for a U.S.-born player and the most among active players, still doesn't have one this postseason and just got his first assist in Game 1 against the Avs. Matt Duchene has only one goal, and the lone score for Roope Hintz without any assists was an empty-net goal against Vegas. Rookie Logan Stankoven had six goals his first 12 games after his NHL debut in late February, but hasn't found the net since - the last 12 regular-season games and eight playoff games.\n\n\"The strength of our team all year has been if Roope Hintz's line doesn\u00b4t score, then Matt Duchene's line scores. If Matt Duchene's line doesn\u00b4t score, then Wyatt Johnston\u00b4s line scores. If none of those guys score, our fourth line scores,\" DeBoer said. \"Our depth has to show up in this series.\"\n\nThe special-teams battle has been a rout so far. Carolina must find a way to close that gap.\n\nThe teams ranked in the top three in the regular season on both the power play and the penalty kill, including Carolina leading the league on the kill (86.4%). Yet the Presidents\u00b4 Trophy-winning Rangers have two goals on the power play in each of the first two games while the Hurricanes are 0 for 10, going 0 for 5 in both games.\n\n\"At this time of year, special teams can win a series, win games,\" Rangers defenseman Adam Fox said after Tuesday\u00b4s double-overtime win decided on - what else? - a power-play goal.\n\nAs Carolina forward Martin Necas said Wednesday: \"Everybody knows it\u00b4s about the power plays and PKs. So far, they crushed us in those.\"\n\nCarolina has managed a total of 10 shots on goal on the power play so far.\n\n\"We\u00b4ve got to get a little more at the net, a little more inside,\" coach Rod Brind\u00b4Amour said. \"They\u00b4re keeping us to the outside a little too much and we\u00b4re settling for that.\"\n\nThe Hurricanes have plenty of stats that have gone in their favor, posting a 20-shot advantage (82-62) and a 188-142 edge in shot attempts. Carolina has also outscored the Rangers in 5-on-5 play (5-4) and even strength (6-4), while also doubling the Rangers in shots on goal (30-15) in the third period.\n\nCarolina has also won 53.1% of faceoffs through the two games, reversing road troubles from the first-round series against the New York Islanders (35%).\n\n\"Obviously it\u00b4s frustrating because you don\u00b4t feel like you deserve to lose two in a row there,\" Necas said. \"Special teams decided both of the games and they were better at those.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Aaron Beard contributed to this report.\n\nAP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL\n\nColorado Avalanche's Artturi Lehkonen (62), Mikko Rantanen, second from left, Cale Makar (8) and Valeri Nichushkin (13) celbrate a goal scored by Makar in the second period in Game 2 of an NHL hockey Stanley Cup second-round playoff series against the Dallas Stars in Dallas, Tuesday, May 7, 2024.

The margins in this series ahead of Game 1 are much, much tighter. All six of these categories could say \"even\" at the end of them, and it wouldn't entirely be a bit.\n\nColorado's forwards were awesome against Winnipeg. All four lines had big games. The second line dominated the Jets' top guys. Valeri Nichushkin and Artturi Lehkonen scored in all five games. Dallas doesn't have a Nathan MacKinnon or a Mikko Rantanen, but the Stars are very deep up front. Wyatt Johnston and Logan Stankoven are burgeoning stars who gave the Avs all they could handle late in the regular season. Radek Faksa came back from injury and scored in Game 7 against Vegas, but he could be on the fourth line. Will the Avs be able to wear down some of the older guys like Joe Pavelski, Jamie Benn, Matt Duchene and Tyler Seguin with their collective speed after they just survived a seven-game war with a physical Vegas club? Will Mason Marchment have an impact on this series? What about Jonathan Drouin? Edge: Avalanche\n\nDevon Toews is not the second-best defenseman in this series. If he plays as well as he did in the first round, though, that would be big for the Avs. Miro Heiskainen is fantastic and should push Cale Makar in the Norris Trophy race for the next half-decade. Thomas Harley is another young, emerging star. Josh Manson and Samuel Girard were great against the Jets, and they'll need to be again. Here's where it gets interesting: The Stars have Chris Tanev on the second pair, and he's been lights out for them. He's better than every Jets defenseman not named Josh Morrissey. But, the Stars also basically don't play their No. 6 guy, Nils Lundkvist. Will their excellent top five be able to survive a second straight long, taxing series? Just getting a solid 15 minutes a night from Jack Johnson could be the difference in the series. Edge: Avalanche\n\nBefore this season, Jake Oettinger had a longer track record of success as a No. 1 goalie and probably ranked higher on most pundit's \"best goalies\" lists. Like Alexandar Georgiev, Oettinger did not have a great regular season. Georgiev finished 13th among the 34 goalies who played at least 40 games in goals saved above expected, per Money Puck. Oettinger was 21st. Both were just OK in the 2023 playoffs. Both goalies had a rough Game 1 to start this postseason. Both have been much better since. Oettinger has had multiple postseasons where he had to play through multiple rounds, while this is the first for Georgiev. Edge: Stars\n\nThese two teams finished almost dead even in power-play proficiency in the regular season. Valeri Nichushkin might be the best net-front guy in the NHL in 2024. Joe Pavelski might be the best ever, and he's still got it. The Avs did score 10 more times with the extra man, though, because they had 38 more opportunities. Colorado also had two more power plays than Dallas in the opening round, despite playing two fewer games. How the series is officiated could be a factor in who emerges on top. Edge: Avalanche\n\nThe Stars allowed 10 fewer shorthanded goals during the regular season. Seriously, we're splitting atoms between these teams. Colorado's penalty kill was in the top 10 for much of the season before slipping just outside it. Radek Faksa was Dallas' top PK forward by time on ice per game in the regular season, so his getting healthy could be big. The Stars also scored 12 times shorthanded this season, while the Avalanche yielded the fourth-most expected goals against while playing 5-on-4, per Natural Stat Trick. One shorthanded goal at the right (or wrong) time could swing this series. Edge: Stars\n\nThese are two of the best coaches in the sport. Among active coaches with more than 20 playoff games on their resume, Jared Bednar is first in winning percentage (47-28, .627). Pete DeBeor is third (82-67, .550). If the Stars win this series and two conference final games, DeBeor will pass Jon Cooper (who is second in winning percentage) for the most playoff wins among active coaches. If they win the Stanley Cup, he'd be tied for sixth all-time with Darryl Sutter and Pat Quinn. Bednar has a championship. DeBeor does not. But the Dallas coach is now 8-0 in Game 7s, and he's been to the conference finals six times with four different organizations. Edge: Stars\n\nIn an about-face from their first-round series, the Avs will encounter a Dallas Stars club that boasts every bit as much firepower as they do. The Avalanche and Stars finished first and third, respectively in goals scored per game during the regular season, with the Avs power play (24.5%) only slightly more effective than the Stars (24.2). The one difference? Colorado was able to maintain, and even augment, its offensive production in the first round of the playoffs, netting 28 goals in just five games against one of the league's most formidable defenses. As for the Stars? They managed just 16 goals in a knock-down, drag-out seven-game series against Vegas.\n\nThe Stars' presumed advantage entering this postseason was their superior depth scoring. While Dallas had just two 30-goal scorers this season -- centers Wyatt Johnston (32) and Roope Hintz (30) -- six others also topped 20. The Avs, by comparison, had four reach the 20-goal plateau. Yet in the first round of the playoffs, it was the Avs whose depth emerged as a critical factor in winning four straight vs. the Jets. Colorado had eight score two or more goals over five games, with the the second line of center Casey Mittelstadt (6 points) and wings Artturi Lehkonen (8 points) and Zach Parise (2 points) proving to be formidable. Despite playing two more games, the Stars produced just three multi-goal scorers. So, perhaps, the advantage belongs to Colorado?\n\nA couple of weeks ago, one of the big questions facing the Avs was whether or not they could reverse the Jets' regular-season dominance (3-0, plus-13 margin in season series). Now the roles are reversed. Colorado is the team that held a strong grip on the regular-season series, beating the Stars three times in four meetings, including an overtime winner from Nathan MacKinnon in a 5-4 triumph on Jan. 4. Of course, only one of those meetings came after the early March trade deadline. And the Stars won that one convincingly, 7-4, at Ball Arena on April 7. Does veteran defenseman Chris Tanev really make that much of a difference?\n\nThe other big question facing the Avs heading into the postseason: Is goaltender Alexandar Georgiev broken? Colorado's netminder, of course, answered that emphatically after a shaky Game 1 against the Jets, allowing just eight goals over the next four games with a .931 save percentage. Dallas goaltender Jake Oettinger had his own troubles with inconsistency during the regular season but responded with a brilliant seven-game series against Vegas that saw him post a .925 save percentage while allowing 1.95 goals per game. Can either goaltender keep that up against their opponents' relentless attacks? The answer to that question might decide this series.\n\nBy the time the puck drops on Game 1 Tuesday night, the Avs will have gone a full week without playing a game. While that rest was no doubt welcome for a roster nursing a few bumps and bruises, that could also produce at least a period or two of rust against a Stars team that just wrapped up its series with Vegas on Sunday. The other side of that coin? With their second-round series rotating with games every other day all the way through Game 7, the Stars will have zero opportunity to catch their breath. And that can only be an advantage for the well-rested Avs.\n\nCorey Masisak, Avalanche beat writer: Unless the victor leaves this series too battered and injured, the team that survives this battle could be the favorite to win the Stanley Cup. The Stars are Winnipeg-plus, with even better depth and more collective postseason success. The Avs still have a star-power advantage, but not nearly as big of one on the back end as they did against the Jets. And they probably don't want to face a Game 7 against a coach who is 8-0 in them. Avs in six.\n\nTroy Renck, sports columnist: The Avs arrive rested, ready and rebounding like Dennis Rodman. They won four straight to finish off the Jets, and won three of four games vs. the Stars during the season. Dallas went the distance with the Knights. The momentum might carry over in Game 1, but not the entire series. The Avs' stars will continue to simmer, but second-line center Casey Mittelstadt is an X-factor. He delivered six points in the first round. Similar production will help overcome the inevitable concern about goalie Alexander Georgiev. Avs in seven.\n\nKyle Newman, sports reporter: After the Avs pummeled the Jets in Round 1 -- and the Stars had to grind out a seven-game series win over Vegas -- all the momentum, and fresh legs, should be with Colorado. With 28 goals over five games against Winnipeg, I don't see the Stars being able to contain the Avalanche's offensive onslaught. During the regular season series between the two teams, which Colorado won 3-1, the Avs racked up 20 goals in a four-game span. The top-seeded Stars are going home, especially considering Alexandar Georgiev continues to play well in net for Colorado following his Game 1 dud against Winnipeg. Avs in 6.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corey_masisak@denverpost.com", "name": "Corey Masisak", "type": "author",

Regardless of how he gets his offense, MacKinnon figures to be heavily involved in the Avalanche's progress in the playoffs.\n\nOettinger ends the Golden Knights' season\n\nJake Oettinger stopped 22 of 23 shots in Sunday's 2-1 win over the Golden Knights in Game 7. Things looked bleak for the Stars after they dropped the first two games of the series, but Oettinger steadied himself and the team by winning four of the last five contests. He's allowed two or fewer goals in six straight games and owns a 1.95 GAA and a .925 save percentage through seven playoff outings. Oettinger won't have much time to rest, as the Stars' second-round series versus the Avalanche begins in Dallas on Tuesday.\n\nAvalanche vs. Stars Game 1 Betting Trends:\n\nThe total has gone OVER in 10 of Colorado's last 12 games\n\nOver/Under has gone UNDER in 16 of Dallas' last 21 games\n\nThe total has gone OVER in 19 of Colorado's last 26 games on the road\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 10 of Dallas' last 12 games at home\n\nAvalanche vs. Stars Game 1 Betting Prediction\n\nTake Colorado.

In the second round, they could have their backs against the wall again as they take on the second-most recent team to win a Stanley Cup; the Colorado Avalanche are in town.\n\nThe Avalanche, who mopped the floor in their first-round series against the Winnipeg Jets in five games, are no easy task. How can the Stars pull off a series victory and return to the Western Conference Final for the second straight season?\n\nWhat made the Golden Knights such a formidable foe for the Stars was their ability to play such a low-scoring game. Dallas finished the 2023-24 regular season third in NHL scoring with an average of 3.58 goals per game, but that number cratered in the postseason once Vegas was on their plate. Despite winning the series, they had an average of 2.67 goals per game.\n\nIt would be inaccurate to chalk Dallas' scoring struggles down to anything but the Golden Knights being a strong defensive team. They had an elite 57.9 expected goals percentage (xGF%), which was by far the best for any team that had a seven-game series.\n\nVegas is a direct contradiction to the way the Avalanche play. They had the third-best offense in the NHL based on expected goals for and the ninth-worst defense based on expected goals against. The Golden Knights beat contenders by playing low-event hockey, while the Avalanche beat contenders by playing high-event hockey. This will certainly be an adjustment for the Stars.\n\nIn this series, the Stars will need some more offense. Playing defense isn't going to be nearly as easy, so they will be in a position to outscore some of their problems. Against Vegas, they didn't get a lot of that offense from individual players.\n\nOnly three of 20 Dallas skaters had more than three points in the series, and only one of them had more than five. A lot of key players for the Stars failed to score, with Matt Duchene, Thomas Harley, Roope Hintz, and Joe Pavelski combining for two goals and two assists for four points in 28 games. Just for reference, they combined for four goals and 13 assists for 17 points in the Stars' last seven games of the regular season. Losing this amount of offense is significant, and it will have to change.\n\nEven a player like Jason Robertson, who had a great series, could use a boost in production. He had three goals and five points overall, but he wasn't too productive after his first couple of games. If all of this changes, Dallas could go toe-to-toe with Colorado's offense.\n\nThe Stars' biggest hero in the first round was one of the youngest players in the playoffs: 20-year-old Wyatt Johnston. He stole the show and made a league-wide name for himself, scoring an overtime-winning goal and seven points in total to take down the Golden Knights. After the regular season, it seemed as though he could take that next step into being a first-line caliber player in 2024-25. However, he has done so early.\n\nRelated: Dallas Stars' Wyatt Johnston Showing Elite Potential\n\nWhether or not he can dominate again is the big topic of discussion. He has the talent to be one of the Stars' best players in the postseason despite his age; that much is apparent. But can he really be a point-per-game player in the playoffs overall?\n\nWhen the Stars needed a big goal, Johnston was right there. At least to some degree, there should be confidence that he can continue that in the second round. He has officially emerged as a core player for Dallas, perhaps being the best centerman on their roster ahead of Hintz and Tyler Seguin.\n\nIf Johnston can be anywhere as good as he was in the first round, he will be doing more than what should be required from him. He was arguably the best skater for either team in the Vegas series, so matching his level of dominance shouldn't be the expectation. However, some scoring production will be needed. Falling off a cliff would be a death sentence for the Stars - there is some weight on his shoulders now.\n\nEarly on against the Golden Knights, goaltender Jake Oettinger was having a rotten series. Before Game 3, he had a save percentage (SV%) of .850 and a 3.10 goals-against average (GAA). From Game 3 onward, he had a .946 SV% and a 1.53 GAA. He went from a liability to the difference-maker of the series in a flash, being everything Dallas could have asked for and much, much more.\n\nWhile Oettinger shouldn't be expected to be essentially flawless like he was against the Golden Knights after his early struggles, he needs to at least be decent. The Avalanche have a much scarier offense than Vegas - it won't be easy to keep pucks out of the net. At the same time, he can't actively cost his team games.\n\nThe Golden Knights had trouble generating high-quality looks against the Stars after the first couple of games, and that was noticeable in Oettinger's stats. He usually has no problem with low-danger opportunities, so once his defense started to play better he did the same.\n\nUnfortunately, the Avalanche are very good at generating quality scoring chances. Connor Hellebuyck, a 2023-24 Vezina Trophy finalist, faced 51 high-danger shots, ranking second in the playoffs. As a result, the Avalanche had their way with the once-dominant goaltender - he had a .865 SV% in the postseason.\n\nIf the Stars aren't careful, this can happen to them too. Dallas has a strong defense, but they really can't afford to have a high-danger shootout with the Avalanche. They can hold their ground as they are one of the best offensive teams in the NHL, but they don't have a superstar quite like Nathan MacKinnon, either. He is virtually unstoppable once he gets going; Oettinger has to shine.\n\nEven though this is just a second-round series, it might end up being the most thrilling of the postseason. It begins on May 7 at American Airlines Center in Dallas. They will want to get off to a better start this time.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeywriters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey Writers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_giampietro@thehockeywriters.com", "name": "Justin Giampietro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Johnston", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyatt Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHL_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NHL Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Harley_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Harley (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Duchene", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Duchene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pavelski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Pavelski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Hellebuyck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor Hellebuyck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centre (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Seguin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Seguin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s3951.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wyatt-Johnston-Stars-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 5911, "textEnd": 5916}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Not two. Not three. But six. That's how many consecutive Game 1's the Dallas Stars have lost following Tuesday night's 4-3 overtime loss to the Colorado Avalanche in the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nThe Stars jumped to a 3-0 lead in the first period after goals from Ryan Suter, Wyatt Johnston and Jamie Benn, only to then go scoreless the rest of the way and allowing four straight goals by the Avalanche, including the winner from Miles Wood nearly nine minutes into overtime.\n\n\"We had that game under control, and we let it slip away, but we've seen that in the regular season against them,\" Stars forward Matt Duchene told reporters. \"We had two games like that, so we have bounce back here and split the homestand here.\"\n\nThe Avalanche jumpstarted their comeback by capitalizing on their power-play chances. Valeri Nichushkin trimmed the lead to 3-1 a little more than five minutes into the second period, and Cale Makar cut it to 3-2 nearly four minutes later.\n\nAvalanche star center Nathan MacKinnon, who was named one of the three Hart Trophy finalists Tuesday, scored the tying goal less than a minute into the third period.\n\n\"They're a great power play,\" Benn said. \"They've got a lot of skill. We'll have to watch some video, learn from it, and move on.\"\n\nThere were moments in overtime when the Avalanche struggled to find a clear shot before Wood found space on a breakaway and beat Stars goaltender Jake Oettinger for the game-winning goal.\n\n\"We didn't know we could come back, but we wanted to at least try,\" MacKinnon said after the game.\n\nLearning how to make the necessary adjustments following a Game 1 loss has proved to be a familiar theme for the Stars.\n\nThe last time they won Game 1 of a playoff series came in 2020, when they took Game 1 of the Stanley Cup final against the Tampa Bay Lightning in a series they would lose in six games.\n\nThey opened the 2022 playoffs with a Game 1 loss to the Calgary Flames and lost in seven games. Last season saw them open the playoffs with a Game 1 loss in double overtime in the first round to the Minnesota Wild before winning the series in six games. They lost Game 1 in of the second round in overtime to the Seattle Kraken before winning that series in seven games en route to reaching the Western Conference finals, where they lost another Game 1 that went into overtime to the Vegas Golden Knights and lost the series in six games.\n\nFast forward to this year's playoffs. The Stars lost the first two games of their opening-round series to the Golden Knights before ousting the defending Stanley Cup champions in the first round. And now they've pushed that streak to six straight Game 1 defeats with a loss to the Avalanche.\n\n\"I think you learn about each other as a series goes on, and what we know about that team is what happened tonight,\" DeBoer said. \"I think we had the lead. ...

Dallas might have gotten off to a 3-0 start, but for the third time this season, the Avalanche came from behind in the Stars building to win the game. In overtime, the Stars bounced back, but Alexandar Georgiev saved his best for the extra period, making a few huge saves to keep the game going. A simple chip out sprung Miles Wood on a break, who burst past Miro Heiskanen and beat Jake Oettinger, giving the Avalanche the game one victory.\n\nValeri Nichushkin, Nathan MacKinnon, and Cale Makar scored the other goals for Colorado, while Georgiev made 19 saves in net.\n\nFirst Period\n\nIt could have been the adrenaline of the situation, but the Avalanche came out skating with the Stars, despite having a week off.\n\nSoon after, the rust started to show. Then, the frustration.\n\nAt 7:26, Colorado failed to clear the puck out of their own end, and Matt Duchene sent it to an empty side of the ice. Ryan Suter corralled it, and then took his time, allowing a screen to set up. Once that screen set up, he sent a wrister through to the net, which escaped everyone, including Georgiev, making it 1-0 Stars.\n\nThat was just the beginning. A little over three minutes later, Artturi Lehkonen missed an exit pass, leading to an icing on the Avalanche. On the ensuing face-off, Jamie Benn beat Casey Mittelstadt cleanly. Joe Pavelski tapped it to Wyatt Johnston, the Stars top scorer, who let a quick shot go. It didn't look terribly dangerous, but it deflected off Cale Makar past Georgiev, making it 2-0.\n\nRight about here is when the frustration set in. At one point, Devon Toews took a stick up high that went uncalled, which might explain their frustration with some of the upcoming calls. Mikko Rantanen, while leaving the ice, tripped up Evgeni Dadonov, giving the Stars the first powerplay of the night. 28 seconds into that powerplay, Yakov Trenin caught Jason Robertson with a stick up high, giving the Stars a two-man advantage. Robertson definitely sold the call, but the stick got his helmet, so not much you can do about that.\n\nDallas took advantage, which is what good teams do on a 5-on-3. Robertson's shot bounced off Jamie Benn and in, making it 3-0 for the home team. Another Rantanen penalty late gave them a third powerplay, and Benn nearly made it 4-0, but Josh Manson stopped the puck right at the goal line with around five seconds left, keeping it 3-0 heading into the intermission.\n\nSecond Period\n\nIt's fair to say the Avalanche shook off whatever rust they had in the intermission, because they came out in the second a completely different team.\n\nIt didn't hurt that they got a few powerplays to get some momentum going, with the first coming early in the period.\n\nWith Evgeni Dadonov in the box, the Avalanche needed just 13 seconds to get on the board. Wyatt Johnston broke his stick off the face-off, giving Colorado more of an advantage. Cale Makar nearly lost the puck, but because it was Johnston covering him, he was able to pick it back up, sending a shot towards Oettinger. He made the initial save, but the puck bounced around and found none other than Valeri Nichushkin at the side of the net, who sent it top shelf to make it 3-1. Nichushkin has scored in every single playoff game so far for the Avalanche.\n\nA few minutes later, Nichushkin drew a penalty driving the net, and Cale Makar did what Cale Makar does. Roope Hintz had a rush the other way, but Makar got back to slow him down, and Hintz turned the puck back over. Nichushkin hit a late arriving Makar, who sent a screened shot over Oettinger's glove, cutting the Stars lead to one.\n\nColorado kept pushing, but couldn't find the equalizer before the end of the second. A MacKinnon post was as close as they would get, setting up a big third period.\n\nThird Period\n\nIt didn't take long at all for this game to get tied up.\n\n39 seconds into the period, a Cale Makar shot hit Mikko Rantanen's backside, bouncing right to a wide open MacKinnon, who shot the puck into an empty cage, tying the game at three. Slowly but surely, Dallas' lead was gone, something the Avalanche have done on many occasions this year. They're never out of a game, even if they start slow.\n\nThe rest of the period was super low event. Colorado only surrendered four shots on net, while the Stars only gave up six. The closest Colorado came to taking the lead was a Rantanen shot off the face-off that hit the crossbar. Roope Hintz missed the net on a great rush late in the period, but this game wasn't meant to end in regulation. For the first this postseason, the Avalanche would head to overtime.\n\nColorado's netminder made several huge saves in the extra period, as the Stars controlled most of the play after being held to just seven shots on net over the last two periods. Tyler Seguin couldn't beat the stretched out leg of Georgiev on a cross-ice pass, and then Wyatt Johnston was stopped all alone in front to keep the game going.\n\nIt just takes one shot, though. After an extended shift in the defensive zone, Andrew Cogliano flipped the puck out into the neutral zone, giving Miles Wood the opportunity to catch up to it. In any race, I'm taking Wood over the competition, and he won this one, beating Heiskanen to the puck. Wood raced in, and with Oettinger backing into his net, beat him on the backhand, giving the Avalanche the Game One victory.\n\nColorado will likely take tomorrow off after going to extra time, and Game Two takes place on Thursday night at 7:30 PM MST.", "source": {"uri": "coloradohockeynow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Hockey Now"}, "authors": [{"uri": "evan_rawal@coloradohockeynow.com", "name": "Evan Rawal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Benn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Benn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Johnston", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyatt Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgenii_Dadonov", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evgenii Dadonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Duchene", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Duchene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Suter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Suter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_Toews", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devon Toews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Manson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Manson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miro_Heiskanen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miro Heiskanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pavelski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Pavelski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Mittelstadt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casey Mittelstadt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artturi_Lehkonen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artturi Lehkonen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miles Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roope_Hintz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roope Hintz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cogliano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Cogliano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://coloradohockeynow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/IMG_0014-scaled.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

FREE LIVE STREAM, Time, TV, Channel for Stanley Cup Playoffs", "body": "The Dallas Stars face the Colorado Avalanche in Game 1 of the second round of the NHL playoffs at American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, on Tuesday, May 7, 2024 (5/7/24).\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars got one day off between their Game 7 victory over last year's Stanley Cup champion, and the start of what could be a drastically different second round in the Western Conference playoffs against well-rested 2022 champ Colorado.\n\nCoach Pete DeBoer and the top-seeded Stars won a tight series against Vegas when each team scored 16 goals. They now face the Avalanche, who by time the puck drops for Game 1 on Tuesday night will have gone a full week since wrapping up their opening round with 28 goals in five games against one of the league's top defensive teams.\n\n\"We're going to have to work ourselves into the series to see how we're going to have to win,\" DeBoer said Monday. \"My initial reaction, just watching what they did to Winnipeg, is I don't think we want to get in a track meet. ... At the same time, we're not going to sit and try to defend in the entire series. I think we've got other layers to our game.\"\n\nDallas can score, too, with a franchise-record eight 20-goal scorers in the regular season and ranking third in the NHL at 3.59 goals per game. The Avs had a league-high 3.68.\n\nWhile the Stars hope to have an advantage going right from one series to another one, the Avalanche are drawing on experience from long layoffs during their 2022 Stanley Cup title run. They had a break of more than a week between the first and second rounds, and another before the final when they knocked off Tampa Bay in six games.\n\n\"We approached this week the same as we did then,\" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"The way you handle every situation it's not just like, you know, willy-nilly, you're trying to think of the best way to do it. You're gathering information from your team on rest, work, how they're feeling, what we can go over, just trying to fine-tune everything so we're ready to go when the puck drops.\"\n\nIn veteran center Nathan MacKinnon's view, the Avs should be ready for one thing: \"Their best, hardest game,\" he said. \"We're prepared to work our butts off and compete. We expect a very, very, very hard series. But we're confident in ourselves. We feel like we have a deep team and we get the job done.\"\n\nBIG SCORERS\n\nValeri Nichushkin had seven goals, the most by the 12 different Colorado players that found the net in the opening round. Nichushkin and Artturi Lehkonen are the first teammates in NHL history with simultaneous five-game goal streaks to open a postseason.\n\nOnly three other teams have opened the playoffs with at least five goals in each of their first five games. The Avs are the first since the 1994 New York Rangers, who then won their last Stanley Cup title.\n\nWinnipeg had allowed an NHL-low 2.41 goals a game in the regular season, while standout goalie Connor Hellebuyck had a 2.39 goals-against average in his 60 games.\n\nGOALIES\n\nStars goalie Jake Oettinger had a 1.95 goals-against average and .925 save percentage against the Knights, and stopped 73 of 74 shots in the third period or overtime.\n\nOettinger allowed more than two goals only once over the last 11 regular-season games. The lone exception was a 7-4 win at Colorado on April 7 -- he allowed 14 goals in three regular-season appearances against the Avs.\n\n\"The third period-overtime numbers show what we already knew here, that he's a rise-to-the-occasion guy,\" DeBoer said. \"He recognizes the big moments, the important times of a series, of a game. And he finds another level for us, regardless of what's happened before.\"\n\nColorado was 3-1 this season against the Stars, with Alexander Georgiev in net for all of them, also allowing 14 goals with an extra game. He had a 3.03 GAA and .893 save percentage in the first round against Winnipeg.\n\nVETS SEEKING CUP\n\nAvalanche forward Zach Parise and Dallas defenseman Ryan Suter are former teammates and good friends who still hope to hoist the Stanley Cup for the first time.\n\nParise and Suter, both 39 years old, were together for nine seasons with the Minnesota Wild from 2012-21.\n\nSuter is in his third season with Dallas, where he signed in free agency after leaving the Wild, and his 1,444 career regular-season games are the most ever for a player without a Cup title. Third on that list is his current Stars teammate, 39-year-old Joe Pavelski with 1,332 games, and Parise is fifth with 1,254.\n\nParise has brought a veteran presence to the Colorado lineup since joining the team as a free agent in January. He said this will be his final NHL season.\n\nSCORELESS JOE\n\nPavelski's 73 career playoff goals are the most for a U.S.-born player, but he didn't have a single point while managing only six shots on net in the seven-game series against Vegas.\n\n\"I have zero concern that Joe's fingerprints are going to be on our playoffs before this is said and done, regardless of what the stat lines say,\" said DeBoer, who also coached Pavelski in San Jose. \"They already are in all the other things he does, both in the dressing room and all the little intangibles on the ice.\"\n\n(The Associated Press

They broke down likely Vezina winner Connor Hellebuyck and are doing the same to Jake Oettinger, who was also among the betting favorites to open the season.\n\nColorado can erase giant deficits as bettors saw in the series opener as the Dallas Stars went into the first break up 3-0 before losing 4-3 in extra time. They can also run up the score like as did against Winnipeg. This offense is game-script proof and is paying good plus money to score 4+ goals -- something it's done in each of its six playoff games thus far.\n\nPinnacle, however, has Over 2.5 goals in regulation at -139 which is also getting added to the card.\n\nThis Dallas defense leads me to believe Colorado will be able to do whatever it wants, especially late in games. The Stars are dressing six defenders but Nils Lundkvist is playing four minutes a night.\n\nThat's giving big minutes to five D-men who just came out of a long hard-fought seven-game series against Vegas, had a quick turnaround for Round 2, and are coming off an overtime game with just one day of rest.\n\nThe Avs have skill but they also have great role players who are adding a different dimension to the offense relative to the top line. The Dallas defenders are logging heavy minutes and considering the Avs scored nearly half of their goals on screens in front of the net in the first round, Dallas could struggle to get those big bodies away from Oettinger all series long.\n\nThe play is for three goals after 60 minutes, but Over 3.5 at +130 or better and even the Over 4.5 at +330 is also worth a little attention. Until anyone slows down the Colorado offense, I'm not betting against them.\n\nNobody has slowed down this Colorado offense and it's worth riding until I see otherwise. Nichushkin has scored in every playoff game to date and is still paying great money to find the back of the net tonight.\n\nI'd play his AGS at +145 or better as a solo play until the books correct it. With the Stars giving massive minutes to just five D-men, Heiskanen will continue to see 25 minutes of ice time while trailing, which creates more shooting opportunities for the losing team.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Avalanche have gone Over the total in 49 of their last 79 games (+16.35 units / 18% ROI).

Took us a bit but once we found our legs, I thought we had a great second, great third,\" said MacKinnon, who tied the game at 3-3 in the opening minute of the third period.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's playoff hockey, and there is just no quit,\" said defenseman Cale Makar, who had a goal and two assists. \"If you are going to look at this game I feel like, as a group, we just stuck with it and grinded it out and found a way to win it.\"\n\nColorado had its first three-goal comeback in a playoff game since 1997. Miles Wood scored with a hard charge and a backhander 11:03 into overtime for a 4-3 win Tuesday night.\n\n\"It took us a little while to get to our game tonight,\" Avs coach Jared Bednar said. \"They capitalized on their chances in the first period.\"\n\nDallas had nine shots on goal in the first period, and came just inches short of a fourth goal. But the Stars had just seven more shots the rest of regulation before being denied six times by Alexander Georgiev in overtime before former Dallas player Andrew Cogliano got a puck out of a scrum in the corner and chipped ahead to Wood, who was screaming for the puck.\n\nThe Avalanche, the 2022 Stanley Cup champion, finished their first series in five games over Winnipeg.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stars had to go the distance before eliminating the Vegas Golden Knights, last year's champions. They won 2-1 in Game 7 at home on Sunday night.\n\n\"I knew that there would be some fatigue and a little bit of an emotional letdown coming off Game 7. I was actually surprised at how sharp we were to start, but it did hit us in the middle part of that game,\" Dallas coach Pete DeBoer said. \"And you also knew that they might be a little rusty at the start. But as they got comfortable, they would get better because they've been off for a week. So I think that's probably what you saw.\"\n\nColorado had three comeback wins against the Jets in the first round, but none of those were from more than one-goal deficits.\n\nBut this wasn't the first time this season for the Avalanche to come back from a 3-0 deficit in Dallas. They were down that early in the second period back in November before scoring six unanswered goals in a 6-3 win.\n\nThe Avs were 3-1 in the regular season against Dallas. They came back in all of them, from two goals down in a 5-4 overtime win and giving up the first goal to a 5-1 win in the other.\n\nMacKinnon said it was easy to draw comparisons from those comebacks.\n\n\"I think against Dallas and then all playoffs we've been pretty good from down a few. Tonight was no different,\" he said. \"It didn't feel like they were dominating us. They had a seeing-eye shot. One went off our defensman's stick. ...

He chased a long pass out from teammate Andrew Cogliano, winning a race to the puck against Dallas defenseman Miro Heiskanen, before barreling in on goalie Jake Oettinger and burying the game-winner with a backhand flip.\n\n\"Took it to the house,\" Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said.\n\nWould you believe it if I told you after looking shaky early in Game 1 of this best-of-seven series, Avalanche goalie Alex Georgiev looked like some unstoppable, impenetrable cyborg combination of Patrick Roy and Jacques Plante?\n\n\"Made some great saves,\" Bednar said.\n\nWith a leaky defense in front of him, Georgiev surrendered three scores to the Stars on nine shots during the opening 16 minutes, 56 seconds of the contest, then refused the puck to get by him for hours, making 13 saves in a row to make this improbable comeback seem not only plausible, but almost inevitable.\n\nWould there be any argument if I told you the Avs and Stars reminded us why there are no more committed diehards than puckheads and the NHL playoffs beat all postseason tournaments in North American sports?\n\nThis hockey was as beautiful as it was brutal, with the tight checking making the big scoring chances all the more breathless. It's a series that would look even better in June, with the Stanley Cup on the line. So don't let some crazy New Yorker -- like the Uber driver that picked me up at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport -- yada, yada, yada about how the Rangers are the team to beat.

Featured Local Savings\n\nThe Avs spotted Dallas a 3-0 lead during a first period in which their defense looked disjointed, their discipline to stay out of the penalty box was lacking and Georgiev gave his apologists renewed reasons to fret.\n\nIf not for Colorado defenseman Josh Manson boldly stepping in behind a sprawling Georgiev to save his bacon and stop a shot by Stars winger Jamie Benn in the waning seconds of the opening period, the rout would've been on, with a deficit too large for even a group as resilient as Colorado to seriously think about overcoming.\n\n\"I tell our guys all the time: The only score that matters is the one at the end of the night,\" Bednar said.\n\nIf we have learned anything about these Avs during a course of this season full of big, dramatic comebacks, it's that they die hard.\n\nTic-tac-toe. One-two-three. Colorado scored three unanswered to tie the score early in the third period. Who dug out of the big hole in Big D? The usual heroes. Makar got his team on the board with a long-range blast. Val Nichushkin, the man of many goals and no words. And Nathan MacKinnon, who doesn't need the league's MVP trophy to certify his status as the most unstoppable offensive force on ice.\n\n\"Their big guys delivered and were all over the scoresheet,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said. He believed the fatigue his players felt from eliminating Las Vegas in an intense Game 7 barely 48 hours before taking the ice against Colorado was a significant factor in the Avalanche's comeback.\n\nYes, there's a long ways to go in this series, and the Stars are among the few teams in the league capable of skating with the Avalanche.\n\nBut down 3-0? On the road? In the playoffs? And refusing to blink?\n\n\"It's playoff hockey,\" Makar said. \"There's just no quit.\"\n\nWould you believe it if I told you this is the kind of victory on which a championship is built?", "source":

If the opening salvo is anything to go by, this could be a fascinating, back-and-forth thrill ride, as the Avalanche won a thriller, 4-3 in overtime.\n\nOne of the big questions heading into the first contest was how fresh Dallas would be. They had vanquished the Vegas Golden Knights only 48 hours earlier in a seven-game series, with the deciding bout coming down to the wire. Their energy and determination in the first period made them look as fresh as daisies in the spring. First, Ryan Suter got the party started at 7:26 via a screened shot. Wyatt Johnston, who is really making a name for himself this season, doubled the lead at 10:55, and stalwart Jamie Benn tipped in a third goal on the power play at 16:56.\n\nRelated: Avalanche vs. Stars: 2024 NHL Playoff Preview\n\nBut the Avalanche would not go down so easily. They are arguably one of the last teams one should award power play opportunities to, yet the Stars committed that exact mistake multiple times in the middle frame, with both Valeri Nichushkin and Cale Makar lighting the lamp to trim the score to 3-2. Then, 39 seconds into the third period, who other than Nathan MacKinnon tapped in a juicy rebound into a gaping net to level the terms at 3-3.

Colorado's 4-3 overtime victory certainly doesn't feel as life-threatening as losing the first two games at home to Vegas did, and the Stars survived that, just as they did losing openers to Minnesota and Seattle last season.\n\nSo let's start there. The second-round series is not over. Having said that, there are perhaps no good ways to lose a playoff opener but there are numerous bad ways, and Dallas practically checked them right off the list.\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\nYou don't want to lose at home.

Check.\n\nYou don't want to give the opponent the emotional boost that comes with erasing a three-goal lead and scoring the final four goals. Check.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou don't want to play into overtime when you are already the tired team after playing a seven-game series that just finished Sunday night and you're going to have to deal with Colorado's speed and playmaking and you've only got five defensemen that DeBoer is willing to send into regular battle, anyway.\n\nCheckmate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDallas can certainly still beat the Avalanche, but that was a seriously poor way of delivering the message.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I was surprised how sharp we were at the start,'' DeBoer said. \"And you knew they were going to be a little rusty at first.''\n\nThat's how the Stars carried a 3-0 lead into the second period, and only a stick save by defenseman Josh Manson kept Jamie Benn from making it 4-0 in the final two seconds of the opening period. At the time, that potential goal seemed superfluous. As the game evolved -- and it evolved quickly with two Colorado goals in the first half of the second period -- it was one the Stars badly needed.\n\nThe funny thing is that some of what we think or say about Colorado and its great skill is a bit on the mythical side. Yes, Nathan MacKinnon scored 140 points this year and deserves to win a Hart Trophy now after being a finalist three other times. Sure, Cale Makar is the closest thing the league has seen to Bobby Orr since the days of Bobby Orr and has the stats to prove it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut over an 82-game season, Colorado led the NHL with 304 goals. Dallas scored 298. What kind of a difference are we really talking about here?\n\n\"If you're surprised that the Dallas Stars are a good hockey team, and you watched the regular season or what they did against Vegas in the first round, then you're not informed,'' Colorado coach Jared Bednar said Tuesday. \"When you're down to eight teams, you're impressed with every team and what they do for stretches of a game.\n\n\"We were undisciplined and we did a lot of standing and watching in the first period. But the only score that matters is the one at the end of the night. You've got to play the full 60 and sometimes more.''\n\nThe Stars played about 30-35 Tuesday night. They need more. Where does it come from? This speed skating contests feels like no place for Joe Pavelski, who did get his stick on a puck for an assist, his first point in eight games. A bigger concern is Roope Hintz, who can handle the skating part just fine but where did his skill and playmaking run off to?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has one point -- a Game 4 empty-net goal in Vegas -- after eight playoff games. A year ago he had five goals and eight assists after eight postseason games.\n\n\"We've got some scorers that need to step up,'' DeBoer said. \"We've got a lot of guys in that boat.''\n\nBased on what they achieved in the first round, there's no reason for the Stars not to still have plenty of believers on their bandwagon, too. Winning four out of five in a tight-checking series after going down 0-2 isn't the easiest way to eliminate the defending Stanley Cup champions.\n\nNow they have dug another one-game hole that feels a bit like a trench. Colorado wasn't exactly lacking in confidence after winning the Cup in 2022 with these same skill players and then taking four straight from the Winnipeg Jets after losing a 7-6 opener in the first round. In that series, Colorado never scored fewer than five goals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGive Dallas credit for chopping that down to four Tuesday night. Doesn't feel like that's going to be enough unless the Stars regain their legs quickly and throw a lot more pucks at Alexandar Georgiev, whose five-game winning streak includes a 2.2 goals against average. On a team with Colorado's weapons, frankly, that feels unfair.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreDallas Stars haunted by Colorado ghosts, blow lead vs. Avs just like in the regular seasonFive thoughts from Stars-Avalanche Game 1: Dallas can't contain Colorado stars in OT loss\n\nFind more Stars coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Orr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Orr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Manson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Manson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Benn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Benn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_Memorial_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hart Memorial Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Bednar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Bednar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pavelski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Pavelski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/A6OVIKZUH5CK3J6Y3EUTRJQGL4.jpg?auth=9760c379afa64679e34e07bf47791e1f6a64a799f53ef3e15940cc3f1ab51791&height=467&width=830&smart=true&quality=40", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

I see their Game 7 momentum carrying forward into the first two games of the series at home. The Stars didn't get to show much of their offensive prowess in the series against Vegas, as goaltending and strong defense by the Golden Knights made every score hard to come by. Colorado doesn't have that same strength and has had some issues in net, so expect higher-scoring affairs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, Dallas won't want to get into offensive shootouts each night. If the Stars can win at least one game at home to start the series, they'll be set up for success, but either way, it's tough to see this round ending any way besides another Game 7. We all know what happens when Pete DeBoer is put in that position.

The Avs are loaded with offensive stars, so this has to be a series where Jake Oettinger stands up and outperforms Alexandar Georgiev. He's capable and appears ready for the task.

Colorado scored an average of five goals a game in winning three out of four against the Stars this year. Not sure he's gotten over that yet.

Artturi Lehkonen is tied for 11th with eight points (5g/3a), and Valeri Nichushkin is tied for 15th with seven points (7g/0a).\n\nThe Avalanche joined the ranks of only three other NHL teams to score at least five goals in each of their first five playoff games. The 1985 Blackhawks (seven games) and the 1994 Rangers (six games) are the only teams to surpass this early scoring run.\n\nThe Avs totaled 28 goals in Round 1, the most through the first five games of a playoff run in franchise history.

He extended his scoring streak of finding the back of the net in every First Round matchup. Lehkonen and Nichushkin tied Michel Goulet (1985) for the longest playoff-opening goal streak in franchise history. Martin Havlat (six games in 2006) was the last time an NHLer recorded a longer streak.\n\n13\n\nColorado tallied three third-period goals in Game 5 against Winnipeg and has registered 13 in the playoffs.

We were up 3-0,\u00e2\u20ac the Stars forward said after their 4-3 overtime loss to the Colorado Avalanche in Game 1 of the Western Conference Second Round at American Airlines Center on Tuesday.\n\nYes, that was the Stars\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 lead on the Avalanche after the first period on Tuesday. The Stars came out exactly the way they wanted, perhaps even a little better than expected. They were playing their game and they built a solid lead on their Central Division foes.\n\nThen the second period began, and things started going awry. The Stars took penalties, which the Avalanche turned into power-play goals from forward Valeri Nichushkin and defenseman Cale Makar. The Stars struggled to complete passes. They no longer had traffic in front of Avalanche goaltender Alexandar Georgiev.\n\nThey didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t challenge him with many chances, either.

I think that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s probably what you saw. I was actually surprised how well and how hard we pushed in overtime.

They now face the Avalanche, who by time the puck drops for Game 1 on Tuesday night will have gone a full week since wrapping up their opening round with 28 goals in five games against one of the league's top defensive teams.\n\n\"We're going to have to work ourselves into the series to see how we're going to have to win,\" DeBoer said Monday. \"My initial reaction, just watching what they did to Winnipeg, is I don't think we want to get in a track meet. ... At the same time, we're not going to sit and try to defend in the entire series. I think we've got other layers to our game.\"\n\nDallas can score, too, with a franchise-record eight 20-goal scorers in the regular season and ranking third in the NHL at 3.59 goals per game. The Avs had a league-high 3.68.\n\nWhile the Stars hope to have an advantage going right from one series to another one, the Avalanche are drawing on experience from long layoffs during their 2022 Stanley Cup title run. They had a break of more than a week between the first and second rounds, and another before the final when they knocked off Tampa Bay in six games.\n\n\"We approached this week the same as we did then,\" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"The way you handle every situation it's not just like, you know, willy-nilly, you're trying to think of the best way to do it. You're gathering information from your team on rest, work, how they're feeling, what we can go over, just trying to fine-tune everything so we're ready to go when the puck drops.\"\n\nIn veteran center Nathan MacKinnon's view, the Avs should be ready for one thing: \"Their best, hardest game,\" he said. \"We're prepared to work our butts off and compete. We expect a very, very, very hard series. But we're confident in ourselves. We feel like we have a deep team and we get the job done.\"\n\nValeri Nichushkin had seven goals, the most by the 12 different Colorado players that found the net in the opening round. Nichushkin and Artturi Lehkonen are the first teammates in NHL history with simultaneous five-game goal streaks to open a postseason.\n\nOnly three other teams have opened the playoffs with at least five goals in each of their first five games. The Avs are the first since the 1994 New York Rangers, who then won their last Stanley Cup title.\n\nWinnipeg had allowed an NHL-low 2.41 goals a game in the regular season, while standout goalie Connor Hellebuyck had a 2.39 goals-against average in his 60 games.\n\nStars goalie Jake Oettinger had a 1.95 goals-against average and .925 save percentage against the Knights, and stopped 73 of 74 shots in the third period or overtime.\n\nOettinger allowed more than two goals only once over the last 11 regular-season games. The lone exception was a 7-4 win at Colorado on April 7 -- he allowed 14 goals in three regular-season appearances against the Avs.\n\n\"The third period-overtime numbers show what we already knew here, that he's a rise-to-the-occasion guy,\" DeBoer said. \"He recognizes the big moments, the important times of a series, of a game. And he finds another level for us, regardless of what's happened before.\"\n\nColorado was 3-1 this season against the Stars, with Alexander Georgiev in net for all of them, also allowing 14 goals with an extra game. He had a 3.03 GAA and .893 save percentage in the first round against Winnipeg.\n\nAvalanche forward Zach Parise and Dallas defenseman Ryan Suter are former teammates and good friends who still hope to hoist the Stanley Cup for the first time.\n\nParise and Suter, both 39 years old, were together for nine seasons with the Minnesota Wild from 2012-21.\n\nSuter is in his third season with Dallas, where he signed in free agency after leaving the Wild, and his 1,444 career regular-season games are the most ever for a player without a Cup title. Third on that list is his current Stars teammate, 39-year-old Joe Pavelski with 1,332 games, and Parise is fifth with 1,254.\n\nParise has brought a veteran presence to the Colorado lineup since joining the team as a free agent in January. He said this will be his final NHL season.\n\nPavelski's 73 career playoff goals are the most for a U.S.-born player, but he didn't have a single point while managing only six shots on net in the seven-game series against Vegas.\n\n\"I have zero concern that Joe's fingerprints are going to be on our playoffs before this is said and done, regardless of what the stat lines say,\" said DeBoer, who also coached Pavelski in San Jose. \"They already are in all the other things he does, both in the dressing room and all the little intangibles on the ice.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham

Well, world-class talent travels in the Stanley Cup Playoffs as well, and the Colorado Avalanche has the best five-man unit in the NHL.\n\nCale Makar had a goal and two assists Wednesday night as the Avalanche roared back from a three-goal deficit to take Game 1 against the Dallas Stars in this second-round series at American Airlines Center. Nathan MacKinnon and Valeri Nichushkin had a goal and assist each in the 4-3 overtime victory. Mikko Rantanen had a pair of assists.\n\n\"I think at the end of the night, when you look at the score sheet, their big guys all kind of delivered and are all over the score sheet,\" Stars coach Peter DeBoer said. \"I thought a couple of our guys were, but some of our scoring has to step up.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, DeBoer noted the best way to keep Colorado's top players from dictating terms was to make them spend a lot of time in the defensive zone. Whatever tactics the Stars tried to make that happen in Game 1 did not work.\n\nIt's a similar refrain to the opening-round series against the Winnipeg Jets. Winnipeg was the stingiest team in the Western Conference this season, tied for the fewest goals allowed with the Florida Panthers.\n\nColorado's stars dominated the deep, defensively stout Jets.\n\nDallas is, in some ways, a better version of Winnipeg. The Stars were nearly as adept at the defensive end with more offensive firepower to try and match up with the Avs. They held the defending champion Vegas Golden Knights to 16 goals in seven games, including 12 in the final six.\n\nIn Game 1 of this series, Colorado's stars dominated the deep, defensively-stout Stars.\n\n\"Everything we expected,\" MacKinnon said. \"A low-event game. A tight game. It was definitely tough taking a week off. It took us a bit. But once we found our legs, I thought we had a great second (and a) great third.\"\n\nAfter the Avalanche fell behind 3-0, the club needed a spark. Nichushkin drew a penalty and subsequently scored a power-play goal 13 seconds later.\n\nMakar drew a penalty and rifled one into the net 91 seconds later. In a span of less than four minutes, the Avs were right back in the game. And the power play is now 8-for-18 in six playoff contests.\n\n\"It's been huge,\" MacKinnon said. \"It's our job to produce on the power play. It's so tight out there. Guys are playing so hard defensively. The power play is huge. I'm sure they'll make some adjustments. But we've got to keep finding ways to produce.\"\n\nThe Avs' big guns didn't just tip this tilt on special teams. Colorado's top line, plus Makar and Devon Toews, dominated at even strength.\n\nColorado created 82.99% of the expected goals at 5-on-5 when Makar was on the ice. His xGF% was the \"worst\" of the big five. All three of the top-line forwards were at 88% or better.\n\nWhen MacKinnon was on the ice at the same time at 5-on-5 as Dallas all-world defenseman Miro Heiskanen, the Avalanche had 14 of the 18 shot attempts and 98.71% of the expected goals. When Chris Tanev, the Stars' marquee trade-deadline acquisition was out there against MacKinnon, the Stars fared better.\n\nColorado's expected goal percentage when MacKinnon was on the ice with Tanev was 57.23%, but the Avs' second line also had a great night of possessing the puck and controlling the scoring chances.\n\nOne of the most intriguing storylines with the Stars is DeBoer is basically only playing five defensemen right now. Nils Lundkvist averaged 14:06 per game in the regular season, but he's played 18:16 in the past six games combined, including just 4:07 in an overtime game Tuesday night.\n\nThe Stars are at a rest disadvantage coming into this series, having needed two more games to survive the first round. And now those five defensemen are being tasked with holding up against the best offensive team in the league, both in the regular season and now in the playoffs.\n\n\"We'll see,\" DeBoer said when asked if playing five most of the time needs to change. \"We're playing to win games. We play the guys and the minutes are reflective of the guys we feel can win games. That's what they are, and that's forwards and defensemen.\"", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corey_masisak@denverpost.com", "name": "Corey Masisak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peter DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Lundkvist", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nils Lundkvist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_Toews", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Devon Toews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miro_Heiskanen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miro Heiskanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Tanev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Tanev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/TDP-L-AVALANCHE-STARS_DSC5771.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Joel Kiviranta for Dallas -- now a member of the Colorado Avalanche -- scored the overtime winner to complete his first NHL hat trick.\n\nDallas went on to beat the Vegas Golden Knights in five games, but their run ended in the Cup Final to the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n\nColorado took the season series against Dallas 3-1, scoring 20 goals in four games.\n\nOur first-round series simulation of Dallas versus Vegas was a doozy. The Stars got out to a 3-0 series lead until the Golden Knights came roaring back and won the series in overtime of Game 7.\n\nA similar outcome transpired in our series simulation of Colorado versus Winnipeg. Colorado had a 2-0 series lead before Winnipeg rattled off four wins in a row to take the series.\n\nSo NHL 24 was wrong in predicting the winner of those two series. If you're a Dallas fan maybe you'll be happy with the series simulation here. Colorado easily handled the Stars, defeating them in five games.\n\nThe MVP for the series was a tie between Nathan MacKinnon who had four goals and nine points and Alexander Georgiev who was sensational, only allowing 10 goals in five games and putting up a .945 save percentage.\n\nThe most disappointing player from the series you could argue was a tie as well. Roope Hintz put up a bagel and was a minus-five while playing on Dallas' first line. Jake Oettinger could not replicate his stellar first-round performance against Vegas. He allowed 20 goals in the five games and an abysmal 3.78 goals-against average.\n\nThis second-round matchup has all the makings to go six or seven games and I would put money on NHL 24 being wrong in predicting this series to be this short. Puck drop for Game 1 is Tuesday night at 9:30pm EST.", "source": {"uri": "thehockeynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hockey News on Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Kiviranta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Kiviranta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roope_Hintz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roope Hintz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Railroad_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Railroad Games", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://thehockeynews.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjcxMzE3Nzg2MjQwNzg3/usatsi_21931559.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

They now face the Avalanche, who by time the puck drops for Game 1 on Tuesday night will have gone a full week since wrapping up their opening round with 28 goals in five games against one of the league's top defensive teams.\n\n\"We're going to have to work ourselves into the series to see how we're going to have to win,\" DeBoer said Monday. \"My initial reaction, just watching what they did to Winnipeg, is I don't think we want to get in a track meet. ... At the same time, we're not going to sit and try to defend in the entire series. I think we've got other layers to our game.\"\n\nDallas can score, too, with a franchise-record eight 20-goal scorers in the regular season and ranking third in the NHL at 3.59 goals per game. The Avs had a league-high 3.68.\n\nWhile the Stars hope to have an advantage going right from one series to another one, the Avalanche are drawing on experience from long layoffs during their 2022 Stanley Cup title run. They had a break of more than a week between the first and second rounds, and another before the final when they knocked off Tampa Bay in six games.\n\n\"We approached this week the same as we did then,\" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"The way you handle every situation it's not just like, you know, willy-nilly, you're trying to think of the best way to do it. You're gathering information from your team on rest, work, how they're feeling, what we can go over, just trying to fine-tune everything so we're ready to go when the puck drops.\"\n\nIn veteran center Nathan MacKinnon's view, the Avs should be ready for one thing: \"Their best, hardest game,\" he said. \"We're prepared to work our butts off and compete. We expect a very, very, very hard series. But we're confident in ourselves. We feel like we have a deep team and we get the job done.\"\n\nBIG SCORERS\n\nValeri Nichushkin had seven goals, the most by the 12 different Colorado players that found the net in the opening round. Nichushkin and Artturi Lehkonen are the first teammates in NHL history with simultaneous five-game goal streaks to open a postseason.\n\nOnly three other teams have opened the playoffs with at least five goals in each of their first five games. The Avs are the first since the 1994 New York Rangers, who then won their last Stanley Cup title.\n\nWinnipeg had allowed an NHL-low 2.41 goals a game in the regular season, while standout goalie Connor Hellebuyck had a 2.39 goals-against average in his 60 games.\n\nGOALIES\n\nStars goalie Jake Oettinger had a 1.95 goals-against average and .925 save percentage against the Knights, and stopped 73 of 74 shots in the third period or overtime.\n\nOettinger allowed more than two goals only once over the last 11 regular-season games. The lone exception was a 7-4 win at Colorado on April 7 -- he allowed 14 goals in three regular-season appearances against the Avs.\n\n\"The third period-overtime numbers show what we already knew here, that he's a rise-to-the-occasion guy,\" DeBoer said. \"He recognizes the big moments, the important times of a series, of a game. And he finds another level for us, regardless of what's happened before.\"\n\nColorado was 3-1 this season against the Stars, with Alexander Georgiev in net for all of them, also allowing 14 goals with an extra game. He had a 3.03 GAA and .893 save percentage in the first round against Winnipeg.\n\nSuter is in his third season with Dallas, where he signed in free agency after leaving the Wild, and his 1,444 career regular-season games are the most ever for a player without a Cup title. Third on that list is his current Stars teammate, 39-year-old Joe Pavelski with 1,332 games, and Parise is fifth with 1,254.\n\nParise has brought a veteran presence to the Colorado lineup since joining the team as a free agent in January. He said this will be his final NHL season.\n\nSCORELESS JOE\n\nPavelski's 73 career playoff goals are the most for a U.S.-born player, but he didn't have a single point while managing only six shots on net in the seven-game series against Vegas.\n\n\"I have zero concern that Joe's fingerprints are going to be on our playoffs before this is said and done, regardless of what the stat lines say,\" said DeBoer, who also coached Pavelski in San Jose. \"They already are in all the other things he does, both in the dressing room and all the little intangibles on the ice.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports

He had help from Nathan MacKinnon, Valeri Nichushkin, and Mikko Rantanen, all of whom contributed two points.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the Avalanche fare going into Game 2. Perhaps Jonathan Drouin's update will provide the squad with a spark. Even without Drouin, Avalanche fans have great reason for optimism.\n\nAvalanche look to continue momentum into Game 2\n\nThere are two reasons Colorado fans should be excited for Game 2 and beyond: the play of Valeri Nichushkin and the rise of Nikolai Kovalenko.\n\nNichushkin is on the verge of making NHL history after his standout Game 1 performance against the Stars.\n\n\"Valeri Nichushkin (8-1 -- 9 in 6 GP) was pivotal in Colorado's three-goal comeback win in Game 1 by scoring the first of his team's three straight goals in regulation,\" NHL Public Relations wrote. \"His string of success was established at the start of the 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs and enters Game 2 with the opportunity to join Pat LaFontaine (7 GP in 1992 w/ BUF) as just the second player in NHL history to score in each of his club's first seven games of a postseason.\"\n\nThe 29-year-old will continue to aid the flow of Colorado's offense. If he continues his play, the Avalanche have a great chance of keeping pressure on the Stars. It is not just the immediate series that fans have hope for. One of Colorado's up-and-coming players is showing great promise.\n\nNikolai Kovalenko made his Avalanche debut in the team's 5-1 Game 4 victory over the Jets on April 28th. He showed flashes of offensive skill in the matchup and earned notable praise from Jared Bednar.\n\n\"He plays the right side and is a left shot. He's a competitive guy. That's why we called him up. We feel like he's a good option to be able to step up and help, and he did. I liked his minutes. He didn't play a lot, but he was responsible and took care of the puck. He has a physicality to his game. He's not scared of the moment. He's excited to be here..\" Bednar said, per Colorado Hockey Now.\n\nAs Kovalenko continues to find his role, Colorado will benefit from the depth he provides.\n\nAll in all, things look bright for the Avalanche, but they must stay focused against a fiery Stars team.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christopher_smith@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Christopher Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Drouin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Drouin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Bednar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Bednar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_LaFontaine", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat LaFontaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Sabres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Sabres"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Avalanche-news-Colorado-gets-huge-Jonathan-Drouin-sighting-but-theres-a-catch.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-18", "textStart": 568, "textEnd": 578}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-28", "textStart": 3082, "textEnd": 3092}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

On the other, we should feel lucky that we're getting the matchup at all. It's a conference finals-caliber series; it's just starting a little early.\n\nBoth teams were favored in their first-round matchups, but only the Stars were truly tested. They're the favorites here, as well. Can Colorado's stars help close the gap? Will the series live up to its expectations? We'll start figuring things out on Tuesday night in Dallas.\n\nIf your first instinct is, \"this series feels a lot closer than this,\" we don't blame you. The Avalanche are an elite offensive team that flipped the switch in Round 1, pulverizing a supposedly stout Winnipeg Jets team. They look ready for a deep run.\n\nBut there is a massive obstacle in their way: arguably the league's most complete team. Even the best teams have some flaw in one way or another, whether that's offense or defense, star power or depth, finishing or goaltending. The Stars are the rare team that can check almost every box. They're a two-way powerhouse built to keep up with some of Colorado's biggest strengths and overwhelm its weaknesses.\n\nColorado carries championship pedigree, and that matters more than shown above. That alone might make this series closer to a toss-up. But our best guess is that the Stars ultimately prevail -- this feels like their year.\n\nWith 17 goals between these two teams, this is the most even second-round series by the numbers.\n\nWhen it comes to the Stars, the word that stands out is \"balance.\" Dallas' plus-71 Net Rating is fueled by their play on both ends of the ice. Offensively, this team gets contributions from up and down the lineup -- with eight 20-goal scorers in the regular season and a lot of secondary scoring in Round 1. That depth made for a team that ranked in the top 10 in expected and actual scoring in the regular season. In Round 1, that offensive creation was still there, but was slowed by strong goaltending.\n\nColorado's a deeper team than when the season started, but their approach is a bit more top-heavy than Dallas'. It works for them, though, to the tune of a plus-50 Offensive Rating. That improved by eight goals from the regular season after pouring quality chances on the Jets and beating one of the best goalies in the world 24 times in five games.\n\nThe Avalanche scored at the highest rate at five-on-five in the league in the regular season. Thanks to their speed off the rush, crafty passing and high-end finishing talent, they've maintained that through Round 1.\n\nThat's going to be a test for the Stars' elite defense. They're one of the best teams at slowing opponents in transition and disrupting passes, which landed them second in expected goal suppression this season.\n\nColorado doesn't stack up to Dallas defensively; they're separated by a difference of 35 goals. In Round 1, the Avalanche were able to outscore any gaps in their coverage. That likely won't be as easy to do against the Stars, who are stronger than Winnipeg on both ends of the ice.\n\nWill Colorado's star power be the difference in this series?\n\nThe Avalanche have built a perennial contender upon an elite core. Nathan MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen, Valeri Nichushkin, Cale Makar and Devon Toews are the reason the team is so dominant year after year.\n\nIn most playoff series, those guys are usually the difference, and that was unsurprisingly the case against Winnipeg. The Jets had no answer for Colorado's fearsome five, who earned a combined Net Rating of 7.3 during the series -- 2.4 more goals than expected. Beyond simply being elite players, the fact they further elevate their game when it counts is what always makes the Avalanche a tough out.\n\nThe Stars have their own stars, but a cross-examination of the two teams' top players leaves the Stars wanting in the \"one of the best players in the world\" department.\n\nJason Robertson might be able to keep up with Rantanen as one of the league's best wingers. Roope Hintz's value is on par with Nichushkin's, though with obviously different play-styles. Miro Heiskanen might not be Makar, even in a down year for Makar, but he's always in the conversation for one of the best defensemen in the world. Thomas Harley has blossomed into a legitimate top-pair defenseman worthy of delivering similar value to Toews. Most would probably prefer the Colorado side of that equation, but what the Stars offer is at the very least close enough.\n\nBut then there's MacKinnon -- a player the Stars simply do not have an equal counterpart for. To be fair, there are probably only two other teams that do -- probably only one, if we factor for playoff acumen.\n\nMacKinnon is a rare breed, the type of player that is extremely difficult to come by and that opposing game plans are built to stop. He can win a series on his own, and has shown as much in the past.\n\nDallas is the favorite for a reason, as the Stars have more value across their lineup. The Stars make up for the MacKinnon gap in the aggregate with a sizable depth advantage. That might be the difference. But that still means finding an answer for Colorado's biggest edge.\n\nHaving one player be able to deliver that much value in a single lineup spot is a massive luxury. Colorado has enough depth to make things closer elsewhere, with MacKinnon serving as its ace in the hole. He's a true game-breaker that is extremely difficult to slow down, let alone stop. He rarely fails to at least meet expectations in a series, and his drive to win might be just as scary as his all-world ability.\n\nIf there's one potential saving grace with Dallas' star players, it's that they look like the most well-equipped team to handle Colorado's firepower. Robertson, Hintz, Heiskanen and Harley all carry elite Defensive Ratings that might make things harder than usual for MacKinnon to do his thing. Having an elite shutdown pair in Esa Lindell and Chris Tanev on top of that only furthers things.\n\nThey won't stop him completely, but they might be able to slow him down enough to make Dallas' advantages elsewhere too overwhelming to overcome. Colorado's stars shine bright when it matters most, but they might have a difficult time against a Stars team built to dull their glow.\n\nCan Dallas keep getting away with only playing five defensemen?\n\nStars coach Pete DeBoer deserves all kinds of credit for managing to, essentially, play one defenseman down for the vast majority of the Vegas series. (Ideally, there'd be a non-Nils Lundkvist option somewhere in the organization who's suited for, say, 10 minutes a game, but we digress.)\n\nWhether that can continue is one of the series' most interesting subplots. The results so far have been great; each of Dallas' five regular defensemen has a positive expected goal share. Four of them, though, are averaging more than 23 minutes per game, led by Heiskanen at 27:26. Lundkvist barely played more than that in seven full games. If he had a shot at establishing himself a bit more, it might have gone out the window when he allowed Brett Howden to skate past him and wait for a game-tying tap-in in Game 7. Not ideal.\n\nWhen playing time is that lopsided, it has a trickle-down effect on Net Ratings; Lundkvist's is lower because plays so little, and the rest of Dallas' defense is inflated because they play so much. More importantly for our purposes, the model doesn't account for fatigue. Has DeBoer? Time to find out.\n\nDuring the regular season, it was business as usual for Dallas' top line of Robertson, Hintz and Joe Pavelski. They were largely inseparable (only three forward combos played more together) and highly effective (56.9 percent goal share, 55.6 actual), though a bit less so than in years past.\n\nAgainst Vegas, though, they were mediocre, mustering just 41 percent of the expected goals share and getting outscored 1-0. Only Robertson had a five-on-five point. The fact that the Stars weathered that and won the series is a testament to how the rest of the roster has improved. It also might be a warning to the remaining teams; Dallas continuing to get so little from those guys isn't likely. While it's hard to imagine DeBoer splitting them up on a permanent basis, it's worth noting that he seems more willing to try different combos; Wyatt Johnston played with Robertson and Pavelski in Game 1, and Pavelski played with Johnston and Jamie Benn in Game 7.\n\nSpeaking of Johnston, he's in the middle of a star turn that's a) unsurprising and b) still impressive. In Round 1, Dallas earned almost 69 percent of the expected goals share while outscoring Vegas 5-3 with him on the ice. At five-on-five, he created 33 scoring chances, which leads all skaters. Overall, he has four goals and three assists and raised his Offensive Rating by two points in the first round alone. Logan Stankoven also seemed to be up for the task in his first career playoff series, putting up positive Game Scores in five of seven games and setting up a pair of goals. Benn has added a bit, as well, finishing second in all-situations scoring chances with 21 and bringing plenty of physicality. DeBoer split up that trio for Game 7, but going back to it would make sense; Dallas controlled nearly 65 percent of the expected goal share while they were on the ice.\n\nWhatever happens, the Stars will be left with a third line that'll stack up well against Colorado. Matt Duchene, Tyler Seguin and Mason Marchment put up a 58-percent expected goal share against Vegas, fueled mainly by solid defensive play. Vegas only took 12 shots per 60 with those three on the ice, the best mark from any regular combination of Stars forwards. Strong shot suppression and enough offense to get by -- not a bad mix. Dallas also has one of the league's best all-defense fourth lines, and we saw Radek Faksa score a huge goal in Game 7.\n\nOn defense, Dallas has one of the best top pairs remaining in the playoffs. Heiskanen had himself another top-10 season or thereabouts, and Harley is a more-than-capable running mate. They played immense minutes against Vegas' best players and had a 63-percent expected goal share to show for it. The Tanev-Lindell pairing fared even better, putting an expected goal share of 72 percent and holding Vegas off the scoresheet entirely. Tanev was particularly amazing against the Golden Knights; he played more than 144 minutes, and Dallas outscored Vegas 5-0.\n\nGoalie Jake Oettinger could be a major edge for Dallas. He posted a .925 save percentage against Vegas, and of the 14 goals he allowed, just 10 came in the final six games. He showed a particular knack for locking things down as games progressed and stopped 21 of the 22 shots he faced in Game 7.\n\nIt's tough to imagine the first round going any better for Colorado. Every skater, outside of MacKinnon, outpaced their Net Rating projections -- and in MacKinnon's case, he only fell short of his (very high) number by a fraction of a point. In other words, he was as great as he should've been. He's the best player in this series, and it's not a particularly close race.\n\nNothing was more promising for the Avs than their middle-six glow-up, and that starts with second-line center Casey Mittelstadt. He led Colorado in expected goal share (approximately 61 percent), tied for first with four primary assists, and the Avs outscored Winnipeg 5-3 with him on the ice. It's crucial that he and Nichushkin continue to produce against Dallas. The MacKinnon line probably can't carry the offensive load on their own.\n\nAnother reason Colorado needs big minutes from the second line is because the bottom six, compared to the Stars', is lacking. They deserve some credit for how they played against Winnipeg, though -- the third and fourth lines both won their minutes, and Miles Wood, Zach Parise and Yakov Trenin all scored important goals. Dallas, though, is not Winnipeg.\n\nOn defense, behind the reliable greatness of Makar and Toews, Colorado has been largely average. Against the Jets, Sean Walker did what they acquired him to do -- jolt the offense from the third pair. Josh Manson, sandwiched between Makar and Walker on the right side, did even more; he put up three primary assists against Winnipeg, and Colorado outscored Winnipeg in his minutes 8-6. You'd think Colorado would take that sort of high-event hockey if they continue to stay on the right side of it. It's certainly one way to combat Dallas' offensive depth.\n\nIn net, Alexandar Georgiev was good enough ... after Game 1, when he allowed seven goals on 23 shots and more than five goals more than expected. From there on out, he put up a save percentage of .932 and nearly three goals saved above expected. If he puts up those sorts of numbers against Dallas, the Stars will be in trouble. That's still a big \"if,\" though.\n\nMiro Heiskanen vs. Cale Makar\n\nIt's easy to be enamored with potential playoff matchups, whether it will be MacKinnon versus Robertson or Johnston against Nichushkin in this series. But on the back end, between Makar and Heiskanen, it's a power-versus-power matchup of two elite defensemen.\n\nMakar comes into Round 2 with an impressive two goals and nine points in five games. On the surface, that's as good as it gets after a short opening round. But off the scoresheet, Makar hasn't been as dominant as expected.\n\nColorado outscored Winnipeg 5-4 in Makar's five-on-five minutes, but the Avalanche were only around break-even in expected goals and trailed in scoring chances. It's a similar story to his regular season. His scoring? Impeccable, no notes. But below the surface, his numbers just haven't been as sparkling compared to the high bar his prior seasons have set.\n\nHeiskanen isn't a prolific scorer on the back end, but he played at the level of a true No. 1 throughout the regular season. Unlike Makar, the Stars were outscored 6-4 at five-on-five Round 1 in Heiskanen's minutes. But Dallas was the better team in his minutes, with 53 percent of the expected goals share and a plus-21 scoring chance edge.\n\nSince Tanev was acquired, Heiskanen's workload has been somewhat eased. But he still faced a heavy dose of Jack Eichel against Vegas, so it's safe to say he will be exposed to MacKinnon in Round 2, which means head-to-head minutes with Makar.\n\nThis has all the makings of a classic series, a battle between a star-studded offensive powerhouse and one of the league's most complete teams.\n\nThis series will likely be tightly contested, but the early edge has to go to the Stars -- it's hard not to love a team that checks every box.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They now face the Avalanche, who by time the puck drops for Game 1 on Tuesday night will have gone a full week since wrapping up their opening round with 28 goals in five games against one of the league's top defensive teams.\n\n\"We're going to have to work ourselves into the series to see how we're going to have to win,\" DeBoer said Monday. \"My initial reaction, just watching what they did to Winnipeg, is I don't think we want to get in a track meet. ... At the same time, we're not going to sit and try to defend in the entire series. I think we've got other layers to our game.\"\n\nDallas can score, too, with a franchise-record eight 20-goal scorers in the regular season and ranking third in the NHL at 3.59 goals per game. The Avs had a league-high 3.68.\n\nWhile the Stars hope to have an advantage going right from one series to another one, the Avalanche are drawing on experience from long layoffs during their 2022 Stanley Cup title run. They had a break of more than a week between the first and second rounds, and another before the final when they knocked off Tampa Bay in six games.\n\n\"We approached this week the same as we did then,\" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"The way you handle every situation it's not just like, you know, willy-nilly, you're trying to think of the best way to do it. You're gathering information from your team on rest, work, how they're feeling, what we can go over, just trying to fine-tune everything so we're ready to go when the puck drops.\"\n\nIn veteran center Nathan MacKinnon's view, the Avs should be ready for one thing: \"Their best, hardest game,\" he said. \"We're prepared to work our butts off and compete. We expect a very, very, very hard series. But we're confident in ourselves. We feel like we have a deep team and we get the job done.\"\n\nBIG SCORERS\n\nValeri Nichushkin had seven goals, the most by the 12 different Colorado players that found the net in the opening round. Nichushkin and Artturi Lehkonen are the first teammates in NHL history with simultaneous five-game goal streaks to open a postseason.\n\nOnly three other teams have opened the playoffs with at least five goals in each of their first five games. The Avs are the first since the 1994 New York Rangers, who then won their last Stanley Cup title.\n\nWinnipeg had allowed an NHL-low 2.41 goals a game in the regular season, while standout goalie Connor Hellebuyck had a 2.39 goals-against average in his 60 games.\n\nGOALIES\n\nStars goalie Jake Oettinger had a 1.95 goals-against average and .925 save percentage against the Knights, and stopped 73 of 74 shots in the third period or overtime.\n\nOettinger allowed more than two goals only once over the last 11 regular-season games. The lone exception was a 7-4 win at Colorado on April 7 -- he allowed 14 goals in three regular-season appearances against the Avs.\n\n\"The third period-overtime numbers show what we already knew here, that he's a rise-to-the-occasion guy,\" DeBoer said. \"He recognizes the big moments, the important times of a series, of a game. And he finds another level for us, regardless of what's happened before.\"\n\nColorado was 3-1 this season against the Stars, with Alexander Georgiev in net for all of them, also allowing 14 goals with an extra game. He had a 3.03 GAA and .893 save percentage in the first round against Winnipeg.\n\nVETS SEEKING CUP\n\nAvalanche forward Zach Parise and Dallas defenseman Ryan Suter are former teammates and good friends who still hope to hoist the Stanley Cup for the first time.\n\nParise and Suter, both 39 years old, were together for nine seasons with the Minnesota Wild from 2012-21.\n\nSuter is in his third season with Dallas, where he signed in free agency after leaving the Wild, and his 1,444 career regular-season games are the most ever for a player without a Cup title. Third on that list is his current Stars teammate, 39-year-old Joe Pavelski with 1,332 games, and Parise is fifth with 1,254.\n\nParise has brought a veteran presence to the Colorado lineup since joining the team as a free agent in January. He said this will be his final NHL season.\n\nSCORELESS JOE\n\nPavelski's 73 career playoff goals are the most for a U.S.-born player, but he didn't have a single point while managing only six shots on net in the seven-game series against Vegas.\n\n\"I have zero concern that Joe's fingerprints are going to be on our playoffs before this is said and done, regardless of what the stat lines say,\" said DeBoer, who also coached Pavelski in San Jose. \"They already are in all the other things he does, both in the dressing room and all the little intangibles on the ice.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Pat

He accomplished the feat in a 4-3 Avalanche win over the Dallas Stars in game one of the second round. In the Colorado win at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, Wood scored from forward Andrew Cogliano of Toronto, Ontario, and defenseman Samuel Girard of Roberval, Quebec at 11:03 of the extra period.\n\nLike Vincent Trocheck of the New York Rangers earlier in the evening, Wood scored his first career NHL postseason game-winning goal on Tuesday, and it just so happened to be in overtime. This was Wood's fifth career playoff goal, and third this season. The other two came with the New Jersey Devils in the 2023 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Interestingly, all five of Wood's playoff points have been goals, as he has no playoff assists.\n\nOne of the bigger storylines from game one in Dallas on Tuesday, was the fact the Avalanche came back from a 3-0 deficit. Dallas had first period goals from defenseman Ryan Suter of Madison, Wisconsin, Wyatt Johnston of Toronto, Ontario, and Canadian Olympic gold medalist Jamie Benn of Victoria, British Columbia, but was unable to protect the lead. The Avalanche regrouped with two second period goals on the power-play, and an even-strength goal early in the third period before Wood's overtime winner.\n\nThe Avalanche had four players with a multi-point game. Defenseman Cale Makar of Calgary, Alberta had one goal and two assists for three points. Nathan MacKinnon of Halifax, Nova Scotia and right-winger Valeri Nichushkin of Chelyabinsk, Russia had one goal and one assist for two points each. MacKinnon and Nichushkin both led the Avalanche with four shots on goal each.\n\nWe are seeing quite the playoff for Nichushkin, as he has scored a postseason goal in all six Avalanche games to date.

However, they retaliated by netting two goals during the second period and added another in the third, leading to an overtime 4-3 win.\n\nThis feat is not an isolated incident for the Avalanche. In fact, one key stat perfectly encapsulates their remarkable ability to stage comebacks.\n\nThroughout the regular season and postseason combined, the Avalanche have now accomplished the extraordinary feat of coming back from a 3+ goal deficit a staggering five times. No other team in NHL history has achieved this more than three times in a single season.\n\nThe Colorado Avalanche's comebacks have been nothing short of astonishing. On Nov. 18, they were trailing the Dallas Stars 3-0 but rallied to win 6-3. On Jan. 13, they faced a similar 3-0 deficit against the Toronto Maple Leafs but clawed their way back to a 5-3 victory.\n\nOn March 13, they overcame a 3-0 hole against the Vancouver Canucks, ultimately prevailing 4-3 in overtime. And on March 24, they staged a comeback against the Pittsburgh Penguins, erasing a 4-0 deficit to win 5-4 in overtime.\n\nMacKinnon echoes Colorado Avalanche's historic 3-goal comeback performances\n\nNathan MacKinnon drew comparisons to the team's previous three-goal deficit comebacks following their epic Game 1 victory against the Dallas Stars.\n\nMacKinnon's optimism and belief in his team's ability to overcome adversity were evident in his postgame comments.\n\n\"I think against Dallas and then all playoffs we've been pretty good from down a few. Tonight was no different,\" MacKinnon said.\n\n\"It would have been easy to fold after that first period, but we felt like we were playing better than the score showed. We wanted to see it through, and definitely happy to get the comeback,\" MacKinnon added.\n\nColorado Avalanche head coach, Jared Bednar, acknowledged the team's slow start in Game 1 but praised their ability to capitalize on opportunities as the game progressed:\n\n\"It took us a little while to get to our game tonight. They capitalized on their chances in the first period, and we capitalized on some opportunities in the second and third.\"\n\nCale Makar, Valeri Nichushkin, Nathan MacKinnon and Miles Wood each had a goal for the Colorado Avalanche. Goaltender Alexandar Georgiev also played a crucial role, making 19 saves throughout the game.\n\nThe Game 2 of the best-of-seven playoff series is scheduled to take place in Dallas on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arjun_b@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Arjun B", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Penguins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Penguins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Bednar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Bednar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Developers_and_Publishers/Independent_Developers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Developers and Publishers/Independent Developers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23217717-1715180223.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-18", "textStart": 855, "textEnd": 862}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-13", "textStart": 931, "textEnd": 938}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-13", "textStart": 1053, "textEnd": 1061}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-24", "textStart": 1165, "textEnd": 1173}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

He chipped it through the neutral zone and skated on it. I'm happy the puck crossed the goal line. The best part was celebrating with the teammates. That's what it's all about.\"\n\nOn what goalie Alexandar Georgiev has meant to this team throughout the playoffs...\n\n\"He's been huge for us. In the first series he was great for us. The first period, three goals were let in, but the bounce-back he showed was outstanding. He's a big part of this team.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nColorado forward Nathan MacKinnon\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the comeback win...\n\n\"It took us a bit. But once we found our legs, we had a great second and third. [Georgiev] had some great saves, and [Wood] had a great goal.\"\n\nOn what was the mood going into overtime...\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Good. We definitely stayed positive the whole game. It would've been easy to fold after that first period, but we felt like we played better than what the score showed. We wanted to see it through and definitely happy to get the comeback.\"\n\nColorado defenseman Cale Makar\n\nOn Josh Manson's play and saving a goal in the first period...\n\n\"You never want to give up opportunities where you need guys to make big saves like that, and [Georgiev] came up huge for us quite a few times as well. Manson is playing really well and had a huge defensive play.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn coming back from a 3-0 deficit...\n\n\"It's not an ideal spot when we are playing down from three goals, but it was a closer game at that point than the score indicated. A couple of goals went off of us, and one went off my stick. At the end of the day, it's playoff hockey, and there is just no quit. If you are going to look at this game I feel like, as a group, we just stuck with it and grinded it out and found a way to win it.\"\n\nColorado head coach Jared Bednar\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the ability of coming back from a three-goal deficit...\n\n\"It took just a little while to get to our game tonight. [The Stars] capitalized on their chances in the first period and we capitalized on some opportunities in the second and third. [The Stars] came out again in overtime and put it on us but [Georgiev] made some good saves throughout the course of the game. We limited some scoring chances through the middle portion of the game pretty well, but the chances we gave up were good ones. I didn't like the chances we gave up. There wasn't a bunch of them. I thought it was pretty tight checking for both teams for most of the game. But [the Stars] capitalized on some early and we got the better of them taking care of our chances in the middle portion of the game. It's part of it, the only score that matters is the one at the end of the night. You have to play the full 60 and sometimes it doesn't work.\"\n\nOn the turning point in the game...\n\n\"There were some things we needed to do better, so we addressed that first. We were disorganized in the d-zone arrival on the first goal. We were under and around all over the place, the point is open, and multiple guys are going. [The Stars] executed and shot it through the screen, so that's on us. Good faceoff play and it hits our guy. I think [Georgiev] is making that save, but then it hit a stick and changed direction to go over us, and there's no real chance. They make a play, they have to balance it, make a draw. It was well executed on [the Stars'] part. We got some bounces too. We had some good opportunities. I felt like the game started to come for us a little late in the first, and then in the second period we started doing more of what we'd like to see and simplifying our game a little bit. But [the Stars] were more competitive in the first period and our lack of discipline didn't help. But we rebounded nicely in the second period and started to get ready to go.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this post.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreStars coach Pete DeBoer talks Roope Hintz, Dallas' injuries ahead of Game 2 vs. AvalancheJoe Pavelski responds to Pete DeBoer calling out Dallas Stars' struggling scorers\n\nFind more Stars coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miles Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cogliano", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Cogliano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miro_Heiskanen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miro Heiskanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Manson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Manson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roope_Hintz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roope Hintz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Bednar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Bednar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pavelski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Pavelski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dallas_Morning_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dallas Morning News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/WYZOAO2CLBF2FECYI67AR4QH4A.jpg?auth=b4cd1cade7bc2e1140598b8cf514b4715e3a797656080e891104621c4574540e&height=467&width=830&smart=true&quality=40", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

The lethal goal scorer found the back of the net twice in a 4-3 win in Game 1, totaling three points. Artemi Panari and Vincent Trochek also scored for New York.\n\nWhile the Hurricanes tried to come back with two goals in the third period, the big focal point of the game was the Ranger's success on special teams. Trochek and Zibanejad's goals late in the first period, which saw the Blueshirts score three times, came on the power play. If Carolina wants any chance of picking up a split in Manhattan, they need to keep the game at 5-on-5.\n\n(3) Colorado Avalanche vs. (1) Dallas Stars (Game 1)\n\nThe Stars come into this series on a quick turnaround. Despite still having home-ice advantage, the Central Division champions are just two days removed from taking down the defending Stanley Cup champions, the Vegas Golden Knights, in a tough seven-game series. It marks the fourth time in the last six years that Dallas has advanced to the second round. The team, led by goaltender Jake Oettinger and Jason Robertson, hopes to move on to the conference finals in back-to-back seasons for the first time in almost a quarter-century.\n\nStanding in their way is a hungry and determined Avalanche team that is well-rested. Colorado completely picked apart the second-seeded Winnipeg Jets in the first round, beating them in five games to clinch the team's first playoff series win since they won it all in 2022. While players like Nathan MacKinnon and Valeri Nichushkin played pivotal roles in the series, goaltender Alexandar Georgiev came up big in net for the Avs, and will have to be even better in this series.\n\nThis is the first time the Stars and Avalanche have met in the playoffs since Dallas beat Colorado in the second round in 2020 on its way to the Finals.", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_Zibanejad", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mika Zibanejad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/ILBVX5CRLZFJXAGHZKLKNC3CJA.jpg?auth=71c88070026238c55d254f28b58d7abbba07343508c67d6bbabdd5dc59d5c0c4&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Let some loudmouth New Yorker yada, yada, yada you to death with how the Rangers are the team to beat. The survivor of this showdown between Dallas and Colorado should be declared the favorite to win the championship.\n\nThe Avs spotted Dallas a 3-0 lead during a first period in which their defense looked disjointed, their discipline to stay out of the penalty box was lacking and Georgiev gave his apologists renewed reasons to fret.\n\nIf not for Colorado defenseman Josh Manson boldly stepping in behind a sprawling Georgiev to save his bacon and stop a shot by Stars winger Jamie Benn in the waning seconds of the opening period, the rout would've been on, with a deficit too large for even a group as resilient as Colorado to seriously think about overcoming.\n\nIf we learned anything about these Avs, it's that they die hard. Tic-tac-toe. One-two-three. Colorado scored three unanswered to tie the score early in the third period. Who dug out of the big hole in Big D? The usual heroes. Defenseman Cale Makar got his team on the board with a long-range blast. Val Nichushkin, the man of many goals and no words. And MacKinnon, who doesn't need the league's MVP trophy to certify his status as the most unstoppable offensive force on ice.\n\nYes, there's a long ways to go in this series, and the Stars are among the few teams in the league capable of skating with the Avalanche.\n\nBut down 3-0?

They ended a nearly 60-year drought en route to their series win over the Vegas Golden Knights. Now, head coach Pete DeBoer has to prepare his team for Nathan MacKinnon and the high-flying offense of the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nThe Avalanche flexed their offensive muscle against the Winnipeg Jets in round one. Colorado outscored Winnipeg 28-15 in the opening round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Jets entered the postseason as one of the best defensive teams in the NHL. Dallas, on the other hand, had issues with allowing goals during the regular season.\n\nThe Stars played a tight defensive series against the Golden Knights. However, the Avalanche are another matter. And DeBoer acknowledged that he'd rather avoid an offensive shootout against Colorado in this series.\n\n\"We just want to win, whatever that takes. I think we're going to have to work ourselves into the series to see how we're going to have to win. My initial reaction is, watching what they did to Winnipeg, I don't think we want to get into a track meet,\" the Stars head coach said, via NHL.com.\n\nAn inverse of playing styles\n\nThe Stars and Avalanche acknowledged the difference in each team's playing styles. Colorado will try to outscore you and win with their offense. Dallas, though, plays a smothering defensive game that has come alive in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. However, both teams also acknowledged a desire to play the other team's game.\n\nPete DeBoer showed respect to some of Colorado's best players. Nathan MacKinnon, Cale Makar, and Mikko Rantanen are offensive threats whenever they are on the ice. But the Stars have offensively skilled players as well. And at some point, the Dallas bench boss wants to give those players a chance to shine.\n\n\"I think we're not going to sit and try to defend the entire series,\" DeBoer said, via NHL.com. \"I think we've got other layers to our game. We want to put some pressure on their group defensively too.\"\n\nRest vs. rust\n\nAnother aspect of this series is the \"rest vs. rust\" conversation. The Stars finished a close seven-game series against the defending champions. Meanwhile, the Avalanche have had some time off in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Colorado needed just five games to dispatch the Jets.\n\nColorado certainly could benefit from the extra rest. However, it could also work against them. Pete DeBoer has his team playing a consistent game at this point. Playing games in quick succession may tire them out, sure. But it also allows them to avoid getting rusty.\n\nThe Stars head coach acknowledged that the seven-game series can take its toll. When the effects of that close series made themselves known remains to be seen. But the Dallas bench boss hopes his team can avoid a significant drop in play for as long as they can.\n\n\"Let's hope we can push that off, and let's hope we can help ourselves with that as we move forward here. But the road sure doesn't get any easier when you look at the potential opponents,\" Pete DeBoer said, via NHL.com.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tristin_mckinstry@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Tristin McKinstry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pete-DeBoer-gives-eye-opening-track-meet-take-before-Avalanche-series.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The Colorado Avalanche scored 28 goals in five games against the Winnipeg Jets, and although the Dallas Stars managed just 2.29 goals per game, there was scoring early in that series. Both of these teams can put up points.\n\nThat's creating plenty of avenues for Over bets in the series opener. Generally, scoring is more prevalent early in a series, and goals are harder to come by as it goes on. Colorado had a 13-goal opening game in Round 1 while Dallas also saw its highest-scoring clash in Game 1 vs. Vegas.\n\nWith how well Valeri Nichushkin, Casey Mittelstadt, and Artturi Lehkonen are playing, Colorado has depth as it showed with 17 road goals vs. likely Vezina winner Connor Hellebuyck. Dallas also has the scoring depth to match offense at home.\n\nBoth teams were very profitable in first-period scoring markets in the first round. The Avalanche saw both teams score in the first period in three of their five games vs. the Jets. Meanwhile, the Stars saw both teams to score in the first period in four of their seven games despite a low-scoring series.\n\nI'm not saying bet both teams to score in the first frame tonight, although I like it at +160, but it's a good indicator of what bettors should expect in the beginning of this series.\n\nDallas has loved early scoring in the playoffs as 50% of all its goals have come in the first 20 minutes. The Stars also averaged 2.14 total goals in the first frame in a series that averaged just 4.58 total goals per game. On the other side, the Avs averaged 2.4 total goals in the first frame vs. the Jets.\n\nBoth teams have scoring depth, Nathan Mackinnon is on a mission, each side has elite offensive defensemen, and I still don't trust Alex Georgiev. Goals will be scored in this series, and I expect tonight will be the highest-scoring matchup.\n\nThere won't be many games left in the playoffs where I can hit the Over markets on both teams, but Game 1 is a great spot. The public has already moved the opening total from 6 to 6.5 (-110 a side) as plenty of bettors expect goals tonight. Why not both leading goal scorers in Nichuskin and Wyatt Johnston for a point? Both looked great in Round 1 and if the previous four meetings this year are any indication of what to expect, goals will come as Colorado scored at least four times in all four meetings and no game saw fewer than six total.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Mittelstadt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casey Mittelstadt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Hellebuyck", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Connor Hellebuyck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artturi_Lehkonen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artturi Lehkonen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Dominoes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Dominoes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/cddc6f92-a1cf-40e7-bb0d-df2ec4590c1a.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

He tucked home a backhand deke for his third goal of the playoffs and first career overtime tally at 11:03 of the extra period.\n\nColorado stunned the Stars and their faithful with an impressive comeback despite trailing by three goals after 17 minutes.\n\nThe Avalanche found their legs following the first intermission and roared back. Nichushkin cued up the comeback with his league-leading eighth goal of the playoffs, a rebound marker on a power play at 5:31 of the second period.\n\nNichushkin has scored a goal in all six of Colorado's playoff games this season. He is only the third player in NHL history to start the playoffs with goals in six or more consecutive games, joining Pat LaFontaine (seven games in 1992) and Martin Havlat (six games in 2006).\n\nMakar added Colorado's second man-advantage marker at 9:08 of the middle frame by ripping a top-shelf point shot for his third of the playoffs.\n\nMacKinnon tied the clash 39 seconds into the third period, cashing in a loose puck when Makar's long shot was blocked before it reached the net.\n\nDallas kicked off its three-goal lead with Suter's first goal of the playoffs at 7:26 of the opening frame, a long point shot that found the spot through a maze of players screening the goalie.\n\nJohnston's fifth of the playoffs at 10:55 made it 2-0.

No problem.\n\nMiles Wood completed the Avalanche's Game 1 comeback on Tuesday with an overtime tally, leading his team to a 4-3 victory despite the Stars scoring the first three goals in the opening period.\n\nWood received a pass from Andrew Cogliano at center ice and used a burst of speed to get past Miro Heiskanen. He went in all alone on Jake Oettinger and went to his backhand to beat the goalie.\n\nIt was a miraculous comeback by a team that spent several parts of the regular season figuring out different ways to come back from multi-goal deficits. In one of those instances, the Avs trailed 3-0 to the Dallas Stars on the road before scoring six straight goals to double them up 6-3. Wood scored in that game too.\n\nBut playoff hockey isn't supposed to be the same. The games get tighter, the scoring gets tougher and the physicality ramps up. These are all reasons why Dallas was supposed to have the upper hand -- especially at home.\n\nBut the Avs did exactly what they did against the Winnipeg Jets. They didn't let a three-goal deficit in Game 1 bring them down. They imposed their will, played a tight-checking game and rolled four lines offensively.\n\nDallas had just seven shots on goal in the final 43:04 of regulation. It's quite the recipe for success for Colorado, which has now won its last five games.\n\nAt the top of the lineup, the Stars' top stars had no answer for Colorado's best players. Nathan MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen, Valeri Nichushkin and Cale Makar dominated Dallas at five-on-five. And they were 2-for-2 on the power play in the second period when the comeback began. Makar and Nichushkin both capitalized on the man advantage.\n\nFor Makar, he was the only one in the group with three points. The others all trailed behind with two. Nichushkin, who leads the NHL with eight playoff goals, continued his torrid goal-scoring streak, increasing it to six games.\n\nAnd in goal? Alexandar Georgiev managed to settle in, especially in OT, where he made a handful of big stops when Dallas stormed out of the gate itching to send the fans home with something to celebrate.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest save came in the waning moments of the first period. Trailing 3-0, Dallas forward Jamie Benn waited out Georgiev and tapped the puck into what was an open net. But he was met by the stick of Josh Manson, who stopped the goal before whacking the rebound away out of mid-air just before the buzzer sounded.\n\nNobody knew if the save would mean anything when all was said and done. But when Wood capitalized in OT, it was hard to forget how crucial a play it was from Manson.\n\nJust like the first round, the Avalanche surrendered three goals in the first period. But unlike the first round, they didn't score any. Just like the first round, they scored a handful of goals the rest of the way. But unlike the first round, they didn't let anything else past Georgiev.\n\nThe more things stay the same, the more Colorado manages to overcome an early deficit.", "source": {"uri": "milehighsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mile High Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aarif_deen@milehighsports.com", "name": "Aarif Deen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Wood", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miles Wood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miro_Heiskanen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miro Heiskanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cogliano", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Cogliano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikko_Rantanen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mikko Rantanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Manson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Manson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Benn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Benn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://milehighsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GNCFLq1WgAAZRET.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Scoring goals isn't an issue for this team. This postseason, they've also shown that they can lock it down if they really need to and play in low-event games.\n\nIn over 70 minutes of action during Game One between the Avalanche and Stars, the two teams combined for just 48 shots on goal. During the final 43 minutes of regulation, the Avalanche held Dallas to just seven shots on net.\n\nAt this time of the year, you do whatever it takes, and Jared Bednar believes he has a team that can adjust to whatever the game requires.\n\n\"Yeah, I think you have to be (able to play any way),\" Bednar said on Wednesday. \"Every opponent, every game can be different. Different challenges within the game, things you're doing well that you saw that you need to do well before the game and then something else comes up during the game you have to adjust to and get better at or something that you're having success with that you keep exploiting.\"\n\nColorado has an advantage in any type of game, high scoring or low scoring, because they have the superstars that can make a difference in the blink of an eye. Just take Tuesday as an example. Down 3-0, there was no panic in that locker room because they have the stars to get back into it. They were right to be calm. Valeri Nichushkin, Cale Makar, and Nathan MacKinnon scored in a 16 minute timeframe to tie the game up.\n\nIt all starts in their own end, though. Colorado locked the Stars down and gave them nothing, allowing their superstars to go to work. That's an essential part of winning in the playoffs.\n\n\"Whether it's high-scoring or low-scoring, we're still trying to put an emphasis on defending,\" Josh Manson said. \"Some nights that's going to happen, but we trust in our offense enough to stick in any game. We kind of feel out the way the game is flowing, kind of what the game demands of us. We trust in the guys that we have. We have guys that can create that momentum for us kind of at any point and then ride that wave.\"\n\nThat's what you have to do in the playoffs, and it's where the great teams separate from the good ones.\n\n\"The best teams are teams that can win 1-0 and also be highly dangerous if you need more goals than that, that they're able to generate enough chances to be able to stick in games like last night, even when you go down,\" the Avalanche bench boss said.\n\nGame Two between the Avalanche and Stars takes place tonight at 7:30 PM MST.", "source": {"uri": "coloradohockeynow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Hockey Now"}, "authors": [{"uri": "evan_rawal@coloradohockeynow.com", "name": "Evan Rawal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Bednar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jared Bednar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Manson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Manson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valeri_Nichushkin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valeri Nichushkin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://coloradohockeynow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/IMG_0002-scaled.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Colorado let Dallas own the beginning of this series in their barn, falling behind 2-0 quickly and then 3-0 by the end of the first period. Was Alexandar Georgiev cooked? Was the team too rusty after finishing off the Winnipeg Jets in five games? Was something fundamentally broken? No. The Avalanche stormed back with tenacious defense and forechecking to score two goals in the second, one in the third, and one more to cap off the comeback in overtime.\n\nNow, in Game Two, they'll need a stronger start as Dallas is sure to make adjustments to counter what worked so well for Colorado as Game One went on. Jake Oettinger, like Connor Hellebuyck before him, will be expected to elevate his game in the Stars' net, and their skaters will push hard to play a more competitive game than they showed in periods two and three.\n\nAnd they did show that ability, particularly in the beginning of overtime. Without Georgiev's phenomenal work, the game wouldn't have lasted long enough for Miles Wood to get out on a breakaway and score the OT winner. ThaThat'se key to this game - will Colorado impose their like they did in periods two and three? Or will the Stars keep the momentum they generated in overtime to tie up the series?\n\nColorado Avalanche\n\nEverything changed when they stopped playing stubborn hockey and accepted that they had to dump and chase to beat the Dallas Stars. In the first period, Colorado was just a hair off, as rust from the extra time off between games slowed them down a bit -- but more importantly, they were insistent in trying to carry the puck into the offensive zone to create chances.\n\nDallas' defense wasn't having that, and they kept forcing turnovers at the blue line, leading to chances at the other end. Once the Avs forwards accepted that and dumped pucks in instead, they wore down the Stars' defenders with a heavy forecheck and forced turnovers below the goal line. They drew penalties that led to two powerplay goals in the second period.\n\nThey have to do that again. Joel Kiviranta -- whose offensive game is entirely forechecking -- could return to boost the third line, though Chris Wagner was good in his place. Jonathan Drouin started skating in practice but is not expected back quite yet. There will not be any lineup changes on the backend and in goal.\n\nProjected Lines\n\nValeri Nichushkin (13) - Nathan MacKinnon (29) - Mikko Rantanen (96)\n\nArtturi Lehkonen (62) - Casey Mittelstadt (37) - Zach Parise (9)\n\nMiles Wood (28) - Ross Colton (20) - Chris Wagner (14)* -\n\nAndrew Cogliano (11) - Yakov Trenin (73) - Brandon Duhaime (12)\n\nDevon Toews (7) - Cale Makar (8)\n\nSam Girard (49) - Josh Manson (42)\n\nJack Johnson (3) - Sean Walker (26)\n\n*Note: Joel Kiviranta may take Wagner's roster spot if he's healthy enough to play.\n\nDallas Stars\n\nThey had a chance, and they blew it, but they've been there before -- they lost the first two games at home to Vegas in round one before racking up three straight wins and closing out the series in Game Seven. One comeback loss shouldn't haunt them.\n\nHowever, a lack of depth on defense might ruin them. Nils Lundqvist skated under five minutes in a game that went to overtime, forcing the five other defenders to play over 22 minutes apiece. They are horses who can handle the minutes, but could that have something to do with Miles Wood burning Miro Heiskanen on his overtime breakaway goal? Perhaps.\n\nUp front Dallas was dangerous in the first period, but couldn't get the puck on their sticks enough the rest of the way to make a difference.

While both teams are evenly matched, NHL insider Paul Bissonnette has a particular favorite for this series.\n\nHere's his prediction, as shared on the Spitting' Chiclets podcast:\n\n\"I have Dallas winning the series in seven games.\"\n\nBissonnette didn't hold back in supporting his pick, as he said:\n\n\"Dallas doesn't really allow a lot through the neutral zone. Dallas is going to get their chances. They're going to come at you in waves. They've got those young legs going with Stankoven and Wyatt Johnston along with those cagey vets.\"\n\nThose \"cagey vets,\" namely Joe Pavelski, will play a huge role in this series. Overall, Bissonnette feels this series has the potential to be one of the best this playoff season.\n\nHe concluded his thoughts on the series by stating:\n\n\"We're going to have an iconic second-round matchup.\"\n\nThe other members on the podcast echoed Bissonnette's analysis, also saying the series will go at least six games. Fellow podcaster Ryan Whitney picked Dallas in seven.\n\nThe Stars and Avalanche face off for the sixth time in playoff history. The Stars have won three of their previous five meetings, with their most recent encounter being their 2020 second-round series. The Dallas Stars took that series in seven games.\n\nWyatt Johnston leading the way for the Dallas Stars\n\nWyatt Johnston enters this series with seven points in seven games. His four goals versus the Vegas Golden Knights led the team while Miro Heiskanen leads them with four assists.\n\nAdditionally, Jason Robertson has chipped in five points, with veterans like Tyler Seguin, Evgeny Dadonov and Jamie Benn registering three points each.\n\nDefensively, stalwart Chris Tanev registered 27 blocked shots, helping Dallas keep their goals allowed at 2.29 per game. The Stars will need to stay sharp if they hope to contain Hart Trophy candidate Nathan MacKinnon.\n\nBut the big story for the Dallas Stars is goaltender Jake Oettinger, who's played every minute of the Stars' first-round series. They'll hope to finish off this series early in order to give their number one netminder extra rest.\n\nDallas hopes to build on the momentum from their last meeting, a 7-4 win on Apr. 7. One way or another, Paul Bissonnette is right; this series will be an epic matchup.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nestor_quixtan@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Nestor Quixtan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bissonnette", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Bissonnette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Johnston", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyatt Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pavelski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Pavelski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Robertson_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Robertson (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miro_Heiskanen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miro Heiskanen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evgenii_Dadonov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evgenii Dadonov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Tanev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Tanev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Benn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Benn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_Memorial_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hart Memorial Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Seguin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Seguin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Gamebooks", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Gamebooks", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Railroad_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Railroad Games", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Web", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Web", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23200486-1715114674.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-07", "textStart": 2257, "textEnd": 2263}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Those are just two of several connections between these two franchises, which are meeting for the seventh time in the playoffs.\n\nCogliano might be the most qualified guy to speak about both.\n\n\"Dallas and here are two places that I've been able to play that are just phenomenal organizations, from Joe (Sakic) and (Chris MacFarland) in Denver to Jim (Nill) here,\" Cogliano said prior to Game 1. \"He's a special guy, runs things very well, treats people the right way. Both are great teams and have a lot of similarities with how they are run so that shouldn't be surprising.\"\n\nThe Stars rose up to meet the Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings at the top of the NHL in the late 1990s, and both franchises have returned to prominence in recent years. Dallas stopped Colorado's advance in 2020, before losing in the Stanley Cup Final to the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Avs rebounded and won a title two years ago, something this core group of Stars is still chasing.\n\nDallas reached the Western Conference Final a year ago, but the emergence of Wyatt Johnston, Logan Stankoven and Thomas Harley and the arrival of Chris Tanev in a trade have cemented the Stars as one of the league's premier teams.\n\nIt wouldn't be that surprising if these two clubs find each other again in the playoffs in the near future, and a rivalry similar to the one a quarter-century ago develops.\n\n\"If we keep doing what we're supposed to do and get into the playoffs, and they keep doing the same thing, then you're going to face each other a lot,\" Avs coach Jared Bednar said. \"It's just the way it is with the current playoff format. They're obviously a very good team and we like to consider ourselves that. So, yep, I would assume that you're probably going to run into each other every once in a while.\"\n\nCogliano and Kiviranta being recent members of the Stars organization and the significant playoff history is where the connections begin in this series. Valeri Nichushkin was drafted by Dallas in 2013 and bought out by the Stars before joining the Avalanche in 2019.\n\nThis is the second time Matt Duchene has played against the Avalanche in a playoff series since being traded to Ottawa in 2017, although the first time two years ago with Nashville was a fait accompli for Colorado. He'll certainly hear some full-throated boos from the Ball Arena crowd in Games 3 and 4.\n\nThis series could have featured Duchene against Ryan Johansen, former Nashville teammates who both moved to new Central Division clubs in the offseason. Instead, it could feature Duchene taking shifts against Casey Mittelstadt, who is part of the Duchene trade tree. The Avalanche traded Bo Byram, one of the key pieces of the return along with Samuel Girard, for Mittelstadt in March.\n\nIt will also feature a pair of old friends who shook the foundation of the NHL a dozen years ago. Zach Parise and Ryan Suter left their previous teams to sign massive long-term contracts with the Minnesota Wild on July 4, 2012.\n\nBoth players were bought out of those deals three years ago, and Suter will line up against Parise as part of the deep, talented Stars defense corps.\n\n\"We've played against each other a handful of times since we were teammates,\" Parise said. \"We caught up after a game earlier this year. It won't be any different. I think you become friends with a lot of guys on different teams throughout your career and nothing really changes.\"\n\nThe Avalanche and the Stars, fighting for supremacy in the Central Division with an eye towards climbing to the top of the NHL mountain, is also something that might not change for the next several seasons.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Finding a way to limit the Hart Trophy finalist will be key to success in the series.\n\nSports Roundup\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nMacKinnon tied for a team-high nine points (two goals, seven assists) in just five games in the first-round series with Winnipeg. In the regular season, he finished second in the NHL with 150 points (51 goals and 89 assists), setting a franchise record. In the four games against Dallas, he had three goals and four assists.\n\n\"He's a great player that's had a fantastic season,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said Tuesday. \"I feel like I've coached Colorado in the playoffs every year between San Jose, Vegas and Dallas. We've seen an awful lot of him, and he just keeps getting better and better. He just imposes himself on the game every time he's on the ice. He wants the puck on his stick and wants to take control of the game.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeBoer compared Colorado to Vegas in that both teams generate much of their success off the rush. He also compared MacKinnon to Vegas' Jack Eichel, whom Dallas had the most trouble with in the first round, as he recorded seven points in the series (three goals and four assists).\n\nDallas limited Vegas' rush enough to secure the first-round series in seven games and will need to keep that as a point of emphasis in Round 2. However, like Eichel, MacKinnon is someone who will get his points. The Stars just need to limit that number as much as possible.\n\n\"The best thing we can do is try to keep the puck out of his hands and defend with numbers,\" DeBoer said. \"If we're playing in the offensive zone, then he's obviously not attacking. That would be the best defense for us.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMacKinnon is just the beginning of the challenge that Colorado poses. Cale Makar, Mikko Rantanen, Valeri Nichushkin and Devon Toews are other names that Stars defenseman Chris Tanev pointed to as players they need to limit this series. Doing so will require a team effort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's not one guy,\" Tanev said. \"It's five guys that are going to have to work together to shut these guys down because they're that good and that skilled. We're just trying to limit their chances as much as possible.\"\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreHow to watch Mavericks, Stars and Rangers games during busy week on D-FW sports calendarMatt Duchene on

As with every game, you take the good with the bad, so time to take a look at the pluses and the minuses in Game One against the Dallas Stars for the Colorado Avalanche.\n\n- Slow Start\n\nAs many expected, the Avalanche came out and did look like a team that hadn't played in a week. It wasn't all bad, as they did create some scoring chances, with Cale Makar hitting the post on a nice rush, but when you're rusty, the details in your game just aren't there. Colorado got lost in their own end on the first goal, and then found themselves in penalty trouble as the period went on. You do have to wonder if this would have come back to bite them a bit more against a team that wasn't just running on fumes the final 50 minutes, but they managed to survive.\n\n+ Josh Manson's Save.\n\nAll the credit can't go to Josh Manson on this one. Alexandar Georgiev does a great job of staying with Jame Benn and forcing him into a tough angle. I'm still not even sure that puck is going in, but you don't want a puck sliding along the goal line either way. Manson was there to save the day, clear the puck, and the Avalanche were able to get into the intermission without more damage being done.\n\n+ Sean Walker\n\nI loved everything about Walker's game. He was skating, joining the rush, and even showed off some physicality. I don't remember who it was, but he plastered someone with a reverse hit at the blueline. We haven't really seen that part of his game come up much. He finished the night with the lowest expected goals against on the team and wasn't on for a whole lot of dangerous chances towards Georgiev (outside of the one you're about to see).\n\n+ Overtime Georgie\n\nWe've probably spoken about this before, but being a goaltender and not being in any sort of rhythm has to be difficult. Over the final two periods of play, the Stars registered just seven shots on goal. It can be tough to keep your head in the game when something like that happens, but Georgiev came out in the extra period ready to go.\n\nJust after this save, he was forced to stop Wyatt Johnston, who snuck away from everyone and was all alone in front of the net. He didn't have to make a ton of big saves (I do remember a nice glove stop in the third), but when he was needed, he was there for them late.\n\n- Rantanen's Undisciplined Play\n\nI still really haven't seen a replay of the second penalty, and the press box is on the moon, so it was hard to get a clear idea of what happened, but Mikko Rantanen didn't seem terribly happy with that one. The first one seemed pretty obvious to me. Dadonov did a good job of selling it when he felt the pressure of Rantanen coming, but they'll call that one 95% of the time. There was a moment in the second where I thought the refs were going to give Rantanen a third, but he managed to stay out of the box that time. When he gets frustrated, things can start to come unraveled. Offensively, he created a fair bit, which we'll get to, but when I get worried is when he starts yelling at the refs. That's when he has a tendency to take it a bit too far.\n\nScoring chances were 11-3 in favor of the Avalanche with the top line on the ice, and it looked that way. After the game, Pete Deboer seemed incredibly frustrated that Colorado was able to get offense out of their big guns, while the Stars couldn't get enough from their guys.\n\nThat's just what can separate this team from the opposition. They have the big guns that can turn the tide in their favor, and most other teams can't match that. It's the ultimate trump card for Colorado, and while the Stars have some good players, they aren't at the caliber of a Nathan MacKinnon or Cale Makar. Here's Deboer kind of calling out his stars...\n\n\"We had some opportunities in overtime, but at the end of the night when you look at the score sheet, their big guys delivered and are all over the score sheet,\" Deboer said. \"A couple of our guys were, but some of our scoring has to step up. We've been waiting for a series plus a game for some of that.\"\n\n- The In-Arena Show\n\nI loved the whiteout. It's basic and pretty straightforward, but I loved it. However, the thing I loved about it is that it wasn't all showy. There weren't lasers, there wasn't some big show on the Jumbotron. Nope, it was just fans wearing white and going insane.\n\nThe Stars in-arena show was confusing and almost seizure inducing. I've never seen so much green in my life. The intro was like a cheap sci-fi show with some fake superhero, and the payoff was a bunch of aliens? They're calling it Plaioffs2024, with the different spelling referring to AI. At times, they would cut to people in the crowd and turn them into aliens. They're named the Stars, which are obviously in outer space, but the alien part of it all was not really explained a whole lot.\n\n2-for-2. Can't do any better than that. The Stars gave the Avalanche a chance to get back into the game, and Colorado took advantage of it. That's what good teams do. If the Avalanche don't connect on those powerplays, we might be talking about a very different game this morning.\n\nRight now, the powerplay is humming along at 44.4%, and no one can move Valeri Nichushkin from the front of the net. Until another team can figure out how to slow them down, the Avalanche are going to be very dangerous.\n\n+ OT Winner\n\nIt's not usually the guys you expect it to be to win the game in overtime, and this goal is what makes Colorado so dangerous this year. They're getting scoring from everyone, and the hero on Tuesday was Miles Wood.

The Rangers won 4-3.\n\nThe Dallas Stars are in an all-too familiar hole.\n\nThis is their sixth consecutive playoff series over three postseasons, the fourth at home, that they go into Game 2 after losing the opener.\n\n\"It's not ideal, we know that. And it's definitely not the plan,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said Wednesday.\n\n\"You're kind of playing with fire when you put yourself in that position enough,\" forward Joe Pavelski said.\n\nWhen they play Game 2 of their second-round Western Conference series against Colorado on Thursday night (9:30 p.m. ET/TNT), the Stars will try to avoid a repeat of the opening round. Two weeks ago, they lost the first two games at home to Vegas, last year's Stanley Cup champion, though they did fight back to win in seven games.\n\nIn the only other NHL playoff game Thursday, the Carolina Hurricanes go home in their own 0-2 hole to the Rangers. New York has won all six of its games this postseason after a 4-3 double-overtime victory Tuesday night.\n\nDallas twice last year lost Game 1 at home, but won the second one each series on way to rebounding to advance: in six games against Minnesota, and seven over Seattle.\n\nThe 2022 Cup champion Avalanche have won five games in a row since opening these playoffs with a wild 7-6 loss at Winnipeg. Colorado won 4-3 in overtime at Dallas, after a full week between games and then trailing 3-0 in the first period.\n\n\"I definitely feel better when I'm in a rhythm,\" said Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon, who scored the game-tying goal in the first minute of the third period. \"I don't love taking time off. But I think we'll feel better as we play (Games) 2-3-4.\"\n\nColorado has four players that have tallied points in every game this postseason: league MVP finalist MacKinnon, defenseman Cale Makar, former Stars first-round draft pick Valeri Nichushkin and Mikko Rantannen. All have multiple goals.\n\nThe Stars are still waiting for some of their big scorers to get going this postseason.\n\nPavelski, whose 73 career playoff goals are the most ever for a U.S.-born player and the most among active players, still doesn't have one this postseason and just got his first assist in Game 1 against the Avs. Matt Duchene has only one goal, and the lone score for Roope Hintz without any assists was an empty-net goal against Vegas. Rookie Logan Stankoven had six goals his first 12 games after his NHL debut in late February, but hasn't found the net since -- the last 12 regular-season games and eight playoff games.\n\n\"The strength of our team all year has been if Roope Hintz's line doesn't score, then Matt Duchene's line scores. If Matt Duchene's line doesn't score, then Wyatt Johnston's line scores. If none of those guys score, our fourth line scores,\" DeBoer said. \"Our depth has to show up in this series.\"\n\nRANGERS at HURRICANES, New York leads 2-0, 7 p.m. ET (TNT)\n\nThe special-teams battle has been a rout so far. Carolina must find a way to close that gap.\n\nThe teams ranked in the top three in the regular season on both the power play and the penalty kill, including Carolina leading the league on the kill (86.4%). Yet the Presidents' Trophy-winning Rangers have two goals on the power play in each of the first two games while the Hurricanes are 0 for 10, going 0 for 5 in both games.\n\n\"At this time of year, special teams can win a series, win games,\" Rangers defenseman Adam Fox said after Tuesday's double-overtime win decided on - what else? - a power-play goal.\n\nAs Carolina forward Martin Necas said Wednesday: \"Everybody knows it's about the power plays and PKs. So far, they crushed us in those.\"\n\nCarolina has managed a total of 10 shots on goal on the power play so far.\n\n\"We've got to get a little more at the net, a little more inside,\" coach Rod Brind'Amour said. \"They're keeping us to the outside a little too much and we're settling for that.\"\n\nThe Hurricanes have plenty of stats that have gone in their favor, posting a 20-shot advantage (82-62) and a 188-142 edge in shot attempts. Carolina has also outscored the Rangers in 5-on-5 play (5-4) and even strength (6-4), while also doubling the Rangers in shots on goal (30-15) in the third period.\n\nCarolina has also won 53.1% of faceoffs through the two games, reversing road troubles from the first-round series against the New York Islanders (35%).\n\n\"Obviously it's frustrating because you don't feel like you deserve to lose two in a row there,\" Necas said. \"Special teams decided both of the games and they were better at those.\"\n\nAP Sports Writer Aaron Beard contributed to this report.\n\nAP NHL playoffs:

While it was easier for some and tougher for others, the two best teams in the Central Division and arguably the Western Conference meet in the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nGame One is tonight in Dallas with the home team looking to build off their gauntlet run against the Vegas Golden Knights. Meanwhile, the Avs will look to be the disturber and spoil it for the home fans in attendance. Nonetheless, this will be a showdown against two mighty teams kicking off Tuesday night.\n\nColorado Avalanche\n\nColorado has had a full week off after winning Game Five against the Winnipeg Jets 6-3 last Tuesday in Manitoba. Led by Mikko Rantanen's two goals in the third period, he tied Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar for points in the first round, all with nine.\n\nValeri Nichushkin will also face his former team once again in the postseason, tied as the joint-top scorer in the playoffs with seven goals. His impact was missed dearly last season against the Seattle Kraken, and it showed in the first round this season. He will need to be up to the same caliber in the second round.\n\nAvs-killer Joel Kiviranta was a member of the Stars the last time these two faced off in the postseason and will be looking to serve revenge against his former team. He will have to wait though, as he was still skating with a non-contact jersey at morning skate. Chris Wagner left morning skate early, meaning he will likely slot in his place with Nikolai Kovalenko coming out as well. Can the Avs continue their excellent run of form and start the series off on a strong foot?\n\nProjected Lines\n\nValeri Nichushkin (13) - Nathan MacKinnon (29) - Mikko Rantanen (96)\n\nArtturi Lehkonen (62) - Casey Mittelstadt (37) - Zach Parise (9)\n\nMiles Wood (28) - Ross Colton (20) - Brandon Duhaime (12)\n\nAndrew Cogliano (11) - Chris Wagner (14) - Yakov Trenin (73)\n\nDallas has been playing consistently as of late, going all seven games against the Vegas Golden Knights. They just managed to eke ahead of the defending Stanley Cup Champions with a 2-1 win on Sunday night to set this matchup against the Avs.\n\nHaving been playing consistently and not getting any breaks, this perhaps helps the Stars. Colorado is not the best when they have long stretches of time off, and Dallas can take advantage of that. Plus, we still have not seen the best of the best from them so far this postseason.\n\nWhile Wyatt Johnston has been on a tear and someone fans should watch, the likes of Jamie Benn, Joe Pavelski, and Matt Duchene have still not reached their potential in the playoffs. All three seem to love playing against the Avs, and will they bring a scoring touch to help the home team start with a series lead?\n\nProjected Lines\n\nJason Robertson (21) - Roope Hintz (24) - Logan Stankoven (11)\n\nJamie Benn (14) - Wyatt Johnston (53) - Joe Pavelski (16)\n\nEvgenii Dadonov (63) - Matt Duchene (95) - Tyler Seguin (91)\n\nRadek Faksa (12) - Sam Steel (18) - Craig Smith (15)\n\nNo surprises here, as we'll see each team's top goaltender: Alexandar Georgiev for Colorado, and Jake Oettinger for Dallas.", "source": {"uri": "milehighhockey.com", "dataType": "news",

Avs look to put them down 0-2 again", "body": "This is their sixth consecutive playoff series over three postseasons, the fourth at home, that they go into Game 2 after losing the opener.\n\n\"It's not ideal, we know that. And it's definitely not the plan,\" Stars coach Pete DeBoer said Wednesday.\n\n\"You're kind of playing with fire when you put yourself in that position enough,\" forward Joe Pavelski said.\n\nWhen they play Game 2 of their second-round Western Conference series against Colorado on Thursday night (9:30 p.m. ET/TNT), the Stars will try to avoid a repeat of the opening round. Two weeks ago, they lost the first two games at home to Vegas, last year's Stanley Cup champion, though they did fight back to win in seven games.\n\nIn the only other NHL playoff game Thursday, the Carolina Hurricanes go home in their own 0-2 hole to the Rangers. New York has won all six of its games this postseason after a 4-3 double-overtime victory Tuesday night.\n\nDallas twice last year lost Game 1 at home, but won the second one each series on way to rebounding to advance: in six games against Minnesota, and seven over Seattle.\n\nThe 2022 Cup champion Avalanche have won five games in a row since opening these playoffs with a wild 7-6 loss at Winnipeg. Colorado won 4-3 in overtime at Dallas, after a full week between games and then trailing 3-0 in the first period.\n\n\"I definitely feel better when I'm in a rhythm,\" said Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon, who scored the game-tying goal in the first minute of the third period. \"I don't love taking time off. But I think we'll feel better as we play (Games) 2-3-4.\"\n\nColorado has four players that have tallied points in every game this postseason: league MVP finalist MacKinnon, defenseman Cale Makar, former Stars first-round draft pick Valeri Nichushkin and Mikko Rantannen. All have multiple goals.\n\nThe Stars are still waiting for some of their big scorers to get going this postseason.\n\nPavelski, whose 73 career playoff goals are the most ever for a U.S.-born player and the most among active players, still doesn't have one this postseason and just got his first assist in Game 1 against the Avs. Matt Duchene has only one goal, and the lone score for Roope Hintz without any assists was an empty-net goal against Vegas. Rookie Logan Stankoven had six goals his first 12 games after his NHL debut in late February, but hasn't found the net since -- the last 12 regular-season games and eight playoff games.\n\n\"The strength of our team all year has been if Roope Hintz's line doesn't score, then Matt Duchene's line scores. If Matt Duchene's line doesn't score, then Wyatt Johnston's line scores. If none of those guys score, our fourth line scores,\" DeBoer said. \"Our depth has to show up in this series.\"\n\nRANGERS at HURRICANES, New York leads 2-0, 7 p.m. ET (TNT)\n\nThe special-teams battle has been a rout so far. Carolina must find a way to close that gap.\n\nThe teams ranked in the top three in the regular season on both the power play and the penalty kill, including Carolina leading the league on the kill (86.4%). Yet the Presidents' Trophy-winning Rangers have two goals on the power play in each of the first two games while the Hurricanes are 0 for 10, going 0 for 5 in both games.\n\n\"At this time of year, special teams can win a series, win games,\" Rangers defenseman Adam Fox said after Tuesday's double-overtime win decided on - what else? - a power-play goal.\n\nAs Carolina forward Martin Necas said Wednesday: \"Everybody knows it's about the power plays and PKs. So far, they crushed us in those.\"\n\nCarolina has managed a total of 10 shots on goal on the power play so far.\n\n\"We've got to get a little more at the net, a little more inside,\" coach Rod Brind'Amour said. \"They're keeping us to the outside a little too much and we're settling for that.\"\n\nThe Hurricanes have plenty of stats that have gone in their favor, posting a 20-shot advantage (82-62) and a 188-142 edge in shot attempts. Carolina has also outscored the Rangers in 5-on-5 play (5-4) and even strength (6-4), while also doubling the Rangers in shots on goal (30-15) in the third period.\n\nCarolina has also won 53.1% of faceoffs through the two games, reversing road troubles from the first-round series against the New York Islanders (35%).\n\n\"Obviously it's frustrating because you don't feel like you deserve to lose two in a row there,\" Necas said. \"Special teams decided both of the games and they were better at those.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Aaron Beard contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

In Game 1 of the series Tuesday night, Colorado got off to a sluggish start but rallied to win 4-3 in overtime to draw first blood and steal home-ice advantage away from the Stars. Will the Avalanche earn a 2-0 series lead or can the Stars regroup from their meltdown to even things up before the series heads to the Mile-High City?\n\nIn the postseason, Dallas has won three of the five previous series, though the Avalanche own an 18-14 advantage in head-to-head playoff victories.

The first period, three goals were let in, but the bounce-back he showed was outstanding. He's a big part of this team.\"\n\nThere's plenty of hockey left in this series alone before we start talking about Georgiev as the ultimate difference-maker.\n\nBut before the puck drops for Game 2 Thursday plenty will be said about the Avalanche goalie, who managed to go 38-18-5 this season despite sporting a 3.00 GAA and .897 save percentage.\n\nFinishing second-overall this year as one of the league's deepest and stingiest clubs, the Stars had previously won 12 straight games while leading after two periods, and 21 of their last 22.\n\nBut not this one, reminding everyone what the Winnipeg Jets learned in the first round -- count out these Avs at any point at your peril.\n\n\"It was three quick ones, we felt like it wasn't a 3-0 game,\" MacKinnon told reporters.\n\n\"We stayed positive after the first. No negativity.\n\n\"We didn't know if we could come back, we just wanted to see and give ourselves a chance, and we did. Feels great.\"\n\nAccording to Optastats, Tuesday marked the fifth time this season the Avalanche were down by three or more goals and being shut out before shutting down their opposition the rest of the way and completing the comeback for the win.\n\nNo other team has done that more than three times in an NHL season.\n\n\"It was definitely tough taking a week off, took us a bit, but once we found our legs I thought we had a great second and great third,\" said MacKinnon, whose club had won three of the four meetings between these two Central division juggernauts in the regular season.\n\n\"They were buzzing in OT, Georgie made some great saves and Woody had a great goal.\"\n\nSome will suggest the rigors of the Stars seven-game war against Vegas had something to do with the Avs' ability to claw back.\n\nBut it was Georgiev, and his 19 saves, who played an even bigger role.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnet.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnet"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But here we are: Game 1 of Stars-Avalanche goes Tuesday.A tight turnaround complicates a series handicap, like the Bruins-Panthers matchup. In this case, one side might've been a bigger favorite if Dallas wasn't a sports and entertainment hotbed and all things were closer to equal.Let's continue to use the tools we've sharpened leading up to the postseason (even-strength play, skating talent, goaltending) to break it all down.Advanced metrics glossary ES = Even strength xG% = Expected goals share HDCA/G = High-danger chances allowed per game GSAx/60 = Goals saved above expected per 60 minutes SNIPES = HDC goals + PP goals / HDC + PP chances Avalanche vs. Stars TEAM GAME 1 SERIES SERIES HANDICAP Avalanche +115 +105 +1.5 (-200) Stars -135 -125 -1.5 (+160) Tale of the tapeConverting scoring changes at a high rate and having above-average goaltending are crucial ingredients to playoff success. Let's look at predictive metrics for those two elements.Skaters' scoring talent TEAM SNIPES ES xG% HDCA/G Avalanche 14.0% 51.9 9.2 Stars 16.3% 55.6 8.3 The above table spells out why the Stars may be an attractive bet relative to the market. They drove play well (xG%), converted chances better than any playoff-caliber team, and limited opponents' high-danger chances in the regular season. Against Vegas, Dallas overcame a pair of hot goaltenders, as Adin Hill and Logan Thompson (combined 10.46 GSAx) held the Stars to a 9.2% SNIPES rate. Connor Hellebuyck didn't do the same against Colorado (22.7% SNIPES).Goaltending matchup TEAM GOALTENDER GSAx/60 (POST-ASB) PLAYOFF GSAx/60 Avalanche Alexandar Georgiev -0.06 -0.19 Stars Jake Oettinger 0.12 0.32 As expected, Alexandar Georgiev was a replacement-level goalie in Round 1. But there's a twist: Georgiev allowed 4.4 goals saved above expected in Game 1, meaning the following four contests were good enough to get him back near league average. Jake Oettinger's path was similar, going from minus-2.2 GSAx after a brutal Game 1 to plus-2.33 for the series.Team ratingsOddsmakers create moneylines based on a numerical valuation of every team. Here's the market's most recent valuation compared to how I have them rated (based on the metrics above) for the full season and post-All-Star break: TEAM MARKET SEASON POST-ASB Avalanche +20% +9.1% +3.0% Stars +20% +30.1% +16.1% The betting market loved both teams equally throughout the season, which explains why the betting line's so tight - essentially accounting for less than the home-ice advantage. However, the Stars' quality shines through when you trim it down to the skaters' metrics mentioned above, which we consider most valuable.With five more expected goals and 30 more high-danger chances at even strength, the Stars were 18% better than the defending Stanley Cup champions, a Vegas team rated 15% above average in the market. By comparison, the Avalanche were 14% better than the Jets (rated 10% above average). The difference between Colorado's five-game series and Dallas' seven-game series was goaltending.Best betHere are the prices that would be considered valuable for each team on the road, at home, and to win the series. TEAM SERIES WIN PROB. GM 1/2/5/7 GM 3/4/6 SERIES Avalanche 26.7% +214 +157 +313 Stars 73.3% -171 -128 -261 Now for the caveat: the rest issue. The numbers above don't acknowledge Dallas' tight turnaround or Colorado's time off and fewer early playoff miles accrued. There's no formula to account for those variables.For Dallas, it's a similar situation to Round 1 since Vegas came into the playoffs with a full roster for the first time all season. All signs pointed to the Stars winning, but quantifying it was impossible since there was no way to know if Vegas' personnel would take it to another level.Last year, Dallas played two long series against inferior teams before running out of gas while attempting to come back from a 3-0 deficit in the Western Conference Final. Treading lightly is the prudent strategy, but the Stars' quality - they rated as the best road team in the NHL this season - warrants a bet at a short price.Best bet: Stars to win series (-125)(Stats sources: Natural Stat Trick, Evolving-Hockey)Matt Russell is the lead betting analyst for theScore.

Two weeks ago, they lost the first two games at home to Vegas, last year's Stanley Cup champion, though they did fight back to win in seven games.\n\nIn the only other NHL playoff game Thursday, the Carolina Hurricanes go home in their own 0-2 hole to the Rangers.

All have multiple goals.\n\nThe Stars are still waiting for some of their big scorers to get going this postseason.\n\nPavelski, whose 73 career playoff goals are the most ever for a U.S.-born player and the most among active players, still doesn't have one this postseason and just got his first assist in Game 1 against the Avs. Matt Duchene has only one goal, and the lone score for Roope Hintz without any assists was an empty-net goal against Vegas. Rookie Logan Stankoven had six goals his first 12 games after his NHL debut in late February, but hasn't found the net since -- the last 12 regular-season games and eight playoff games.\n\n\"The strength of our team all year has been if Roope Hintz's line doesn't score, then Matt Duchene's line scores. If Matt Duchene's line doesn't score, then Wyatt Johnston's line scores. If none of those guys score, our fourth line scores,\" DeBoer said. \"Our depth has to show up in this series.\"\n\nRANGERS at HURRICANES, New York leads 2-0, 7 p.m. ET (TNT)\n\nThe special-teams battle has been a rout so far. Carolina must find a way to close that gap.\n\nThe teams ranked in the top three in the regular season on both the power play and the penalty kill, including Carolina leading the league on the kill (86.4%). Yet the Presidents' Trophy-winning Rangers have two goals on the power play in each of the first two games while the Hurricanes are 0 for 10, going 0 for 5 in both games.\n\n\"At this time of year, special teams can win a series, win games,\" Rangers defenseman Adam Fox said after Tuesday's double-overtime win decided on - what else? - a power-play goal.\n\nAs Carolina forward Martin Necas said Wednesday: \"Everybody knows it's about the power plays and PKs. So far, they crushed us in those.\"\n\nCarolina has managed a total of 10 shots on goal on the power play so far.\n\n\"We've got to get a little more at the net, a little more inside,\" coach Rod Brind'Amour said. \"They're keeping us to the outside a little too much and we're settling for that.\"\n\nThe Hurricanes have plenty of stats that have gone in their favor, posting a 20-shot advantage (82-62) and a 188-142 edge in shot attempts. Carolina has also outscored the Rangers in 5-on-5 play (5-4) and even strength (6-4), while also doubling the Rangers in shots on goal (30-15) in the third period.\n\nCarolina has also won 53.1% of faceoffs through the two games, reversing road troubles from the first-round series against the New York Islanders (35%).\n\n\"Obviously it's frustrating because you don't feel like you deserve to lose two in a row there,\" Necas said. \"Special teams decided both of the games and they were better at those.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Aaron Beard contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP NHL

Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon led them with seven points (three goals, four assists) and 25 shots on goal in four regular-season games against the Stars.", "source": {"uri": "nhl.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NHL.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_Zibanejad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mika Zibanejad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Islanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Islanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Shesterkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Igor Shesterkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Guentzel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Guentzel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegas_Golden_Knights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegas Golden Knights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Hellebuyck", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor Hellebuyck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Seguin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Seguin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Dominoes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Dominoes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_ratio16_9-size50/prd/sukabni02sbpchjieiw6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-02", "textStart": 319, "textEnd": 325}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

If the 29-year-old can manage at least one tally on the road on Thursday, he'll make NHL history not seen since Buffalo Sabres forward Pat LaFontaine back in 1992.\n\n\"Valeri Nichushkin (8-1 -- 9 in 6 GP) was pivotal in Colorado's three-goal comeback win in Game 1 by scoring the first of his team's three straight goals in regulation,\" wrote NHL Public Relations. \"His string of success was established at the start of the 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs and enters Game 2 with the opportunity to join Pat LaFontaine (7 GP in 1992 w/ BUF) as just the second player in NHL history to score in each of his club's first seven games of a postseason.\"\n\nScoring in seven straight games in the regular-season is outrageous, and not something that is seen very often in the sport's highest league. But to do it in the postseason is absolutely unheard of -- and that's why it's only happened once before.\n\nWhen he's on the ice, Nichushkin has consistently been one of Colorado's best players, both in the regular-season and playoffs. He continues to dominate on the top line along with Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen as the Avalanche look to take a commanding lead in the series before the two teams head north to Ball Arena in Denver.\n\nValeri Nichushkin leads incredible Avalanche Game 1 comeback\n\nColorado was well-rested coming into the second-round, despite starting the series on the road, while Dallas was fresh off a thrilling Game 7 win over the defending champion Vegas Golden Knights earlier this week.\n\nThe Stars certainly had the edge early on, outshooting the Avalanche 9-5 in the first period -- and leading 3-0 on the scoresheet after goals by Ryan Suter, Wyatt Johnston and Jamie Benn.\n\nBut Nichushkin spurred the comeback in the second period, scoring a powerplay goal that opened the floodgates and led to three more unanswered tallies. The most important of the three was Miles Wood's overtime winner halfway through the extra frame.\n\nWhen the dust settled, the Avs had stolen Game 1, robbed the Stars of what looked like it was going to be a comfortable win, and set the stage to take a 2-0 series lead on the road on Thursday night.\n\nAnd they've also taken back home-ice advantage from the Central Division's top regular-season team.

Tyler Seguin Valeri Nichushkin Game 1 best bet  | TSN", "body": "On Sunday night, we said goodbye to the defending Stanley Cup champions.\n\nLast night, we watched the sleeper team of the NBA playoffs put the defending NBA champs on the ropes in their own building.\n\n24 hours after the Vegas Golden Knights were eliminated by the Dallas Stars in the NHL postseason, the Minnesota Timberwolves dealt the Denver Nuggets a humbling defeat in front of their home fans.\n\nThe Timberwolves beat the Nuggets 106-80 as a +245 underdog at FanDuel to take a 2-0 series lead on the road.\n\nDenver was bet up from -5.5 to -7.5 at FanDuel following the news that Minnesota would be without Rudy Gobert.\n\nIt wouldn't matter, as the Timberwolves cruised to a 26-point blowout victory.\n\nMeanwhile in the NHL, the Boston Bruins upset the Florida Panthers 5-1 in Game 1 of their second round series as a +134 underdog at FanDuel.\n\nI went 1-1 with the FanDuel Best Bets in Morning Coffee.\n\nConsidering how hot I've been running of late, the split certainly felt like a blowout loss as far as I'm concerned.\n\nTurning the page this morning, we have a pair of postseason games in both the NHL and the NBA tonight.\n\nI'm already locked in on what I'm expecting to be the most entertaining series of the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs with another pair of FanDuel Best Bets.\n\nThis is the Morning Coffee for Tuesday, May 7th, 2024.\n\nExpect Plenty Of Goals In Showdown Between Avalanche, Stars\n\nThe Stars went the distance against the Golden Knights in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nTheir path to the Stanley Cup Final won't get any easier against the Colorado Avalanche in the second round.\n\nColorado is -104 to advance to the Western Conference Final.\n\nWith so much star power on both rosters, my money is on this being one of the most entertaining series of the NHL postseason.\n\nIf the regular season was any indication, we should see plenty of goals.\n\nColorado won three of the four head-to-head meetings.\n\nThe average total in the four games was 8.75 goals.\n\nWhile conventional wisdom suggests fewer scoring opportunities in the playoffs, there's nothing conventional about what we saw from the Avalanche in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nFacing the obvious Vezina Trophy favourite Connor Hellebuyck, the Avalanche averaged a ridiculous 5.6 goals per game en route to eliminating the Winnipeg Jets in five games.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Jake Oettinger and the Stars can slow down Colorado's high-powered offence.\n\nFor the second morning in a row, I'm going to lock in a pair of FanDuel Best Bets in this column.\n\nFirst up, I'll parlay the alt over 5.5 goals in the game with Valeri Nichushkin to register 2+ shots on goal at -113.\n\nNichushkin registered at least three shots on goal in four of the five games in Colorado's first round series versus Winnipeg.\n\nHe averaged 3.4 shots on goal per game in that series.\n\nNichushkin also averaged 4.0 shots on goal per game against Dallas in the regular season with 12 shots in three meetings.\n\nSkating on the top line with Nathan MacKinnon and Mikko Rantanen, I'm confident that Nichushkin can get us the two shots we need to cash this Same Game Parlay.\n\nI'll lock in Nichushkin 2+ shots on goal and the alt over 5.5 goals at -113 as my first FanDuel Best Bet.\n\nNext up, I want to take advantage of a player that might fly under the radar for the Stars heading into this series in Tyler Seguin.\n\nWyatt Johnston was the star for Dallas in the first round with a team-high four goals and seven points.\n\nHis 31 scoring chances were 17 more than any other player on the roster.\n\nSecond on the team was Seguin, who failed to score a goal despite ranking second on the team with 21 shots on goal and second on the team with 14 scoring chances.\n\nWhile he failed to convert, I expect Seguin to be busy again in this series after scoring six goals in three games against Colorado during the regular season.\n\nSeguin registered 11 shots on goal in three games for an average of 3.66 per game.\n\nSeguin 3+ shots on goal is +132 at FanDuel this morning.", "source": {"uri": "tsn.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "TSN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 5,

Big plays at big moments, Jake (Oettinger, Stars goaltender) was incredible, so we need to keep building on that and keep getting better against an obviously very skilled team, very high-octane team with some of the best players in the world.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plain and simple -- they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got some really, really good players and we need to keep progressing our game as we did last series.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nThe Avalanche are here after eliminating the Winnipeg Jets in five games in their first-round series. They know the Stars well and figure the home team will be pushing from the start.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think we should expect anything but their best, their hardest game,\u00e2\u20ac Colorado center Nathan MacKinnon said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re prepared to work our butts off and compete and we expect a very, very, very hard series but we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re confident in ourselves. We feel we have a deep team, and we get the job done.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nHere are 3 keys for Game 1:\n\nWhen the puck drops in this game, it will be a week since the Avalanche last played. Many players on this roster were around in the 2022 Stanley Cup Playoffs, when Colorado won the Cup and had several long breaks in between rounds, anywhere from seven to 10 days between series. So, they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not worried about being ready.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s more mental,\u00e2\u20ac forward Mikko Rantanen said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I think, obviously, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s good physically. We get some rest, bumps and bruises you have, you can kind of get away from those. But mentally you have to be prepared, because they obviously played two days ago. Mentally we have to be prepared right away to be physical and make smart decisions with the puck.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nJoe Pavelski had no points in seven first-round games after the Stars forward finished with 67 points (27 goals, 40 assists) in 82 regular-season games, second on the team behind forward Jason Robertson (80 points; 29 goals, 51 assists).

They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re top-five. I expect them to push to score and push to keep it out of their net. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to do the exact same thing.\u00e2\u20ac\n\nValeri Nichushkin -- Nathan MacKinnon -- Mikko Rantanen\n\nArtturi Lehkonen -- Casey Mittelstadt -- Zach Parise\n\nKiviranta, a forward, participated in the Avalanche morning skate Tuesday in a noncontact jersey. \u00e2\u20ac| Georgiev will start after taking a maintenance day and not practicing Monday. ...

Colorado led all teams in the regular season with 304 goals for (including shootout-deciding goals), while Dallas led all teams in the 2023-24 season with eight different 20-goal scorers.\n\nOur AI-powered dfsPro model projects a number of individual performances worth keeping an eye on during Tuesday's second-round matchups. Let's dive into some of our favorite NHL player props for May 7!\n\nHurricanes winger Sebastian Aho averaged 0.68 assists per game during the regular season, but he has dished out just three helpers through six playoff games - including two in Game 1 of Carolina's first-round series against New York. As a result, our model projects a 19% decline below his average in Game 2 against the Rangers that still keeps him just above the betting line at 0.55.\n\nRangers center Vincent Trocheck averaged 2.62 shots per game during the regular season. He has exceeded that average in three of five postseason games, including Game 1 against the Hurricanes on Sunday. Our model projects Trocheck's shot potential to increase by more than 30% against his former team in Game 2, up to 3.42 shots on goal.\n\nCarolina defenseman Brent Burns hovered just around 0.5 points per game during the regular season, and he has maintained that average during the playoffs with three points (1 goal, 2 assists) through six postseason games. He recorded an assist in Game 1 against the Rangers on Sunday, and our model likes his chances to find the scoresheet again in Game 2, projecting a 37% uptick over his average point potential.\n\nAvalanche winger Mikko Rantanen averaged 3.39 shots per game during the regular season, but he put four shots on goal in each of his last two postseason games during Colorado's first-round series against the Winnipeg Jets. Our model likes him to continue that trend in Game 1 against the Stars, projecting a 7% increase over his average to 3.63 shots on goal.\n\nStars forward Matt Duchene put up just two points (1 goal, 1 assist) in seven games during Dallas' first-round series against the Vegas Golden Knights, but his regular-season numbers suggest that his point production is bound to increase during these playoffs.

Game 5 saw the Avalanche clinch the series in Winnipeg 6-3, thus pulling off the upset behind two goals from Mikko Rantanen in the third period.\n\nThe Avalanche haven't hoisted the Stanley Cup since 2022, while the Stars have been searching for their first championship since 1999.

In one corner, the Stars seemingly have everything you need to win a Cup in this day and age. High-end players up and down the lineup. A strong defensive corps. Goaltending (it doesn't have to be the best man in the world, it just has to show up). In the other? Nathan MacKinnon, all the quinoa pasta you can eat, and the same things I mentioned about Dallas. There is a strong chance that whoever comes out of this matchup could make it to the Cup final in June.\n\n* New York Rangers centre Mika Zibanejad is on a hot streak this postseason, currently on a five-game points streak (3 goals, 10 points).\n\n* Igor Shesterkin and the Rangers haven't lost a game yet this postseason. The Russian goaltender has been a huge reason why with a .921 save percentage with a 2.00 goals-against average.\n\n* Carolina Hurricanes forward Seth Jarvis is on a three-game goal-scoring streak (3 goals, 5 points).\n\n* Game 1 against the Rangers was the first time Carolina goalie Frederik Andersen allowed more than three goals in a playoff game this postseason. It's something that's only happened four times in his last 18 playoff appearances. You'd have to go back to 2015 when he was a member of the Anaheim Ducks to find the last time that's happened in back-to-back games (May 25-27, 2015).\n\n* This will be Nathan MacKinnon's second time in his career where he'll square up against the Dallas Stars in the playoffs, the first time since the 2020 postseason. In seven career playoff games against the Stars, MacKinnon has five goals and 12 points.\n\n* Here's Colorado goalie Alexandar Georgiev's record in his last four games: 4-0, a .932 save percentage and a 2.00 goals-against average. He's seemingly put behind that Game 1 performance where he allowed seven goals against Winnipeg in the opening round.\n\n* Dallas forward Wyatt Johnston will celebrate his 21st birthday on May 14, the legal drinking age in the United States. But he's already played in 26 playoff games (8 goals and 13 points) and is coming off a series where he scored four goals and had seven points in seven games.\n\n* Dallas goalie Jake Oettinger hasn't allowed more than two goals in his last six Stanley Cup playoff games (4-2, .942 SV%, 1.61 GAA).", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julian_mckenzie@theathletic.com", "name": "Julian McKenzie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Shesterkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Igor Shesterkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Jarvis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seth Jarvis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik_Andersen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frederik Andersen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mika_Zibanejad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mika Zibanejad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyatt_Johnston", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyatt Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandar_Georgiev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexandar Georgiev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim_Ducks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim Ducks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Oettinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Oettinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/06184406/GettyImages-2151622532-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-05-25", "dateEnd": "2015-05-27", "textStart": 1703, "textEnd": 1718}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 2304, "textEnd": 2310}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

I was just screaming 'Chip, chip, chip.' He made a great play, and from there on out, I just used my speed,\" said Wood, still breathing heavily from the game-winning play. \"I definitely kicked it into high gear there.\"Cale Makar had a goal and two assists for Colorado, while Valerie Nichushkin had a goal and an assist.

Here are three keys for Colorado to begin their second-round series in Dallas:\n\nRoad warriors\n\nThe Avalanche struggled away from Ball Arena in the regular season (19-16-6) before winning two-of-three playoff games in Winnipeg. Colorado will need similar success in Dallas inside another challenging road environment at American Airlines Center. There is plenty of familiarity between division opponents, especially among their respective fan bases. This should be fun.\n\nLet's go streaking\n\nArtturi Lehkonen and Valeri Nichushkin have scored at least one goal in all five playoff games entering the second round. Will their hot streak continue in Dallas? Lehkonen and Nichushkin have mastered the art of \"gritty\" goals. They always seem to be in the right spot at the right time to capitalize on opponent mistakes. Colorado needs to create net-front traffic and let these two players get to work.\n\nGame 1 Georgiev\n\nNerves heightened Monday afternoon among fans on social media when starting goaltender Alexandar Georgiev missed the team's final practice before flying out to Dallas. Don't be concerned. Georgiev took a maintenance day, coach Jared Bednar confirmed. Colorado's starting goaltender needs a clear mind to avoid repeating that Game 1 disaster in Winnipeg.

Although the Stars needed seven games to dispatch the Vegas Golden Knights, they are a very strong team top to bottom who just missed the Presidents' Trophy by one point. As always goaltending will likely shape this series in a clash of two 2024 All-Star goalies.\n\nIt was a mediocre regular season for the 25-year-old netminder who experienced a step back after an outstanding 2022-23 season in which he finished top five in Vezina Trophy voting. A 35-14-4 record with a .905 save percentage and 2.72 Goals Against Average and only a 2.7 Goals Saved Above Average left some doubts about whether Jake Oettinger could backstop the Stars to a Stanley Cup. Those concerns have been quieted after a strong performance in Dallas' first-round series defeat of Vegas. With a .925 save percentage and 1.95 GAA to go along with a Game 7 victory, the confidence will be riding high heading into the meeting with Colorado. It's a team that he has a 4-3-1 record against with a .915 save percentage and 3.06 GAA, so there's possibilities for success either way.\n\nAfter a disastrous Game 1 in Winnipeg, Alexandar Georgiev settled down and led the Avalanche to a first-round victory. The Jets saw their offense dry up and as a result didn't pepper Georgiev with the number of shots to make his statistics glow. With a .900 save percentage and 2.83 GAA it was good enough to get the job done, however, and quiet the cries for Justus Annunen to get a look in net. Georgiev will have to bring his best in this round and has seen success against Dallas with a 6-3-0 lifetime record, a .907 save percentage, and a 2.93 GAA.\n\nThis series should not see either backup factor in net but Scott Wedgewood did get in 32 games for the Stars in the regular season. Still, it's up to Oettinger to regain his Vezina-worthy form if the Stars are to make a real run. Annunen's illness removed the temptation to make a change in Colorado's net but with the team publicly rallying around Georgiev they know he's their guy. How long is the leash and is there any scenario (besides injury) Jared Bednar would start Annunen?

The Avalanche fell behind the Chicago Blackhawks 3-0 in the first period in Game 6 of the Conference Quarterfinals and rallied for a 6-3 victory April 16, 1997.\n\nThe goal-scorers in that game included Blackhawks defenseman Gary Suter and Avalanche center Joe Sakic. Suter is the uncle of Stars defenseman Ryan Suter, who scored the first goal Tuesday. Sakic is Colorado\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s president of hockey operations.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if we could come back or not but we wanted to at least try, and you never know what can happen in playoff hockey,\u00e2\u20ac Colorado center Nathan MacKinnon\u00c2 said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sometimes it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hard to hold leads.

The Stars were coming off a 4-3 win against the defending Stanley Cup champion Vegas Golden Knights in Game 7 on Sunday.\n\nThat was a big factor. Colorado was rusty early; Dallas was sharp. The Stars took a 2-0 lead, then padded it to 3-0 with a 5-on-3 power-play goal.\n\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We needed to ramp up, not settle down,\u00e2\u20ac Avalanche coach Jared Bednar said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That was an intense hockey game, and we got caught watching a few times. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to say lazy, but the work ethic and intensity and commitment that you need wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t there early, so we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re giving up chances, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re taking penalties, reaching, tripping.

Let's dive into some of our favorite NHL player props for May 9!\n\nRangers goalie Igor Shesterkin has a perfect 6-0 record so far in these playoffs, boasting a 2.01 goals-against average and a .929 save percentage. Prior to the Rangers' double-overtime win in Game 2 on Tuesday, when he faced 57 shots, Shesterkin hadn't faced more than 30 shots a any of his first five games of the postseason. However, our model projects the Hurricanes to turn up the heat on Shesterkin when the series returns to Raleigh tonight for Game 3, peppering him with 40 shots against. Our model projects Shesterkin to make 37 saves on those 40 shots, nearly 40% more than his average of 26.64 saves per game.\n\nVincent Trocheck was the hero for the Rangers in Game 2, scoring the winning goal against his former team in double overtime. It was his 10th point in six playoff games, and he has found the scoresheet in each of the Rangers' contests so far this postseason. Trocheck has recorded a goal and an assist in each of the first two games of the series against Carolina, and our model projects a 12% increase in his potential to dish out at least one assist tonight in Game 3.\n\nAvalanche center Nathan MacKinnon has found the scoresheet in each of Colorado's six games this postseason, recording multiple points in all but one of them. His shots on goal have been slightly less consistent, however, ranging from two to eight in the Avalanche's first-round series against the Winnipeg Jets. MacKinnon put four shots on goal in Game 1 against the Stars on Tuesday, and our projections indicate that he will not exceed that total tonight in Game 2. Specifically, our model projects a 10% decline below his regular-season average of 4.94 shots per game for tonight's contest, putting him just below the betting line at 4.42.\n\nDefenseman Cale Makar has been an offensive force for the Avalanche during these playoffs with 12 points through six games, but he has also blocked 13 shots during that span. His single-game high this postseason is currently four blocked shots in Game 2 against Winnipeg, but he only recorded one in Game 1 against Dallas. Our model projects a 26% decline from his average, down to 1.43 blocked shots tonight in Game 2.\n\nStars forward Wyatt Johnston averages 2.63 shots per game, but he managed to score a goal on just two in Game 1 against the Avalanche Tuesday. Our model projects an 11% decline below his average tonight in Game 2, placing him just below the betting line at 2.35 shots on goal.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_lingan@heavy.com", "name": "Emma Lingan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Shesterkin", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Igor Shesterkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Avalanche", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Avalanche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Hurricanes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carolina Hurricanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Trocheck", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vincent Trocheck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Stars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Stars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_MacKinnon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nathan MacKinnon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cale_Makar", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cale Makar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenceman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defenceman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnipeg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winnipeg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Balut", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2152055279-e1715293324157.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542122", "eventUri": "eng-9542122", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 501, "textEnd": 506}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

With one standout postseason under his belt, and in just his second full National Hockey League campaign, the 19-year-old has transformed into one of his team's best players as they battle for Central Division supremacy.\n\nJohnston has a chance to add his name to an impressive group of former players in Game 2 against the Colorado Avalanche at the American Airlines Center on Thursday night.\n\n\"Wyatt Johnston (5-3 -- 8 in 8 GP) has found the score sheet in six of eight games for the Stars during the 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs as the club now requires a rally from a series deficit to advance for the second time in as many rounds,\" wrote NHL Public Relations on Thursday.\n\n\"He can become just the eighth player age 20 or younger in NHL history with 10 or more points prior to his 10th game of a postseason; Wayne Gretzky (21 in 1981), Sidney Crosby (14 in 2008), Don Maloney (13 in 1979), Glenn Anderson (12 in 1981), Jari Kurri (12 in 1981), Rod Brind'Amour (11 in 1990) and Brent Sutter (11 in 1983) are the only ones to do so.\"\n\nIt would certainly be elite company if Johnston can find a way to record one more multi-point outing against the Avalanche in Game 2. That's obviously much easier said than done -- especially against a terrific Colorado team -- but it goes to show just how effective the youngster has been during this playoff run.\n\nCould Johnston already be Dallas' best player? His play has earned him a bump to 2C, as well as a promotion to the top power play group. And he's taking advantage.\n\nWyatt Johnston could legitimately be Stars' best player right now\n\nJohnston broke onto the scene in 2022-23, scoring 24 goals and 41 points in his rookie campaign. That's after he put up a head-turning 124 points in 68 games for the Ontario Hockey League's Windsor Spitfires the year before.\n\nThe Toronto native also came to play in his first postseason, scoring four goals and six points in 19 games as Dallas came within two wins of advancing to their first Stanley Cup Final since 2020.\n\nThe moment was never too big for the Canadian; he scored an absolutely monumental third-period goal in Game 7 against the Seattle Kraken in Round 2, helping the Stars reach the Western Conference Final.\n\nAlthough the Stars would lose to the eventual champion Vegas Golden Knights, it was a coming out party for Johnston in 2023. And he was even better this time around as Dallas exorcised the demons and eliminated Vegas in seven games.\n\n\"What a player,\" Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said about the 20-year-old. \"He still can't get in the casino and play cards, he's not old enough, it's unbelievable. One of ... the great young players, the next generation of stars of this league. I thought he was just outstanding for a kid to be under 21 years old and be on that ice with that level. Just an outstanding player.\"\n\nHigh praise from a coach to one of his top young players, and it's well-deserved. Johnston has legitimately been a top player -- if not Dallas' top player -- throughout the postseason. And the five goals and eight points in eight postseason games speaks for itself.\n\nAlthough some NHL history would be nice, the sophomore will be laser-focused on helping his team knot up what is already a thrilling series in Texas on Thursday night.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "colin_gallant@clutchpoints.com",

Vincent Trocheck got to play the role of hero in overtime there, his first game-winning playoff goal in 46 games.\n\nIn the time it took me to write this intro, the Avalanche erased a 3-0 deficit at the hands of the Dallas Stars. Miles Wood was the overtime hero, his first-ever game-winning playoff goal in 19 career postseason games. But the Stars have started from behind before, so be prepared for a long one with those two teams.\n\n* Vincent Trocheck is on a hot streak with goals in five consecutive playoff games. Trocheck also has points in each of his last six games (5 goals, 10 points).\n\n* Alexis Lafreni\u00e8re's breakout season continues. He already has two playoff goals this spring through six games.

Winning a single playoff series is a long, long way from the ultimate goal, but the last time both Dallas teams advanced to the second round, President Bush was a year away from running for re-election.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt has been a minute. Actually, 21 years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth the Stars and Mavs seem capable of more. The Stars are the No. 1 seed in the West and certainly have their hands full with Colorado but they can prevail. The Mavs go from playing the old guys in the gym (Clippers) to the new kids on the block (Thunder), but who's to say Oklahoma City is completely ready for the Luka and Kyrie Show? How far could this thing go? And should Dallas fans dream of the nearly impossible?\n\nSports Roundup\n\nGet the latest D-FW sports news, analysis, scores and more.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nIt's surprising, especially going back into the '50s and '60s when there were very few teams, but no city has ever pulled off the double -- winning the NBA title and Stanley Cup the same year. There have been several instances where teams from the same city reached both finals but none since 2003 when the New Jersey Devils beat Anaheim while the Nets lost to the San Antonio Spurs. Strangely, both the Devils (Newark) and Nets (Brooklyn) left town not long after.\n\nBefore that, you go back to 30 years ago when the New York Rangers ended their 54-year Cup drought against Vancouver but the Knicks came up short against the Houston Rockets. It just doesn't happen very often.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd while the two Dallas teams are very much alive and capable, they probably rank no better than fourth in the chance of pulling off the double finals this season. A look at the rest:\n\n1. New York, New York: The Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy and are so solid they feel like almost a lock to reach the Cup Final. The Knicks should get past Indiana but then they will have to find a way to upset the Celtics. An old rivalry, a young Knicks team, Jalen Brunson reaching superstar levels -- it could happen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Mile High Titles: The Nuggets are the defending NBA champs even if they have their hands full in the second round with Minnesota. The Avalanche incredibly scored five or more goals in all five playoff games against Winnipeg, the best defensive team in the league. Dallas needs veteran players like Joe Pavelski and Tyler Seguin and Roope Hintz to step up and eliminate the Denver consideration here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3. Brewing in Boston: The Celtics ran away with the best record in the NBA and should get past Cleveland without great difficulty before stepping up against, presumably, the Knicks. The Bruins needed overtime against Toronto on Saturday to avoid the embarrassment of becoming the first team to blow 3-1 first-round leads in consecutive seasons. Now they're seeking revenge against a Florida team that's better than they are, but it's hockey and the Bruins are breathing a sigh of relief.\n\n4. Dallas, City of Champions: It feels premature in the case of the Mavericks. But this team obviously has surprised me and many others since Irving got healthy two months before the end of the season, igniting a run that got Dallas from play-in status to the No. 5 seed. Even if they messed around in two games, they weren't overly threatened by the Clippers. The Thunder's size inside and their outstanding defensive guards will make this a different test than going up against the Harden, George, Westbrook trio of old.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs good as Luka Doncic is, it's probably wise to remember that Shai-Gilgeous Alexander almost certainly finished ahead of him in this season's MVP race. But the Thunder will find Dallas a much different opponent than the Pelicans without Zion Williamson, so expect a long series.\n\nThe Stars have to step up in the scoring department and can't lose their defensive connection when playing Colorado because Cale Makar, Nathan MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen and former Star Val Nichushkin will make you pay. It's hard to know whether Colorado goalie Alexandar Georgiev is as hot as he appeared or whether the Jets, who aren't nearly as skilled as Dallas, simply withered under the pressure once they were down.\n\nRegardless, American Airlines Center will be the home of hot tickets at least into the middle of May and perhaps beyond. That's something new around here. Enjoying the ride is what this whole sporting thing should be about. And who knows when history will be made.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFind more Mavericks coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.\n\nFind more Stars coverage from The Dallas Morning News here.", "source": {"uri": "dallasnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Dallas Morning News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Dallas is one of four sports cities chasing NBA, NHL titles at same time", "body": "DALLAS -- Mavericks fans and Stars fans, take a moment to catch your breath, toast each other and enjoy this.\n\nShout out also to all the Victory Park restaurants and ice cream shops that did not exist when I lived there 15 years ago. Winning a single playoff series is a long, long way from the ultimate goal, but the last time both Dallas teams advanced to the second round, President Bush was a year away from running for re-election.\n\nIt has been a minute. Actually, 21 years.\n\nBoth the Stars and Mavs seem capable of more. The Stars are the No. 1 seed in the West and certainly have their hands full with Colorado but they can prevail. The Mavs go from playing the old guys in the gym (Clippers) to the new kids on the block (Thunder), but who's to say Oklahoma City is completely ready for the Luka and Kyrie Show? How far could this thing go? And should Dallas fans dream of the nearly impossible?\n\nIt's surprising, especially going back into the '50s and '60s when there were very few teams, but no city has ever pulled off the double -- winning the NBA title and Stanley Cup the same year. There have been several instances where teams from the same city reached both finals but none since 2003 when the New Jersey Devils beat Anaheim while the Nets lost to the San Antonio Spurs. Strangely, both the Devils (Newark) and Nets (Brooklyn) left town not long after.\n\nBefore that, you go back to 30 years ago when the New York Rangers ended their 54-year Cup drought against Vancouver but the Knicks came up short against the Houston Rockets. It just doesn't happen very often.\n\nAnd while the two Dallas teams are very much alive and capable, they probably rank no better than fourth in the chance of pulling off the double finals this season. A look at the rest:\n\n1. New York, New York: The Rangers won the Presidents' Trophy and are so solid they feel like almost a lock to reach the Cup Final. The Knicks should get past Indiana but then they will have to find a way to upset the Celtics. An old rivalry, a young Knicks team, Jalen Brunson reaching superstar levels -- it could happen.\n\n2. Mile High Titles: The Nuggets are the defending NBA champs even if they have their hands full in the second round with Minnesota. The Avalanche incredibly scored five or more goals in all five playoff games against Winnipeg, the best defensive team in the league. Dallas needs veteran players like Joe Pavelski and Tyler Seguin and Roope Hintz to step up and eliminate the Denver consideration here.\n\n3. Brewing in Boston: The Celtics ran away with the best record in the NBA and should get past Cleveland without great difficulty before stepping up against, presumably, the Knicks. The Bruins needed overtime against Toronto on Saturday to avoid the embarrassment of becoming the first team to blow 3-1 first-round leads in consecutive seasons. Now they're seeking revenge against a Florida team that's better than they are, but it's hockey and the Bruins are breathing a sigh of relief.\n\n4. Dallas, City of Champions: It feels premature in the case of the Mavericks. But this team obviously has surprised me and many others since Irving got healthy two months before the end of the season, igniting a run that got Dallas from play-in status to the No. 5 seed. Even if they messed around in two games, they weren't overly threatened by the Clippers. The Thunder's size inside and their outstanding defensive guards will make this a different test than going up against the Harden, George, Westbrook trio of old.\n\nAs good as Luka Doncic is, it's probably wise to remember that Shai-Gilgeous Alexander almost certainly finished ahead of him in this season's MVP race. But the Thunder will find Dallas a much different opponent than the Pelicans without Zion Williamson, so expect a long series.\n\nThe Stars have to step up in the scoring department and can't lose their defensive connection when playing Colorado because Cale Makar, Nathan MacKinnon, Mikko Rantanen and former Star Val Nichushkin will make you pay. It's hard to know whether Colorado goalie Alexandar Georgiev is as hot as he appeared or whether the Jets, who aren't nearly as skilled as Dallas, simply withered under the pressure once they were down.\n\nRegardless, American Airlines Center will be the home of hot tickets at least into the middle of May and perhaps beyond. That's something new around here. Enjoying the ride is what this whole sporting thing should be about. And who knows when history will be made.\n\n\u00a92024 The Dallas Morning News.

Sling's channel lineup includes TNT and ESPN, so fans can watch every NBA (and NHL) playoff game.\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars got one day off between their Game 7 victory over last year's Stanley Cup champion, and the start of what could be a drastically different second round in the Western Conference playoffs against well-rested 2022 champ Colorado.\n\nCoach Pete DeBoer and the top-seeded Stars won a tight series against Vegas when each team scored 16 goals. They now face the Avalanche, who by time the puck drops for Game 1 on Tuesday night will have gone a full week since wrapping up their opening round with 28 goals in five games against one of the league's top defensive teams.\n\n\"We're going to have to work ourselves into the series to see how we're going to have to win,\" DeBoer said Monday. \"My initial reaction, just watching what they did to Winnipeg, is I don't think we want to get in a track meet. ... At the same time, we're not going to sit and try to defend in the entire series. I think we've got other layers to our game.\"\n\nDallas can score, too, with a franchise-record eight 20-goal scorers in the regular season and ranking third in the NHL at 3.59 goals per game. The Avs had a league-high 3.68.\n\nWhile the Stars hope to have an advantage going right from one series to another one, the Avalanche are drawing on experience from long layoffs during their 2022 Stanley Cup title run. They had a break of more than a week between the first and second rounds, and another before the final when they knocked off Tampa Bay in six games.\n\n\"We approached this week the same as we did then,\" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"The way you handle every situation it's not just like, you know, willy-nilly, you're trying to think of the best way to do it. You're gathering information from your team on rest, work, how they're feeling, what we can go over, just trying to fine-tune everything so we're ready to go when the puck drops.\"\n\nIn veteran center Nathan MacKinnon's view, the Avs should be ready for one thing: \"Their best, hardest game,\" he said. \"We're prepared to work our butts off and compete. We expect a very, very, very hard series. But we're confident in ourselves. We feel like we have a deep team and we get the job done.\"\n\nBIG SCORERS\n\nValeri Nichushkin had seven goals, the most by the 12 different Colorado players that found the net in the opening round. Nichushkin and Artturi Lehkonen are the first teammates in NHL history with simultaneous five-game goal streaks to open a postseason.\n\nOnly three other teams have opened the playoffs with at least five goals in each of their first five games. The Avs are the first since the 1994 New York Rangers, who then won their last Stanley Cup title.\n\nWinnipeg had allowed an NHL-low 2.41 goals a game in the regular season, while standout goalie Connor Hellebuyck had a 2.39 goals-against average in his 60 games.\n\nGOALIES\n\nStars goalie Jake Oettinger had a 1.95 goals-against average and .925 save percentage against the Knights, and stopped 73 of 74 shots in the third period or overtime.\n\nOettinger allowed more than two goals only once over the last 11 regular-season games. The lone exception was a 7-4 win at Colorado on April 7 -- he allowed 14 goals in three regular-season appearances against the Avs.\n\n\"The third period-overtime numbers show what we already knew here, that he's a rise-to-the-occasion guy,\" DeBoer said. \"He recognizes the big moments, the important times of a series, of a game. And he finds another level for us, regardless of what's happened before.\"\n\nColorado was 3-1 this season against the Stars, with Alexander Georgiev in net for all of them, also allowing 14 goals with an extra game.

Sling's channel lineup includes TNT and ESPN, so fans can watch every NBA (and NHL) playoff game.\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars got one day off between their Game 7 victory over last year's Stanley Cup champion, and the start of what could be a drastically different second round in the Western Conference playoffs against well-rested 2022 champ Colorado.\n\nCoach Pete DeBoer and the top-seeded Stars won a tight series against Vegas when each team scored 16 goals. They now face the Avalanche, who by time the puck drops for Game 1 on Tuesday night will have gone a full week since wrapping up their opening round with 28 goals in five games against one of the league's top defensive teams.\n\n\"We're going to have to work ourselves into the series to see how we're going to have to win,\" DeBoer said Monday. \"My initial reaction, just watching what they did to Winnipeg, is I don't think we want to get in a track meet. ... At the same time, we're not going to sit and try to defend in the entire series. I think we've got other layers to our game.\"\n\nDallas can score, too, with a franchise-record eight 20-goal scorers in the regular season and ranking third in the NHL at 3.59 goals per game. The Avs had a league-high 3.68.\n\nWhile the Stars hope to have an advantage going right from one series to another one, the Avalanche are drawing on experience from long layoffs during their 2022 Stanley Cup title run. They had a break of more than a week between the first and second rounds, and another before the final when they knocked off Tampa Bay in six games.\n\n\"We approached this week the same as we did then,\" Colorado coach Jared Bednar said. \"The way you handle every situation it's not just like, you know, willy-nilly, you're trying to think of the best way to do it. You're gathering information from your team on rest, work, how they're feeling, what we can go over, just trying to fine-tune everything so we're ready to go when the puck drops.\"\n\nIn veteran center Nathan MacKinnon's view, the Avs should be ready for one thing: \"Their best, hardest game,\" he said. \"We're prepared to work our butts off and compete. We expect a very, very, very hard series. But we're confident in ourselves. We feel like we have a deep team and we get the job done.\"\n\nBIG SCORERS\n\nValeri Nichushkin had seven goals, the most by the 12 different Colorado players that found the net in the opening round. Nichushkin and Artturi Lehkonen are the first teammates in NHL history with simultaneous five-game goal streaks to open a postseason.\n\nOnly three other teams have opened the playoffs with at least five goals in each of their first five games. The Avs are the first since the 1994 New York Rangers, who then won their last Stanley Cup title.\n\nWinnipeg had allowed an NHL-low 2.41 goals a game in the regular season, while standout goalie Connor Hellebuyck had a 2.39 goals-against average in his 60 games.\n\nGOALIES\n\nStars goalie Jake Oettinger had a 1.95 goals-against average and .925 save percentage against the Knights, and stopped 73 of 74 shots in the third period or overtime.\n\nOettinger allowed more than two goals only once over the last 11 regular-season games. The lone exception was a 7-4 win at Colorado on April 7 -- he allowed 14 goals in three regular-season appearances against the Avs.\n\n\"The third period-overtime numbers show what we already knew here, that he's a rise-to-the-occasion guy,\" DeBoer said. \"He recognizes the big moments, the important times of a series, of a game. And he finds another level for us, regardless of what's happened before.\"\n\nColorado was 3-1 this season against the Stars, with Alexander Georgiev in net for all of them, also allowing 14 goals with an extra game. He had a 3.03 GAA and .893 save percentage in the first round against Winnipeg.\n\nVETS SEEKING CUP\n\nAvalanche forward Zach Parise and Dallas defenseman Ryan Suter are former teammates and good friends who still hope to hoist the Stanley Cup for the first time.\n\nParise and Suter, both 39 years old, were together for nine seasons with the Minnesota Wild from 2012-21.\n\nSuter is in his third season with Dallas, where he signed in free agency after leaving the Wild, and his 1,444 career regular-season games are the most ever for a player without a Cup title.

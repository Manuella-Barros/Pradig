Indeed, according to Nio Chief Executive William Li, the company's newly-created sub-brand, Onvo, is intended to rival Tesla's best-selling Model Y EV.\n\n\"Nio is currently working on the launch of new car brands, that would be less premium, still obviously 100% electric, and more suited for the European market needs,\" Nicolas Vincelot, general manager for France, said during a France-China business forum in Paris.\n\nJust today, the official Onvo website launched in China, with a hint to \"stay tuned\" for info on its new L60 model. The first Onvo L60s are expected to launch in Europe before year-end.\n\nInterestingly, Onvo isn't the only new brand in the works for Nio. The EV giant is also working on a second brand, currently code-named Firefly. Firefly models will reportedly be designed for city driving and will also be sold in Europe. Though the Firefly brand won't be properly unveiled until 2025, it is expected to sell for less than $30,000 a pop, according to Vincelot.\n\nOne image of a prototype Firefly model displayed in Chinese auto media outlets shows a small-statured four-door hatchback.\n\nNIO stock has been on something of a hot streak lately. Indeed, NIO is up almost 21% over the past five trading sessions, in the green 30% over the past month.\n\nUnfortunately, even Nio hasn't been immune to this year's EV selloff. Nio is still in the red overall in 2024, down 32% year-to-date. Not alone, however, most EV makers have suffered brutal losses due to dwindling sales. This especially applies to Tesla, licking its wounds as it attempts to reverse its 25% losses this year.", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shrey_dua@investorplace.com", "name": "Shrey Dua", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nio_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nio Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firefly (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla_Model_Y", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla Model Y"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romain_Vincelot", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romain Vincelot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hatchback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Toys_and_Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Toys and Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nio1600b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543638", "eventUri": "eng-9543638", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

According to a senior executive from Nio in a Monday statement to Reuters, Nio is looking to unveil the L60 under the mass-market brand sometime this month, along with a second, smaller EV, which it plans to sell in Europe next year under another sub-brand.\n\nNIO plans to enter the U.S. by 2025\n\n\"Nio is currently working on the launch of new car brands, that would be less premium, still obviously 100 percent electric, and more suited for the European market needs,\" said Nicolas Vincelot, Nio's general manager for France, during a recent forum.\n\nThe Onvo web page says users should \"stay tuned\" for the launch of the L60, and Vincelot says that more details on the EV will be shared in the coming weeks.\n\nOnvo is the first sub-brand Nio is aiming to launch, previously code-named \"Alps.\" The second is being developed under the code-name Firefly, set to develop smaller, sub-$30,000 EVs dedicated to city driving. Both Onvo and the Firefly brand are expected to target the European market, while the latter is expected to be unveiled next year, according to Vincelot.\n\nIn addition, vehicles from both of the company's sub-brands will still be able to utilize Nio's battery-swapping stations.\n\nLast month, Nio entered into a partnership with CATL to jointly develop longer-lasting EV batteries, in hopes to double the lifespan of current products. Nio also gained a $2.2 billion investment in December from a United Arab Emirates firm called CYVN Holdings.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

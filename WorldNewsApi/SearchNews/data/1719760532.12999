It said recorded data indicated the pilots manually controlled the plane for 21 seconds to stabilize it before reengaging the autopilot. The plane made a normal, controlled descent and didn\u2019t encounter further turbulence until it landed in Bangkok almost an hour later, the ministry said, adding that investigations are ongoing. Passengers have described the \u201csheer terror\u201d of the aircraft shuddering, loose items flying and injured people lying paralyzed on the floor of the plane. Twenty-six people remained hospitalized in Bangkok on Wednesday. Hospital authorities earlier said injuries included spinal or spinal cord damage, skull or brain injuries and damage to bones or internal organs. It was unclear what caused the turbulence. Most people associate turbulence with heavy storms, but the most dangerous type is so-called clear air turbulence. Wind shear can occur in wispy cirrus clouds or even in clear air near thunderstorms, as differences in temperature and pressure create powerful currents of fast-moving air. According to a 2021 report by the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, turbulence accounted for 37.6% of all accidents on larger commercial airlines between 2009 and 2018. The Federal Aviation Administration has said there were 146 serious injuries from turbulence from 2009 to 2021.", "summary": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) &#8212; Rapid changes in the gravitational force led to a 178-feet (54-meter) altitude drop of a Singapore Airlines flight that left one passenger dead and many others who were not buckled up injured in extreme turbulence last week, a preliminary investigation by Singapore&#8217;s Transport Ministry said Wednesday.

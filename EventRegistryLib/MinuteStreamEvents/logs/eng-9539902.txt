The move also comes at a time when the 51-year-old Kidd was being mentioned as a potential head-coaching candidate for the Los Angeles Lakers, where he previously served as an assistant. \"We are excited to have coach Kidd continue to lead our team throughout the coming years with this well-earned contract extension,\"\u009d Mavericks governor Patrick Dumont said in a statement released by the team. \"Kidd led our team to two playoff appearances in three seasons, and we are looking forward to his leadership in continuing to build and grow this already great franchise.\"\u009d In his first season, the Mavericks went 52-30 and reached the Western Conference finals, which they lost in five games to Golden State. Overall, Kidd has a 140-106 record coaching Dallas, and is 323-296 overall, including stops in Brooklyn and Milwaukee. \"Jason brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role which cannot be duplicated,\"\u009d general manager Nico Harrison said. \"He has earned the trust and respect of our players and that of so many across the league, and I look forward to working alongside him as we continue to build upon the culture and foundation of success he's helped foster throughout his tenure as head coach.\"\u009d ___ AP NBA:", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Division_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Division (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Harrison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240506110532-6638f826855d7866fa2abbe3jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

He guided the Bucks from 2014 until he was fired in January 2018 after a 23-22 start to the season.\n\nHe joined the Lakers in 2019 as an assistant coach and in his first season helped guide the Lakers to an NBA title. He stayed one more season before leaving to accept the head coaching job in Dallas.\n\njs/pb\n\nMore from this section\n\nStriking deals to end campus protests, some colleges invite discussion of their investments A look at commencement ceremonies as US campuses are roiled by protests over the Israel-Hamas war Stack Sports launches Stack Rewards to Save Youth Sports Families $100M", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@kulr8.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Harrison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/9c/e9ca2de9-f552-53a2-80df-678722994f37/66391eaa92c62.image.jpg?crop=512%2C269%2C0%2C36&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-01-", "textStart": 2006, "textEnd": 2018}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

He has earned the trust and respect of our players and that of so many across the league, and I look forward to working alongside him as we continue to build upon the culture and foundation of success he's helped foster throughout his tenure as head coach.\"\n\nKidd led the Mavericks to playoff appearances in two of his three seasons, and the team won 50-plus games in each of those campaigns. Dallas reached the Western Conference Finals in his first season as coach. The Mavericks may reach similar heights in 2024, as their playoff run is ongoing and both Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving are playing well and, more importantly, coexisting.\n\nThough Kidd's extension was hardly a surprise, its timing is notable. Why? The Lakers fired Darvin Ham and would have been interested in bringing Kidd aboard to replace him if the Mavericks coach was available.\n\nHere's what to know about Kidd's contract extension and the rumors about his candidacy with the Lakers.\n\nNOH: Why J.J. Redick should (and shouldn't) be the Lakers' next coach\n\nThe full details of Kidd's contract with the Mavericks are not yet known. What is known is that he signed a multi-year deal to remain in Dallas, which will give him security in what is his third career NBA head coaching stop.\n\nKidd's original contract was set to expire following the 2024-25 NBA season, so Dallas is being proactive in retaining the veteran head coach. And as mentioned, the team may have been willing to put pen to paper to avoid any temptation Kidd may have had to join the Lakers and try to guide LeBron James' squad to an NBA title.\n\nNOH: Breaking down Paul George's best free agency landing spots\n\nKidd was expected to be \"an obvious target for the Lakers\" during their coaching search if he became available, per long-time basketball reporter Marc Stein.\n\nLos Angeles holding an interest in Kidd would hardly be surprising. He worked as an assistant coach for the team from 2019 to 2021 and helped Frank Vogel lead the squad to an NBA championship during the COVID-impacted 2020 season.\n\nKidd's combination of high-level playing experience -- he is a 10-time All-Star and an MVP runner-up -- head coaching experience and relationship with members of the Lakers would make him a natural fit as Los Angeles' leader.\n\nBut the Lakers didn't expect to have a shot at Kidd with his extension looming, as Stein reported.\n\nI'm told that the Lakers, for their part, don't anticipate Kidd becoming a coaching free agent any more than they expect to have a shot at [Clippers coach Tyronn] Lue.\n\nStill, Kidd's extension in Dallas should officially quash any possibility of him rejoining the Lakers to take aim at another title. He will instead stick with the Mavericks, where he's closer -- for now, at least -- to achieving that same goal.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Harrison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nico Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/Jason%20Kidd%20050624.jpg?itok=810cLBG0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

As they embark on their search for a new leader, an intriguing name has emerged in the mix as reported by Dave McMenamin: Jason Kidd, the current head coach of the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nAmidst speculation and deliberation about potential candidates, McMenamin reported on Sportscenter that Kidd is being considered by the Lakers organization. With a desire to pivot towards an experienced candidate, Kidd's name joins the list alongside other notable figures like Tyronn Lue and JJ Redick.\n\nKidd's candidacy brings with it a wealth of experience and a connection to Lakers superstar LeBron James. Having played alongside a young LeBron during their time with Team USA, Kidd shares a history with the Lakers' franchise player, potentially influencing the selection process.\n\nHowever, while the rumors swirl, Kidd remains focused on his current role with the Mavericks. Following a decisive victory over the Los Angeles Clippers to secure a spot in the conference semifinals, Kidd emphasized his dedication to guiding his team through the playoffs.\n\nWith his sights set on upcoming matchups against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Kidd's immediate priority lies in leading the Mavericks to success in the postseason.\n\nWhile the Lakers weigh their options and navigate the coaching landscape, the allure of securing a proven leader like Kidd looms large. His track record as both a player and a coach, coupled with his ties to LeBron James, make him an intriguing candidate for the Lakers' head coaching position.\n\nAs the Lakers' front office deliberates and the coaching carousel spins, the saga surrounding Jason Kidd's potential move to Los Angeles adds an intriguing subplot to the NBA offseason narrative. Whether he remains with the Mavericks or ventures into a new coaching role, Kidd's impact on the league is sure to be felt in the seasons to come.\n\nThere Is No Logical Reason For Jason Kidd To Join The Lakers\n\nJason Kidd's potential move to the Los Angeles Lakers may seem illogical when considering the current state of both franchises. The Dallas Mavericks, led by a young and blossoming Luka Doncic, present a compelling case for Kidd to remain at the helm. With Doncic showcasing his superstar potential and the presence of seasoned players like Kyrie Irving, the Mavericks offer a promising future.\n\nContrastingly, the Lakers' roster appears less stable, with LeBron James nearing the twilight of his career and Anthony Davis grappling with injury concerns. Beyond these two stars, the Lakers lack a cohesive system and a roster depth that can compete at the highest level.\n\nFurthermore, the Mavericks boast a culture of dedication and ambition among their young players, creating an environment conducive to growth and success. In contrast, the Lakers are mired in uncertainty, lacking a clear direction and identity.\n\nFor Kidd, the allure of coaching a team with a budding superstar like Doncic, coupled with the Mavericks' upward trajectory, provides little incentive to depart for the Lakers. The Mavericks offer stability, potential, and a roster filled with talent eager to succeed, making them an attractive option for Kidd to continue his coaching journey.\n\nAdditionally, the intense scrutiny and pressure that accompany coaching the Lakers may deter Kidd from making the switch. With expectations sky-high and a demanding fanbase, the Lakers' coaching role presents a formidable challenge that may not align with Kidd's aspirations.\n\nWhile the Lakers may be a storied franchise with a rich history, the Mavericks offer a more compelling opportunity for Jason Kidd at this juncture. With a young superstar in Luka Doncic and a promising roster, the Mavericks provide stability and potential for success, factors that outweigh the uncertainties surrounding the Lakers.\n\nThus, from a logical standpoint, there is little reason for Kidd to entertain the idea of joining the Lakers when he has a promising situation in Dallas.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vishwesha_kumar@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Vishwesha Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyronn_Lue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyronn Lue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsCenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SportsCenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MTk4ODQ1MzEzMzk0MDc1/441053019_1000088534873224_7592708409324333703_n.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

After getting eliminated in the first round by the Denver Nuggets and with how they played to close out the season, the Lakers fired head coach Darvin Ham. Now, they are looking to find the right head coach to lead the team in James' last year with the team.\n\nUpon Ham's firing, various reports listed some names the team could target. One option was Ty Lue, James' former coach with the Cleveland Cavaliers. But that was ruled to be unlikely by ESPN senior NBA insider Wojnarowski, who says the Clippers are aiming to make it to sign Lue to a contract extension.\n\nWhile Lue appears to be off the board, one candidate is officially off the table for the Lakers.\n\nOn Monday, the Dallas Mavericks officially announced that they signed head coach Jason Kidd to a multi-year contract extension.\n\nLakers coaching candidate Jason Kidd re-signed by Mavericks\n\nKidd's name was brought up by NBA correspondent Marc Stein ($), who said he would be a candidate if he were to be made available. But Stein said that it's unlikely that Kidd would be an option for the Lakers, with the expectation the Mavericks would keep him on a contract extension. Stein closed out his reporting by saying he was told the Lakers were not expecting Kidd to be a free agent.\n\nThe former NBA point guard did have history with the Lakers, serving as an assistant coach from 2019 until 2021 under Frank Vogel. In 2020, Kidd and the Lakers won an NBA Championship.\n\nRealistically, Kidd wasn't going to be an option, considering the Mavericks' season is still alive. The Mavericks beat the Clippers in six games in the opening round of the playoffs, and are now set to take on the No. 1 Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round.\n\nKidd was hired by the Mavericks to be their head coach in 2021. In his first season, Kidd led the Mavericks to the Western Conference Finals, where they ultimately lost in five games to the eventual NBA champion Golden State Warriors. After missing the playoffs last season, Kidd is looking to bring Dallas back to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2011.\n\nIn three seasons with the team, Kidd has a 140-106 regular-season record, and a 13-11 playoff record as of this writing (before start of Thunder second-round series).\n\nThe Lakers knew the chances of Kidd being available in free agency was slim, but now they can officially cross his name of their head coaching wish list.", "source": {"uri": "fansided.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FanSided"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_rogust@fansided.com", "name": "Scott Rogust", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4960,h_2790,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/229/01hx71er7wz8ctfa3pm9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

At the end of last week, the Lakers informed Darvin Ham as well as the rest of the coaching staff that they were being let go. Rumors abound that the Lakers were looking at current Los Angeles Clippers head coach Tyronn Lue and current Dallas Mavericks head coach Jason Kidd among others for their coaching vacancy.\n\nBut now it appears as if the Lakers are moving on from targeting either Tyronn Lue or Jason Kidd as per longtime NBA insider Marc Stein. Stein reported that the Lakers no longer consider Lue or Kidd to be realistic targets. Lue is reportedly looking to sign a long term extension with the Clippers while Kidd is reportedly in the same boat with the Mavericks.\n\nAlthough the Clippers were eliminated in the first round of the NBA Playoffs, it's believed that both sides are amicable to getting an extension done ahead of the team's move to a new arena for the 2024-25 season. It's also tough to envision Kidd going anywhere as the Mavericks are in the midst of a highly successful season and have done well overall in the three years that Kidd's been at the helm.\n\nWith Kidd and Lue seemingly out of the picture, the Lakers pool of available coaching candidates is a lot smaller. Not that Kidd or Lue were viable targets to begin with, but the Lakers short list shrinks even more.\n\nBut despite Darvin Ham's shortcomings as a coach, he did the best he could with the team he was given. One could argue that Ham and the Lakers actually overachieved during his first year in 2022-23. The Lakers came into the 2023 postseason as the No. 7 seed having had to go through the play-in tournament to reach the playoffs.\n\nDespite that, the Lakers actually won two playoff series and advanced to the Western Conference Finals even though they were not that good of a team. This season, they finished just about where most people expected them to. A low playoff seed and a first round exit.\n\nBut that wasn't good enough for Ham who was fired with two years remaining on his contract. So with Lue and Kidd out, where do the Lakers turn in terms of their coaching search?\n\nOne name that has popped up in recent days is former NBA player JJ Redick. Redick has no previous head coaching experience and has instead moved over to the media and broadcasting side of things since his retirement.\n\nRedick being mentioned as a possible head coach actually did not originate with the Lakers. His name first came with the Charlotte Hornets looking to replace Steve Clifford who is moving into a front office role. Redick apparently has the respect of LeBron James and the two recently formed a new podcast entitled, 'Mind the Game.'", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_yapkowitz@clutchpoints.com", "name": "David Yapkowitz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyronn_Lue", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyronn Lue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amway Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NBA-rumors-Why-Lakers-are-giving-up-on-Ty-Lue-Jason-Kidd-coaching-pursuit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

They'll be on the road for Game 1 vs. the Oklahoma City Thunder. Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving have been catalysts for Dallas in the 2024 postseason. Additionally, head coach Jason Kidd has set his team up for success.\n\nThat's why the Clippers and Kidd have signed a multi-year extension as of this morning. Even with the playoffs going on, the Mavericks wanted to make sure they had their head coach locked up. Insiders around the league had rumored Jason Kidd as a candidate for the Lakers' head coaching vacancy. Dallas was not going to let Jason Kidd walk. Now, the Mavs look to take the underdog approach in this series vs. the Thunder and play with no pressure. How far can they make it in the 2024 playoffs?\n\nThe 2023-24 season was Jason Kidd's third year as head coach of the Dallas Mavericks. His regular season record is 140-106, with two 50+ win seasons. Kidd has also led the Mavericks to two playoff appearances in three seasons. Including a trip to the Western Conference Finals in his first year as head coach. They lost to the Suns in six games. In the 2024 playoffs, the Mavericks have advanced to the second round and have a tough series ahead. Dallas is facing a young, talented, and competitive Thunder squad.\n\nJason Kidd has learned from his previous head coaching experience and is excelling with the Mavericks. He has experience as head coach of the Nets for one season and he was head coach in Milwaukee for four seasons. General Manager Nico Harrison had this to say about Jason Kidd and what he means to the Mavericks.\n\n\"I have known Jason for a long time, and I cannot think of a better, more qualified candidate to lead this team going forward,\" stated General Manager Nico Harrison. \"As a former NBA Champion Hall of Fame player, Jason brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role which cannot be duplicated. He has earned the trust and respect of our players and that of so many across the league, and I look forward to working alongside him as we continue to build upon the culture and foundation of success he's helped foster throughout his tenure as head coach.\"\n\nLos Angeles thought Jason Kidd might be available for hire and needed a new head coach after firing Darvin Ham. The Mavericks were not going to let Kidd go coach for a Western Conference competitor. Dallas is trying to get back to the top of the NBA mountain top. Right now, they have the right head coach and will continue building their roster over the next few years.

Redick, among others.\n\nThe Lakers will be hiring their fourth different coach in seven seasons. They also enter the off-season with some uncertainty within their roster, as star forward LeBron James told reporters last month that he needed to talk to his family and agent to decide on his basketball future.\n\nJames, 39, has a $51.4 million player option for 2024-25. He must decide to opt in or out by June 29.\n\nFellow All-Star Anthony Davis, forward Rui Hachimura and guards D'Angelo Russell and Austin Reaves remain under contract through next season.\n\nForward Taurean Prince, who averaged the sixth-most points per game (8.9) for the Lakers last season, is set to hit free agency. Prince started 49 games and made 78 total appearances in 2023-24.\n\nKidd and the Mavericks will face the Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 1 of their Western Conference semifinals series at 9:30 p.m. EDT

Among the desired replacements, Jason Kidd has ranked highly. However, the Mavericks head coach is expected to re-sign with Dallas, according to the respected Marc Stein.\n\n\"Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, who like [Tyronn] Lue has only one season left on his current contract, would also be an obvious target for the Lakers -- if Kidd were to become available. That, however, is not expected to happen. League sources say Kidd is also the likely recipient of a contract extension in the near future.\"\n\nStein also said that the Lakers are not under the delusion that either coach Kidd or Tyronn Lue will become available over the summer.\n\n\"I'm told that the Lakers, for their part, don't anticipate Kidd becoming a coaching free agent any more than they expect to have a shot at Lue.\"\n\nBoth Kidd and Lue are entering the final years of their respective coaching contracts and eyeing a massive payday next season. The coaching salary market has been reset over the last season with the contracts received by Gregg Popovich, Steve Kerr, Erik Spoelstra, and Monty Williams.\n\nCoach Kidd is in his third season with the Mavericks, going 140-106 over the regular season. In his two playoff appearances, he's made it to the second round at minimum and could take the Mavs to another Conference Finals this season if they can overcome the OKC Thunder.\n\nLast season's failure to make the playoffs for Dallas wasn't on Kidd as the team had an extremely flawed roster that was fully revamped, with Kidd orchestrating the best defense in the NBA over the last 25 regular season games after getting the personnel he needed with P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford.\n\nThe Lakers Need To Look Elsewhere\n\nJason Kidd is a former Laker, part of the coaching staff when the team won the 2020 Championship as Frank Vogel's lead assistant. Dallas snatched him up before the 2021-22 season to be their head coach, with him returning to the city as a franchise legend and former champion.\n\nKidd would have been a great choice given his familiarity with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, and because star players around the NBA have immense respect for Kidd. How he's dealt with Kyrie Irving over the last season is proof enough, as Kidd's coaching has kept Irving engaged and locked in throughout the season, something former MVP Steve Nash couldn't do.\n\nKeeping superstars bought in isn't easy and is usually achieved by respected former players. That's why the Lakers went after Darvin Ham in the first place and are currently pursuing Kidd and Lue. Their other options could include re-hiring Phil Handy as head coach after Handy was also fired as part of Ham's coaching staff.\n\nThe best option available seems to be former champion Mike Budenholzer, but even that might be a bad fit given that Ham is a direct result of Coach Bud's coaching tree, with Ham serving as Bud's assistant for their 2021 title triumph.\n\nOutside of these names, applicants such as JJ Redick, Charles Lee, and Micah Nori are also being evaluated for the job.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fadeaway World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ishaan_bhattacharya@fadeawayworld.net", "name": "Ishaan Bhattacharya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyronn_Lue", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tyronn Lue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Popovich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Popovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Nash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://fadeawayworld.net/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA2MjMyOTg2Mjc2ODY1MTIz/usatsi_21957753.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

They had a game plan, a really good game plan. They stuck to it and they executed it.\" Lue was one of the other potential candidates mentioned by McMenamin so it was a little ironic seeing these two coaches go against each other. All three candidates mentioned were former Mavericks players, as well.\n\nBoth Kidd and Lue have one year remaining on their current coaching contracts, but Kidd has been \"hopeful\" that he'll receive a contract extension from the Mavericks. If he doesn't get the extension he seeks, could he leave a year early to go back to Los Angeles? That likely won't be known until after the Mavericks' postseason run is over.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_veazey@si.com", "name": "Austin Veazey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyronn_Lue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyronn Lue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsCenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SportsCenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxi_Kleber", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maxi Kleber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2451,h_1378,x_0,y_334/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx2m03hge6n3gwgd41", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

However, after a strong final month of the regular season, the Mavs earned the Southwest division title and a strong position in the playoffs.\n\nOn Friday night, Dallas defeated the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 6 of the first round of the playoffs, advancing to face the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nThe team didn't immediately offer any details on the terms of the contract.\n\n\"I have known Jason for a long time, and I cannot think of a better, more qualified candidate to lead this team going forward,\" General Manager Nico Harrison said in the release. \"As a former NBA Champion Hall of Fame player, Jason brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role which cannot be duplicated.\n\nKidd won a NBA Championship as a player with the Mavericks in 2011.\n\n\"We are excited to have Coach Kidd continue to lead our team throughout the coming years with this well-earned contract extension,\" Dallas Mavericks Governor Patrick Dumont said in the release. \"Kidd led our team to two playoff appearances in three seasons, and we are looking forward to his leadership in continuing to build and grow this already great franchise.\"", "source": {"uri": "wfaa.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAA-TV Channel 8"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Harrison", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://media.wfaa.com/assets/WFAA/images/db847d31-8278-4c31-a880-8760ccacbb52/db847d31-8278-4c31-a880-8760ccacbb52_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Although Kidd's initial statement was humorous and blunt, the Mavs head coach then opened up on what the deal means to him.\n\n\"I'm very thankful for Patrick (Dumont) and Nico (Harrison) to be able to have a new deal moving forward,\" Kidd said. \"I truly believe Patrick and Nico are building a championship team and I'm happy to be apart of it.\"\n\nThe Mavs clearly believe in Kidd. Dumont, the Mavericks governor, and Harrison, the Mavericks president of basketball operations, have championship aspirations. They feel that Kidd is the right person for the job to lead the team moving forward. And that is something that Kidd does not take for granted.\n\n\"It means a lot,\" Kidd said. \"The work that the coaching staff and the players are putting in means a lot and hopefully they saw that. Through the good and the stuff that we had to get better at... This is a work-in-progress. This is a very talented team. To be apart of it, I'm very blessed.\"\n\nJason Kidd set to lead Mavericks for years to come\n\nIt is not just the Mavericks front office that has belief in Kidd. Players have spoken highly of the head coach. Mavs center Daniel Gafford also spoke to reporters on Monday and shared his thoughts on the news of Kidd's contract extension.\n\n\"My biggest congrats to him,\" Gafford said. \"Obviously well-deserved. One of the, I would say, best coaches this year from what I've been seeing. Just, you know, real poised. Knows how to really assert the dominance in the locker room when it comes to whenever we need to get our heads on straight. But in all honesty, the biggest congrats to him. Like I said, well-deserved. Something I'm pretty sure he's been working towards for the longest. I can't wait for what's next for the team.\"\n\nRumors recently swirled that were connecting Kidd to the Los Angeles Lakers head coaching position. Those rumors were quickly shut down as whispers emerged about a potential Kidd-Mavericks contract extension. Sure enough, the news was announced on Monday morning.\n\nJason Kidd has found success in Dallas so far as a head coach. He's led the team to two 50 or more win seasons. The Mavericks reached the Western Conference Finals during the 2021-22 campaign, which was Kidd's first season as Dallas' head coach. They missed the postseason in 2022-23 but rebounded in 2023-24.\n\nNow the Mavericks are preparing for a second-round playoff clash against the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nSo what is Kidd's message to Mavericks fans after signing his new contract extension?\n\n\"We're trying to win a championship,\" Kidd said. \"We're playing a very talented team in Oklahoma City. Understanding that the foundation is being built. Our ultimate goal is to win a championship and hopefully we can do that here in the next three years.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joey_mistretta@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Joey Mistretta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mavericks-news-Jason-Kidds-coaching-legacy-set-for-huge-test-in-2024-playoffs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Among the desired replacements, Jason Kidd has ranked highly. However, the Mavericks head coach is expected to re-sign with Dallas, according to the respected Marc Stein.\n\n\"Mavericks coach Jason Kidd, who like [Tyronn] Lue has only one season left on his current contract, would also be an obvious target for the Lakers -- if Kidd were to become available. That, however, is not expected to happen. League sources say Kidd is also the likely recipient of a contract extension in the near future.\"\n\nStein also said that the Lakers are not under the delusion that either coach Kidd or Tyronn Lue will become available over the summer.\n\n\"I'm told that the Lakers, for their part, don't anticipate Kidd becoming a coaching free agent any more than they expect to have a shot at Lue.\"\n\nBoth Kidd and Lue are entering the final years of their respective coaching contracts and eyeing a massive payday next season. The coaching salary market has been reset over the last season with the contracts received by Gregg Popovich, Steve Kerr, Erik Spoelstra, and Monty Williams.\n\nCoach Kidd is in his third season with the Mavericks, going 140-106 over the regular season. In his two playoff appearances, he's made it to the second round at minimum and could take the Mavs to another Conference Finals this season if they can overcome the OKC Thunder.\n\nLast season's failure to make the playoffs for Dallas wasn't on Kidd as the team had an extremely flawed roster that was fully revamped, with Kidd orchestrating the best defense in the NBA over the last 25 regular season games after getting the personnel he needed with P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford.\n\nThe Lakers Need To Look Elsewhere\n\nJason Kidd is a former Laker, part of the coaching staff when the team won the 2020 Championship as Frank Vogel's lead assistant. Dallas snatched him up before the 2021-22 season to be their head coach, with him returning to the city as a franchise legend and former champion.\n\nKidd would have been a great choice given his familiarity with LeBron James and Anthony Davis, and because star players around the NBA have immense respect for Kidd. How he's dealt with Kyrie Irving over the last season is proof enough, as Kidd's coaching has kept Irving engaged and locked in throughout the season, something former MVP Steve Nash couldn't do.\n\nKeeping superstars bought in isn't easy and is usually achieved by respected former players. That's why the Lakers went after Darvin Ham in the first place and are currently pursuing Kidd and Lue. Their other options could include re-hiring Phil Handy as head coach after Handy was also fired as part of Ham's coaching staff.\n\nThe best option available seems to be former champion Mike Budenholzer, but even that might be a bad fit given that Ham is a direct result of Coach Bud's coaching tree, with Ham serving as Bud's assistant for their 2021 title triumph.\n\nOutside of these names, applicants such as JJ Redick, Charles Lee, and Micah Nori are also being evaluated for the job.\n\nRelated: The Lakers Coaching Dream Scenario With Tyronn Lue, JJ Redick, Rajon Rondo And Phil Handy\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

The Dallas front office heard word of that and wasted no time keeping Kidd at the helm long-term. Before Kidd became the head coach for the Mavericks, he was the assistant coach for Los Angeles under Frank Vogel from 2019-2021, winning a title with the team in 2020.\n\nThe 51-year-old head coach was hired by the Mavs in 2021 and has led the team to two playoff appearances in three seasons, including a Western Conference Finals appearance in 2022. This season, he's led the Mavs to the No. 5 seed in the Western Conference with a 50-32 record and will face the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round, which tips off on Tuesday.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers want to do the same with current head coach Ty Lue. There are reports that the Lakers are also interested in Lue as their next head coach. However, the Clippers front office and Lue are said to do what they can to agree on an extension.\n\nThe head coaching search will continue for the Lakers with little doubt on Lue and zero chance on Kidd.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ricardo_sandoval@si.com", "name": "Ricardo Sandoval", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Harrison", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nico Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2082,h_1171,x_0,y_407/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hx7jtkms9j5g6pec76", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

News emerged Monday morning that the organization has agreed to a multi-year extension with their head coach.\n\nKidd became coach of the Mavericks in 2022 after a brief stint with the LA Lakers as an assistant. Over the past three years, he's posted a regular season record of 140-106 and gone 13-11 in the postseason.\n\nFollowing their upset over the LA Clippers, the Mavericks are now gearing up to face the OKC Thunder in the Western Conference semifinals. With a new deal in place, Jason Kidd might now feel more at ease.\n\nWhile the Mavs have played well this season, here are some reasons Dallas shouldn't have signed their coach long-term.\n\nReasons why Jason Kidd doesn't deserve his contract\n\n1) Bailed out by star talent\n\nBy far the biggest thing that covers up Jason Kidd's inabilities as a coach is the stars on the roster. Luka Doncic is a generational talent that has dominated since he stepped foot in the NBA. Now, he has a new running mate in Kyrie Irving.\n\nDue to these team being able to create offense out of nothing, Kidd's blemishes often get overlooked. Most of the time when the Mavericks win a big game, it's because of Doncic's brilliance, not Kidd's.\n\n2) The collapse at the end of the 2023 season\n\nOne of the biggest reasons why the Mavs shouldn't have extended Kidd is because of what happened at the end of last season. After sitting in a playoff spot for a majoirty of the year, they completely fell apart down the stretch.\n\nPart of this was done so they could secure a higher draft pick. That said, how things played out for Dallas following the Irving trade should have been a massive red flag for the organization.\n\n3) Questionable rotations\n\nThroughout his coaching career, questionable rotations has been a thing often brought up with Jason Kidd. Even as the postseason rolls along now, many have questioned his decision making regarding lineups.\n\nOne of the key moves the Mavericks made at the trade deadline was bringing in Daniel Gafford from the Washington Wizards. He instantly proved to be a key piece for Dallas, but has recently seen his minutes shrink. In the playoffs, Maxi Kleber is getting more time than the veteran big man.\n\nThis is just one of many examples of Kidd making odd decisions with his rotations.\n\n4) Has always struggled on the defensive end of the floor\n\nEven as a player, Jason Kidd was most known for his offense. Throughout his coaching career, that has been more of the same. While Doncic is able to provide a ton of offensive firepower, the team has always struggled on the other end.\n\nThis season, Dallas was 18th in defensive rating. That mark was slightly ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks, who were just bounced in the first round. Kidd has never proven he's capable of elevating a team on that end, which could hinder the Mavs en route to becoming a true contender.\n\n5) Doesn't have a promising track record\n\nThe final reason why Jason Kidd shouldn't have gotten an extension is his track record. With Doncic entering his prime now, Dallas' window of contention is open. That said, Kidd has never proven he can be \"the guy\" to help coach a team to a championship.\n\nDating back to his time with the Brooklyn Nets and Bucks, Kidd's teams have always floated around .500. The same goes for the playoffs, where he is 22-26 as a coach.\n\nArmed with one of the top young superstars in the game, the Mavericks need someone at the helm who can get them over the hump. Looking at his resum\u00e9, Kidd doesn't appear to be that kind of coach.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_mccormick@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Kevin McCormick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxi_Kleber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maxi Kleber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Wizards"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/22995706-1715006371.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

He had one season remaining on his current contract.\n\nKidd had been \"hopeful\" he would receive an extension, The Athletic's Sam Amick reported in late March. Now, he has it.\n\nKidd, who was hired in 2021 after front-office turmoil led to the departure of Rick Carlisle, has twice led the Mavericks past the first round of the playoffs. In 2022, the team made it to the Western Conference finals before falling to the eventual champion Golden State Warriors. Kidd recently steered the Mavericks past the LA Clippers in six games, setting up a West semifinals clash against the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder that begins Tuesday.\n\nBetween those two seasons, there was the 2022-23 campaign, which was a major step backward from where the team had been. Dallas finished 38-44 and missed the postseason entirely. There were fair criticisms of Kidd, but there were also many other factors that led to Dallas' catastrophic performances. Kidd never lost the locker room even after the team's midseason trade for Kyrie Irving, a transaction that was criticized by some for its perceived risk and especially so after the team's dismal finish.\n\nThis season, Dallas did the opposite, finishing the regular season with 23 wins in its final 31 games after making moves at the trade deadline for P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford. The two newcomers started every game in the Mavericks' first-round win over the Clippers. In this season's final months, Kidd, as he did in 2022, once again helped turn Dallas into one of the NBA's best defenses.\n\n\"My job is to make these young men better on and off the floor. You guys (the media) won't say that, but I think I've done that,\" Kidd said after a Sunday practice prior to the extension being announced. \"That's my job. You can see my teams don't panic because we've lost a game.\"\n\nIt's clear Kidd has evolved since his previous coaching stints, which lasted one season with the Brooklyn Nets and four more with the Milwaukee Bucks before he was fired halfway through the 2017-18 season. He has a career record of 323-296 and is 140-106 across three seasons in Dallas.\n\nKidd spent time as a lead assistant coach with the Los Angeles Lakers, helping the team win the 2020 championship, before Dallas sought him as a preferred candidate in the summer of 2022. He might have been a potential option for the Lakers' current head coaching vacancy had he not signed this extension with Dallas.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_cato@theathletic.com", "name": "Tim Cato", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Carlisle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rick Carlisle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/06095039/USATSI_22740365-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Former NBA Coach of the Year delivers scathing critique of Lakers following Darvin Ham firing\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers made waves in the basketball world on Friday night with the unexpected decision to part ways with head coach Darvin Ham. This bold move came on the heels of a disappointing playoff series loss to the Denver Nuggets, where the Lakers fell short with a 4-1 defeat in the first round. The abrupt departure of Ham and his coaching staff was met with mixed reactions from fans and analysts alike, but it was clear that changes were inevitable following the team's early postseason exit.\n\nAs speculation began to swirl about potential candidates to fill the vacant coaching position, one name emerged as a frontrunner: Jason Kidd, the current head coach of the Dallas Mavericks. According to insider Dave McMenamin, Kidd's extensive experience in the NBA coaching realm makes him a strong contender for the role.\n\nMcMenamin hinted during a Sportscenter segment, \"I expect the pendulum to swing back towards an experienced candidate this summer.\" He also revealed that other notable figures like Ty Lue, JJ Redick, and Jason Kidd are being considered for the position, adding fuel to the coaching carousel speculation.\n\nWhat adds intrigue to Kidd's candidacy is his personal connection with Lakers superstar LeBron James. The two basketball icons shared the court as teammates during their time with Team USA, fostering a bond that could potentially sway the decision-making process in Kidd's favor. Additionally, Kidd's track record as a player and coach in the NBA brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the table, making him an attractive option for the Lakers organization.\n\nDespite the buzz surrounding Kidd's potential move to Los Angeles, the Mavericks head coach remains focused on his current responsibilities with the Mavericks. Following a hard-fought victory over the Clippers, Kidd emphasized the importance of staying grounded and focused on the task at hand. \"We just enjoy it... We'll regroup on Sunday and then focus on Oklahoma City,\" Kidd shared during a post-game press conference, highlighting his commitment to the Mavericks' playoff journey.\n\nMeanwhile, the Lakers have made it clear that star players LeBron James and Anthony Davis will have a say in the coaching search process. Their involvement underscores the team's commitment to ensuring that key decisions align with the vision and goals of the franchise's cornerstone players.\n\nAs the coaching search unfolds and the NBA playoffs continue to captivate audiences worldwide, the basketball world remains abuzz with anticipation and excitement. With each passing day, new developments emerge, adding to the drama and intrigue of the sport.

On Monday, the franchise announced they had reached an agreement on a multi-year contract extension with Jason Kidd.\n\nKidd, fresh off his third series win as head coach in Dallas, has been with the organization since the 2021-'22 season. In his first year at the helm he got an unmatched level of defensive buy-in from Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and it resulted in a Western Conference finals appearance; there, the Mavs would fall to the eventual champion Golden State Warriors.\n\nKidd's squad stumbled in his second season at the helm. They finished 38-44, 11th in the West, despite trading for Kyrie Irving halfway through the year. But it's safe to stay they bounced back. Doncic and Irving's partnership blossomed under Kidd and a series of moves at the trade deadline finally gave Dallas the ideal roster to surround the two superstars. The Mavericks wrapped up the 2023-'24 season with a 50-32 record, finished fifth in the West, and beat the Clippers in six games to move on to the second round of the postseason.\n\nExtremely good vibes in Dallas, in other words. Great business sense by Kidd to negotiate his extension right now.\n\n\"We are excited to have coach Kidd continue to lead our team throughout the coming years with this well-earned contract extension,\" team governor Patrick Dumont said in the release. \"Kidd led our team to two playoff appearances in three seasons, and we are looking forward to his leadership in continuing to build and grow this already great franchise.\"\n\n\"I have known Jason for a long time, and I cannot think of a better, more qualified candidate to lead this team going forward,\" general manager Nico Harrison said. \"As a former NBA Champion Hall of Fame player, Jason brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role which cannot be duplicated. He has earned the trust and respect of our players and that of so many across the league, and I look forward to working alongside him as we continue to build upon the culture and foundation of success he's helped foster throughout his tenure as head coach.\"\n\nKidd's gone 140-96 in three seasons in Dallas and is now on board for a few more years. The pressure to deliver is always high when coaching a talent of Don\u010di\u0107's caliber, and Kidd has been rewarded for doing just that.

(AP Photo/Jeffrey McWhorter)DALLAS (AP) - Jason Kidd found a groove with Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving a season after a chaotic ending to the first two months together for the Dallas superstars. The Mavericks coach has his team advancing in the playoffs for the second time in his three years in charge, and the 51-year-old now has a contract extension to go with it. Kidd signed a multiyear deal Monday, the day before Dallas opens a second-round playoff series against Oklahoma City. The Mavs moved on by beating the Los Angeles Clippers in six games. A year ago, Dallas missed the playoffs after reaching the 2022 Western Conference finals in Kidd's debut as coach for the team he helped win a championship as a point guard in 2011. The blockbuster trade for Irving in February 2023 wasn't the catalyst the Mavs hoped for another postseason run. Instead, the team tanked at the end of the regular season to try to preserve a draft pick, even when there were still mathematical hopes of qualifying for the play-in tournament. Kidd was the front man for all the tough questions in the final days of the regular season, and got a vote of confidence from then-owner Mark Cuban. Dallas kept the draft pick, and first-rounder Dereck Lively II had a significant impact as a rookie center. \"Last year, we learned a lot about character, about the team,\"\u009d Kidd said. \"At the time, everyone had their opinion. But understanding what the plan is internally, I thought we executed the plan. Being calm and not losing your mind or being offended of what others say turned out to be the right thing.\"\u009d Irving re-signed with Dallas, and after Cuban sold his majority stake to the casino-linked families of Patrick Dumont and Miriam Adelson, a late-season surge lifted the Mavs to fifth in the West at 52-30. The extension for Kidd comes after his name surfaced in reports of the Lakers' coaching search. Los Angeles fired Darvin Ham last week. Terms of the deal weren't released. Doncic and Irving are under team control together for one more season. Irving has a player option in his contract for 2025-26, Doncic the following season. \"We are excited to have coach Kidd continue to lead our team throughout the coming years with this well-earned contract extension,\"\u009d said Dumont, who is the team's governor while Cuban has the role of alternate governor. \"We are looking forward to his leadership in continuing to build and grow this already great franchise.\"\u009d A hall of famer as a player, Kidd ended his career second on the all-time list for assists behind John Stockton. He went into coaching immediately upon retirement, leading Brooklyn to the second round of the playoffs in his first season in 2013-14 before Milwaukee hired him away from the Nets. The Bucks fired Kidd in the middle of his fourth season - with a pair of first-round playoff exits the first three years - and he spent two years as an assistant with the Lakers, including when LA won the NBA title in the 2020 playoff bubble. Kidd, who replaced Rick Carlisle in Dallas, has a 140-106 regular-season record with the Mavs and is 323-296 overall. After Kidd and NBA Finals MVP Dirk Nowitzki led the Mavs to the 2011 title, they didn't win another playoff series until beating Utah in the first round under Kidd two years ago. Now Dallas has three series victories in three seasons. \"Jason brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role, which cannot be duplicated,\"\u009d general manager Nico Harrison said. \"He has earned the trust and respect of our players and that of so many across the league.\"\u009d ___ AP NBA:", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"},

Kidd led our team to two playoff appearances in three seasons, and we are looking forward to his leadership in continuing to build and grow this already great franchise.\"\n\nIt's a savvy move by the Mavericks, as Kidd's name had been floating around in NBA coaching rumors, as a potential replacement for recently fired Los Angeles Lakers head coach Darvin Ham.\n\nKidd's coaching career started rather unremarkably, leading the ill-fated 2013-14 Brooklyn Nets \"super team\" to a second-round playoff exit, before heading to the Milwaukee Bucks. Kidd's most memorable moment of the season ended up being a cheap stunt to bend the rules.\n\nIn his 3.5 years with the Bucks, Kidd was gifted with 20-year-old soon-to-be superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo, yet his team had to sneak into the playoffs twice (being bounced twice in the first round), they missed the playoffs once and then Kidd was relieved of his duties after 45 games in his fourth year.\n\nAfter a two-year stint with the Los Angeles Lakers as an assistant coach, Kidd would join the Mavericks for the 2021-22 season, with another chance to mentor a young soon-to-be superstar in Luka Doncic. In his first seasons, Kidd amassed 52 regular season wins and a trip to the Western Conference Finals, losing in five games to the Golden State Warriors. After an injury-marred 2022-23, the Mavericks won 50 regular season games in 2023-24, earning the No. 5 seed in the Western Conference.\n\nWhile Kidd hasn't won the NBA Coach of the Year award (four-time winner of Coach of the Month), his coaching career is on an upward trajectory, with 140 regular season wins in the last three seasons.\n\nAs the Mavs prepare for their Western Conference Semifinal series against the Oklahoma City Thunder, there's clear reason for optimism, and the contract extension makes a ton of sense. Doncic has blossomed under Kidd, leading the NBA in scoring at 33.9 points per game in 2023-24, adding in 9.2 rebounds, 9.8 assists and 1.4 steals.\n\nThe Mavs aren't flush with cap space heading into the offseason, but they have Doncic locked up for two more years (player option in year three), Irving for one more year (player option in year two) to go with reasonably-priced contracts locking up PJ Washington, Daniel Gafford, Josh Green and Maxi Kleber for a minimum of two more seasons. Tim Hardaway Jr. has just one year left on his deal.\n\nIn a vacuum, the Mavericks are in fantastic shape to compete. They've got a young MVP candidate in Doncic, they have a former NBA Champion still near the top of his game in Kyrie Irving, and nearly every contributing member of the roster is signed through 2024-25. The only negative is that the Mavericks don't have a first-round pick in the 2024 NBA Draft.\n\nTheir core is locked up for multiple seasons and it wouldn't be a stretch to say Doncic could be the NBA's best player in the next few years. Kidd's contract extension ensures he'll get a front-row seat to see it happen.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_dunlap@heavy.com", "name": "Michael Dunlap", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giannis_Antetokounmpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Giannis Antetokounmpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hardaway_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tim Hardaway Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxi_Kleber", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maxi Kleber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Coach_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Coach of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151361095.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 110, "textEnd": 115}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The Mavs moved on by beating the Los Angeles Clippers in six games.\n\nA year ago, Dallas missed the playoffs after reaching the 2022 Western Conference finals in Kidd's debut as coach for the team he helped win a championship as a point guard in 2011.\n\nThe blockbuster trade for Irving in February 2023 wasn't the catalyst the Mavs hoped for another postseason run. Instead, the team tanked at the end of the regular season to try to preserve a draft pick, even when there were still mathematical hopes of qualifying for the play-in tournament.\n\nKidd was the front man for all the tough questions in the final days of the regular season, and got a vote of confidence from then-owner Mark Cuban. Dallas kept the draft pick, and first-rounder Dereck Lively II had a significant impact as a rookie center.\n\n\"Last year, we learned a lot about character, about the team,\" Kidd said. \"At the time, everyone had their opinion. But understanding what the plan is internally, I thought we executed the plan. Being calm and not losing your mind or being offended of what others say turned out to be the right thing.\"\n\nIrving re-signed with Dallas, and after Cuban sold his majority stake to the casino-linked families of Patrick Dumont and Miriam Adelson, a late-season surge lifted the Mavs to fifth in the West at 52-30.\n\nThe extension for Kidd comes after his name surfaced in reports of the Lakers' coaching search. Los Angeles fired Darvin Ham last week.\n\nTerms of the deal weren't released. Doncic and Irving are under team control together for one more season. Irving has a player option in his contract for 2025-26, Doncic the following season.\n\n\"We are excited to have coach Kidd continue to lead our team throughout the coming years with this well-earned contract extension,\" said Dumont, who is the team's governor while Cuban has the role of alternate governor. \"We are looking forward to his leadership in continuing to build and grow this already great franchise.\"\n\nA hall of famer as a player, Kidd ended his career second on the all-time list for assists behind John Stockton. He went into coaching immediately upon retirement, leading Brooklyn to the second round of the playoffs in his first season in 2013-14 before Milwaukee hired him away from the Nets.\n\nThe Bucks fired Kidd in the middle of his fourth season -- with a pair of first-round playoff exits the first three years -- and he spent two years as an assistant with the Lakers, including when LA won the NBA title in the 2020 playoff bubble.\n\nKidd, who replaced Rick Carlisle in Dallas, has a 140-106 regular-season record with the Mavs and is 323-296 overall.\n\nAfter Kidd and NBA Finals MVP Dirk Nowitzki led the Mavs to the 2011 title, they didn't win another playoff series until beating Utah in the first round under Kidd two years ago. Now Dallas has three series victories in three seasons.\n\n\"Jason brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role, which cannot be duplicated,\" general manager Nico Harrison said. \"He has earned the trust and respect of our players and that of so many across the league.\"\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/hub/nba", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald

After a 4-1 series loss to the Nuggets, the Purple and Gold were sent packing in the first round of the playoffs. The announcement looked imminent following the loss, and after a few days of speculation regarding the next HC candidate, a new name joined the race.\n\nAccording to Dave McMenamin, Mavs HC, Jason Kidd is a candidate to succeed Ham. On Sportscenter, McMenamin said, \"I expect the pendulum to swing back towards an experienced candidate this summer.\" The reporter added that Ty Lue, JJ Redick and Jason Kidd are \"the guys they're thinking about and pondering.\"\n\nAlong with Darvin Ham, his entire coaching staff has been fired as the Lakers look to start from scratch in their HC search. According to McMenamin, LeBron James and Anthony Davis will have a say in the selection process, and all three candidates have ties with LBJ. Jason Kidd played alongside a young LeBron for Team USA, and he could have a stake in the Lakers HC job if he guides the Mavs further than round 2.\n\nWhile the rumor mills are swinging, Jason Kidd is focused on the job at hand and that is to guide the Mavericks to a deep playoff run. On Friday, the Dallas side punched their ticket to the conference semifinals after beating the Clippers 114-101 and will meet the young guns of the OKC.\n\nAfter the game, Kidd talked to the press and revealed his message to the team. \"We just enjoy it. But I don't say much in front of the cameras. Once the cameras left, just enjoy it. We'll have tomorrow off, regroup on Sunday and then focus on Oklahoma City,\" said the 51-year-old.\n\nLuka Doncic and Co. have faced the OKC four times this season and only won once, which was a dominant 146-111 win in February. The Mavericks will travel to the Paycom center to open the series against the Thunder on May 7, and the Lakers front office will surely keep a keen eye on the proceedings.", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sami_haider@totalprosports.com", "name": "Sami Haider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1399488494-scaled-e1714811663921.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1843, "textEnd": 1848}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Washington and a starting lineup change by Kidd, the Mavericks went 16-2 and rose to the Western Conference's fifth seed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think it says that we have the right group of players; we have the right coaching staff; we have the right team surrounding this team,\" Harrison told The News three weeks ago.\n\nMoments later, Harrison spoke specifically of Kidd and the coaching staff and how they have built with and surrounding stars Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving.\n\nAfter Irving's Feb. 6 acquisition last season, the Mavericks went 5-11 during the sporadic games when both were on the court at the same time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEntering this second-round series against Oklahoma City, Dallas has won 23 of the last 29 games that Doncic and Irving have played together, including a 4-2 series victory over the Clippers in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The coaches have done a great job,\" Harrison said on April 11. \"One, when you have two superstar players, first and foremost, getting those guys to play together at a high level and respect each other's play and to play together, you always have to take a little bit off your game for the success of the team.\n\n\"To be able to do that is remarkable. Jason and his staff have done that at a high level. We're not successful if that doesn't happen.\"\n\nAs a player, Kidd was drafted No. 2 overall by the Mavericks in 1994. He was traded in December of 1996, but returned in 2008 and helped lead the franchise to its only NBA title in 2011.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf not under contract, Kidd would have been a natural candidate to succeed recently fired Darvin Ham as the Lakers' coach. Kidd was an assistant coach under Frank Vogel during the Lakers' 2020 championship season and has been close to LeBron James since they were 2008 USA basketball Olympic teammates.\n\n\"I have known Jason for a long time, and I cannot think of a better, more qualified candidate to lead this team going forward,\" Harrison said in Monday's news release. \"As a former NBA Champion Hall of Fame player, Jason brings a wealth of experience and expertise to this role which cannot be duplicated. He has earned the trust and respect of our players and that of so many across the league, and I look forward to working alongside him as we continue to build upon the culture and foundation of success

The 2023-24 Mavericks won 50 games in the regular season and finished in first place in the Southwest Division.\n\nIn a statement, Dallas Mavericks Governor Patrick Dumont said the franchise is excited to have Kidd on the bench.\n\n\"We are excited to have Coach Kidd continue to lead our team throughout the coming years with this well-earned contract extension.\" -Patrick Dumont\n\nDumont also stated the Mavericks \"are looking forward to his leadership in continuing to build and grow this already great franchise.\"\n\nWhat This Means for Dallas A stable voice in the locker room\n\nKidd took over at the start of the 2021 season, following the 13-year tenure of Rick Carlisle, and guided the Mavericks to a second-place finish in the Southwest Division. After nabbing a four-seed, the Mavericks topped the Utah Jazz in the first round. Then they took down top-seeded Phoenix in the Conference Semifinals before falling to eventual champion Golden State in five games.\n\nDuring the next season, Dallas swung a trade for Kyrie Irving to pair him with star Luka Don\u010di\u0107 . However, the experiment failed last year, as the team missed the playoffs. But the two have come together this year and led the Mavericks to a big turnaround. Dallas is able to keep the voice that has been trying to get the most out of Don\u010di\u0107 as the superstar continues to ascend his game. The Mavericks have Don\u010di\u0107 under contract for two more seasons guaranteed before a player option year in 2026.\n\nKeeping Kidd gives the Mavericks stability on the bench for a team playing up to its potential. It also allows the team to continue building up the roster around Don\u010di\u0107 to try and bring Dallas a championship for the first time since 2011. Clearly, something has clicked for the team this year, as Don\u010di\u0107 and Irving led the way, having built better chemistry this year. The team has gotten stronger play out of P.J. Washington and Dereck Lively II to aid the two guards this season.\n\nIt shouldn't be understated that the contract extension comes after rumors have swirled that the Los Angeles Lakers were interested in Kidd for their head coaching vacancy.\n\nWhat This Means for Kidd Staying at home\n\nDallas drafted Kidd out of Cal in 1994 as the second overall pick. He was the co-Rookie of the Year in 1995 and later came back for a second stint with the team, earning a title with that 2011 squad. Kidd started his head coaching career in Brooklyn before shifting to Milwaukee for three-plus seasons. He was fired midway through his fourth season there.\n\nNext season will be his fourth in Dallas. The extension most likely gives him his longest head coaching tenure thus far (although there have been crazier things to happen in the NBA.) As a Hall of Fame point guard in his own right, he has the chance to continue molding two of the best guards in the game in Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and Kyrie Irving. That's an enviable position for the Mavericks and Kidd. The Mavericks open up their series against the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder tomorrow.\n\nRelated Mike Conley To Take on Role of Timberwolves' Closer Mike Conley is ready and willing to take on the

Game 1 of that matchup is set for Tuesday night.\n\n\"I have known Jason for a long time, and I cannot think of a better, more qualified candidate to lead this team going forward,\" Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison stated in a press release. \"As a former NBA champion Hall of Fame player, Jason brings a wealth of experience and expertise to his role which cannot be duplicated. He has earned the trust and respect of our players and that of so many across the league, and I look forward to working alongside him as we continue to build upon the culture and foundation of success he's helped foster throughout his tenure as head coach.\"\n\nTerms of the contract were not disclosed, but the deal ends any speculation about Kidd's future in Dallas. ESPN's Dave McMenamin reported earlier this month that Kidd's name had come up in the Los Angeles Lakers' initial discussions about a replacement for Darvin Ham. Kidd previously worked for the Lakers as an assistant coach from 2019-2021.\n\nThe Mavericks are Kidd's third stop as a head coach, and he is 140-106 in three seasons since taking over. He has led the team to two playoff appearances, including a Western Conference Finals run in 2022. With the win over the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of this postseason, he is now 3-1 in playoff series with the Mavericks.\n\nKidd's ability to connect with the Mavericks' players, particularly Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, is a major reason why the Mavericks had so much success this season and the team is willing to commit to him long-term.\n\n\"I just know when I look at him, he has that understanding of high-level chess,\" Kyrie Irving said after the team eliminated the Clippers last week. \"When you have a coach like that, that reassures you, reinforces that you're doing the right things, it goes a long way. I definitely feel like we're on the same wavelength as well. We're just proving it every day and just continuing to put one foot in front of the other, taking it step by step.

He claimed after practice he was only joking when he said the local media wouldn't give him credit for making the Mavs better \"on and off the floor.\"\n\nEven if he was just kidding, it seemed out of character for a coach whose preternatural cool doesn't go over as well with the fan base as it apparently does with his players.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, my experience, based on a half-century behind a keyboard and a decade or so of herding teenagers, is when someone says they're just joking, it's only a half-truth, if that.\n\nThe whole truth is that, save for last year's debacle and a couple of horrific halves against the Clips, the first of which prompted yours truly to write he should be on a short leash, Kidd has come a long way as a head coach. The book on him in Brooklyn and Milwaukee, in particular, was that he was an old-school tyrant. Once made his Bucks cancel travel plans on Christmas Eve to run a boot camp practice. The bigger sin was wasting a Hall of Fame talent in Giannis Antetokounmpo. Three first-round flameouts in four years. Probably said all you needed to know that the first year after Kidd was gone the Bucks went to the Eastern Conference Finals. Two years later they won it all.\n\nThe rehabilitation of Kidd's coaching reputation started in Los Angeles as an assistant to Frank Vogel. As Kidd put it a couple years ago, a different vantage point on the bench helped him grow. He called it \"an opportunity to better your craft. Learning from Frank was great. He is always in a good mood, and he competes to win. He communicates with everyone. I've learned a lot over those two seasons.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLearned his lesson so well, in fact, ESPN reported recently that he was among the Lakers' leading candidates for Darvin Ham's old job. Which might explain the timing of Monday's news. No sense waiting to make an announcement if it only drives up the opposition's leverage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Kidd benefitted from the mentoring of his old boss, Vogel missed Kidd and Jared Dudley when they were gone. Both were valuable presences in the locker room and as intercessors with LeBron James and Anthony Davis.\n\nFans may prefer martinets, but getting along with superstars is a prerequisite for NBA coaches these days. Might be one of the reasons Rick Carlisle excused himself and packed up for Indianapolis. Kidd has the respect of both Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving, who offered his own affirmation after the Mavs closed out the Clippers when he said he wished Kidd had been his head coach years ago.\n\nOf course, the acclimatization of Irving in Dallas isn't as simple as that. His long-standing relationship with Nico Harrison, Kidd's boss, played a significant factor, as well. Like Kidd, Nico has grown into his role. I had my doubts at their bumpy introductory news conference. Nico seemed like too nice of a guy to be a GM. There's been trial and error - the seeds of the Jalen Brunson fiasco were planted before the Nico era - but a Western Conference finals run and the potential for another this year make a pretty good case for redemption.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis season's deadline trade changed the directory of the organization and raised expectations as a result. Which is why I went off on Kidd after Game 1. He couldn't finish the regular season with a bang, then go out with a whimper.\n\nAnyway, after getting schooled by Ty Lue in Game 1, Kidd responded by winning four of the next five games. The Mavs dominated the series, especially Games 5 and 6, imposing their will on the Clips. Lue's reputation as a bright coach who draws up a heck of a play coming out of a timeout remains despite the manner in which his team was dispatched. Might even be a candidate for the Lakers job himself.\n\nBut, bottom line, Kidd's team is still playing and Lue's isn't. Now Kidd will go head-coach-to-head-coach with another formidable foe in Mark Daigneault, who guided one of the league's youngest rosters to 57 wins and the top seed in the West.\n\nKidd won't have Maxi Kleber, a significant loss. But he still has Luka, Irving and a lob threat that clobbered the Thunder by 35 points back in February. He also has a new contract and the faith of the new owners. Let's hope he keeps earning it.\n\nAdvertisementRelated StoriesView MoreEven without Maxi Kleber, the Mavericks have a favorable matchup against OKC ThunderEverything to know about Mavericks-Thunder

The Lakers have been through six coaches in the 13 seasons since Phil Jackson left the team, who is next up for one of the premiere but toughest jobs in the league?\n\nNot Tyronn Lue or Jason Kidd. Or, at least, it's highly unlikely, despite their names popping up in rumors.\n\nThe reason is simple: Both are under contract for one more year with their respective teams and are not about to be fired, which is something Marc Stein wrote about in his newsletter. In fact, both the Clippers and Mavericks are looking to extend their coach beyond this year.\n\n\"Like I said, I want to be here. Hopefully, we're able to solidify that...\" Lue said when asked about the Lakers rumors following the Clippers' elimination from the playoffs by Kidd's Mavericks. \"I didn't come in to bounce around, go all over the place. [Clippers owner, management] all been great to me. Just having a great relationship with the owner, with the front office. It's great. I would love to be here longterm.\"\n\nKidd is expected to be offered and sign a contract extension to stay in Dallas with Luka Doncic and a contending team, Stein reported.\n\nEven if one of those coaches went to their respective teams and said they wanted to walk away -- which, to be clear, neither has done, this is just a hypothetical -- the Clippers and Mavericks will still have the coach under contract and would not let him walk out the door to a conference rival. In theory, the Lakers could try to trade for one of those coaches, but even if the Clippers/Mavericks didn't hang up on the call, the price would be a couple of first-round picks. In the case of the Lakers, they need those picks more to retool the talent around LeBron James and Anthony Davis than land a coach.\n\nWhat Lue and Kidd have in common is ties to LeBron, who is expected to opt out of the $51.4 million final year of his contract with Los Angeles. The Lakers desperately want to keep him -- and most around the league expect he will re-sign in Los Angeles -- and part of that is bringing in a coach he wants. Knowing that, it's not a surprise that the names were at least leaked -- it's a sign the Lakers are looking and trying, even if the results are unrealistic.\n\nOther names mentioned as possible Lakers coaches include former NBA head coaches Mike Budenholzer -- who won a championship with the Bucks -- and Kenny Atkinson. There certainly will be others.\n\nJust don't expect a team to hand their star coach over to the Lakers.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyronn_Lue", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyronn Lue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Atkinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e7f1442/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4928x2772+0+254/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2b%2F4d%2F3039b87d4b0397b6cce430f57561%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1759149709", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

While Lue is at least in the final year of his current contract, securing either candidate appears to be a long shot for the Lakers.\n\nThey are aware of this challenge, though. In his latest Substack newsletter, veteran NBA journalist Marc Stein reported updates on Kidd and noted that the Lakers do not expect either him or Lue to be attainable.\n\n\"League sources say Kidd is also the likely recipient of a contract extension in the near future, having led Dallas to two 50-win seasons and three playoff series wins in four attempts in his three seasons as Mavericks coach.\n\nStein continued:\n\n\"I'm told that the Lakers, for their part, don't anticipate Kidd becoming a coaching free agent any more than they expect to have a shot at Lue\".\n\nIt's far from certain that Lue or Kidd will be the Lakers coach next season, and their chances seem slimmer than ever. They were already considered long shots, to begin with.\n\nThe Lakers may need to shift their strategy towards other mentioned candidates, including assistants, former coaches, or even those outside these categories -- like JJ Redick, for example, as it appears unlikely that they will secure a marquee hire during this search.\n\nTy Lue wants to remain with LA Clippers than move to LA Lakers\n\nThe brief period of speculation about Ty Lue becoming the next Lakers coach has come to an end.\n\nFollowing the Clippers' first-round exit to the Mavericks in Game 6 on Friday, Lue addressed the media postgame and firmly dismissed the rumors connecting him to the hallway rivals.\n\nLue expressed his desire to stay with the Clippers and indicated that he has no interest in switching teams.\n\nSecuring Lue was always considered highly unlikely.

The development comes amidst the team achieving a 50-win season, a first-round playoff series victory against the LA Clippers, and a run to the Western Conference Finals in 2022 -- his first season as head coach in Dallas.\n\nAs NBA Insider Marc Stein recently noted, Kidd's presence has been a crucial factor in the team's success, enabling Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving to form one of the league's most potent partnerships. Stein described the outlook of an extension as \"likely\" in a recent report.\n\n\"The Mavericks' success this season is a testament to Kidd's ability to motivate and strategize,\" said a team source, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"He's been instrumental in developing our young players and getting the most out of our veteran leaders. We're excited to keep him at the helm for years to come.\"\n\nKidd has fostered a close relationship with his superstar players, Doncic and Irving, which has been a key factor in the team's success. Having such a connection with top players tends to take a coach far, as it allows for a level of trust and understanding essential for achieving greatness.\n\nIrving praised Kidd before the 2023-24 season, saying, \"Life after basketball is important, but we want to enjoy what we're doing here every single day, and (Kidd) just brings a natural ease. His energy is easygoing. He's going to hold you accountable and he's brutally honest, which I appreciate. He's got to be your guy to have that loyalty.\"\n\nKidd's ability to connect with his players -- not just superstars -- and get the most out of his team has been a hallmark of his coaching style. Given his reputation from his Hall of Fame playing days, he commands natural respect from players trying to learn and improve their game, with his 2011 championship run with the Mavericks being all the more reason for a player to be receptive his insight.\n\nThe Mavericks will face the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Semifinals with Game 1 being played on Tuesday at Paycom Center.

Entering Friday's game against the Washington Wizards, the Mavericks, since New Year's Day, had been right behind the Boston Celtics in defense. Dallas ranked first in opponent 3-point percentage allowed and number of 3s made, second in defensive rating and seventh in opponent free-throw attempts. And that was despite the Mavericks having only one player, Maxi Kleber, in the top 90-plus players leaguewide in FiveThirtyEight's defensive RAPTOR ratings.\n\nBut Kidd and his staff have created a connected defensive unit this season, building on what Rick Carlisle had produced in 13 seasons in Dallas. And Kidd, in his third stint as head coach after one tumultuous season in Brooklyn and three-plus years in Milwaukee with a young Giannis Antetokounmpo, seems to coach much differently. There seems to be a calmness in the 49-year-old that wasn't there at the start of his coaching career. There are times when he gets on his team, of course; it's part of the job. But Kidd is selective these days.\n\nKidd and first-year general manager Nico Harrison put together an eclectic coaching staff, bringing former Phoenix Suns coach Igor Koko\u0161kov over from the Turkish Super League power Fenerbah\u00e7e (\"no one leaves Fenerbah\u00e7e,\" an admiring rival team executive said). Kidd also brought over Greg St. Jean from the Los Angeles Lakers, where Kidd served as assistant coach for two seasons under Frank Vogel, including the Lakers' 2020 championship team in the bubble.\n\nSean Sweeney, who was on Dwane Casey's staff in Detroit's last season, was Kidd's defensive Yoda in Milwaukee; his moniker of \"Little Thibodeau,\" as one member of the staff put it, is well earned. Kristi Toliver has balanced playing in the WNBA with working on NBA benches for the last several seasons. Jared Dudley, who finished his playing days in L.A. while Kidd was there, jumped into coaching with Kidd rather than looking for another playing gig. And Kidd and Harrison kept holdovers Darrell Armstrong, God Shammgod (who stayed in Dallas rather than join former Mavs assistant Jamahl Mosley, who now is head coach of the Orlando Magic) and Peter Patton from Carlisle's staff. It's an intriguing mix of different styles, experiences and strengths.\n\nAnd then, of course, the Mavericks gave up 135 points to the lowly Wizards, and Kidd got tossed in the third quarter by referee Tony Brothers.\n\nMy fault.\n\nI brought bad defense juju with me. These occurrences have to happen organically; when you call attention to them, they go away. Such are the whims of the basketball gods.\n\nBut the Mavs were right back to their old, quality, defensive selves in a big road win Sunday in Milwaukee. At any rate, Kidd spoke with The Athletic this weekend about putting his staff together, bringing traded players into the flow at the deadline, how the Mavs have used Luka Don\u010di\u0107 differently this season on defense and other topics.\n\n(Editor's note: This conversation has been edited for both length and clarity.)\n\nHow has the staff come together over the year?\n\nWhen you look at Sweeney and Sham, I had worked with those dudes ...\n\nI figured Sweeney was non-negotiable.\n\nYeah, he's a must. To be able to get him from Detroit was great. I had worked with Saint in L.A. the last two years. Just being around him and his basketball mind, and then also knowing his dad (former Kings and Warriors coach Garry St. Jean) being in the Bay Area. Then with Igor, when we talked about it in the summer, he has a relationship with Luka; he's been with Luka. And he's been here for a long, long time. Started in Missouri (where Koko\u0161kov, in 1999, became the first European to hold that position in NCAA Division I men's basketball), been around different teams. He was a great get for us.\n\nThe biggest thing is I learned from Frank: Frank's staff is kind of formed. He worked with all of us and had a good time, and we won a championship. You don't always have to know the person; you can get to know the person. We got Duds kind of late. I thought he would still be playing. But when it went in a different direction, I asked him what he wanted to do, and he said, \"I'd like to get started in coaching.\" I thought coaching (for him), once we heard L.A. was going in a different direction. We had a former player, and then we have players. KT is still playing, and everybody raved about her when she was here in D.C., so I thought that would be another great get on the staff. And then Sham and DA were already here, so we kept them. Peter is listed as a shooting coach, but we call him just coach.\n\nWith so many coaching mouths to feed, how did you approach division of labor and time?\n\nWe tried to make a pod system. Everyone's in a pod; we have three pods, so there's not just one coach or two coaches doing the work. Everyone has work to do, and they're playing their role, just like the players. That's been a big thing. It's not just one person doing all of the offense and one person doing the defense. Each one has their scouts, and they're able to come up with the game plan, and we go from there. When you look at pods, when we put the schedule up, Pod 1 is Igor. He has the Washington scout. So, they come up with the game plan. They present it; we'll change a couple of things here and there. But they'll present the video; they'll present the walkthrough so that Sean isn't doing all 82 games.\n\nThe notion of playing Luka at the low man, how did that evolve?\n\nWe talk about playing behind the defense and not seeing the same pitch over and over. Good teams, when you get to the next (playoff) level, they're going to catch that pitch. So we started showing him different places for him on the floor we'd like him to try. As you know, he has to be willing to say OK. He said OK, and we went from there. He said, \"Yeah, let's try it,\" and he said it's all right. So, we started slowly building different things out of those situations.\n\nYou said all he has to do is \"participate\" defensively. Knowing his burden at the other end, what does defensive \"participation\" for him mean to you?\n\nJust like he participates on the offensive end. We're not asking him to be the defensive stopper, but he's taking pride in trying to play defense. Not comparing him to Dirk (Nowitzki), but he participated. We're not built on one-on-one defense. It's a team concept, both sides. He knows he has help behind him. That's why we said \"participate,\" because the help behind you will help you -- if you participate.\n\nWhen you got to the trade deadline and you suspected the team will be active, how did that impact your season-long approach to building your defensive habits?\n\nPlayers, a lot of times, want a system as much as they say they want freedom, because you need some guidelines in case they leave. And that's what we have. You bring in two players, or one player -- shoot, with COVID, you're bringing in five to seven more new players. But if there's a system, it's real easy. There's no gray. And that's what we have.\n\nHow have you evolved since Milwaukee?\n\nOne, it's a different situation. We were taking Milwaukee as a layover city. They'd won 13 games (the year before). It was a build, building from the ground up. So you had to, maybe, be a little harder because we had so many bad habits. So, we changed it. But they had good habits here, and they had a little more talent than, maybe, they had in Milwaukee at the time. But, defensively, it's the same thing. You start with defense. We're No. 2 in defense (going into last Friday's game). Milwaukee, it was all about 2s -- how can you protect the paint? Now, it's about how do you defend the 3-pointer? So, you make adjustments. That's the thing about evolving. We had to address style, approach. It's a different time.\n\nDid you pick up anything in particular from your time in L.A.?\n\nFrank's communication with his players. His, I guess, non-negotiables, like defense. That's what wins. As much as we talk about the 3, championships are won by defense. Paying attention to that. But also, Frank's a great human being. He's a great coach. The small things. There was ... this is different in a lot of ways. I have one key, and that's to be the coach. That's it. In Milwaukee, I had all the keys, trying to help all the departments. And you're going to burn yourself out. But the last few years, I got to see a great coach, and great players in AD (Anthony Davis) and LeBron (James).\n\nWith your young guys, have you reached the \"Google me\" stage, or do you still bring them out here and do work?\n\nOh, no. You talk about it. My job is to help. When I see Luka, Spencer (Dinwiddie), J.B. (Jalen Brunson), the other players, Maxi, Dorian (Finney-Smith), it's like, \"Dorian, I want you to put the ball on the floor. I want you to be a playmaker. You're not just a catch-and-shoot, or a 3-and-D.\" It's basketball. Sometimes we get labeled when actually you can do more -- which, if you do more, will help the team.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_aldridge@theathletic.com", "name": "David Aldridge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Koko\u0161kov", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Igor Koko\u0161kov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenerbah\u00e7e_S.K._(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.

Irving praised Kidd before the 2023-24 season, saying, \"Life after basketball is important, but we want to enjoy what we're doing here every single day, and (Kidd) just brings a natural ease. His energy is easygoing. He's going to hold you accountable and he's brutally honest, which I appreciate. He's got to be your guy to have that loyalty.\"\n\nKidd's ability to connect with players and get the most out of his team has been a hallmark of his coaching style. His reputation from his Hall of Fame playing days commands natural respect from players, and his 2011 championship run with the Mavericks has earned him credibility. Additionally, he entered his position with Harrison and holds a close relationship with him, too.\n\nThe Mavericks face the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Semifinals, with Game 1 on Tuesday at Paycom Center.

With Irving, we don't see what was written in the past, only what happens now. He is rewriting his journey. Before, no one thought he would fit with Luka,\" Kidd remarked.\n\nThis approach has silenced doubts about Irving's fit with the team, leading to a harmonious and effective partnership on the court.\n\nIn the second round, the Mavericks are set to face the regular season Western Conference champions, the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nWith Kidd's renewed mandate, he aims to continue proving his worth as the right leader for one of the NBA's most scrutinized coaching positions.\n\nDallas now looks forward with a clear direction and a strategic guide for the future, aptly supported by their dynamic duo, whom Kidd likened to 'Batman and Robin'.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Cuban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/6cb3441f846632e334bfaf7d56c55dc9/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/06/17150011768507.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539902", "eventUri": "eng-9539902", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Instead, the team tanked at the end of the regular season to try to preserve a draft pick, even when there were still mathematical hopes of qualifying for the play-in tournament.\n\nKidd was the front man for all the tough questions in the final days of the regular season, and got a vote of confidence from then-owner Mark Cuban. Dallas kept the draft pick, and first-rounder Dereck Lively II had a significant impact as a rookie center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Last year, we learned a lot about character, about the team,\" Kidd said. \"At the time, everyone had their opinion. But understanding what the plan is internally, I thought we executed the plan. Being calm and not losing your mind or being offended of what others say turned out to be the right thing.\"\n\nIrving re-signed with Dallas, and after Cuban sold his majority stake to the casino-linked families of Patrick Dumont and Miriam Adelson, a late-season surge lifted the Mavs to fifth in the West at 52-30.\n\nThe extension for Kidd comes after his name surfaced in reports of the Lakers' coaching search. Los Angeles fired Darvin Ham last week.\n\nTerms of the deal weren't released. Doncic and Irving are under team control together for one more season. Irving has a player option in his contract for 2025-26, Doncic the following season.\n\n76ERS: Say goodbye to the 76ers.\n\nNo, not Joel Embiid. Tyrese Maxey is sticking around, too. Nick Nurse seems like a perfect long-term fit as coach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut for the rest of the Sixers? It's time to pretty much wish them well, with just about the entire team - players such as Kelly Oubre Jr., Kyle Lowry and Nic Batum - ending the season with an expired contract.\n\nTeam President Daryl Morey this summer has about $65 million in salary cap space, a first-round draft pick, a max contract to offer to Maxey and plenty of questions to solve on how to finally, truly build an NBA championship contender around Embiid.\n\n\"We're not going to have continuity,\" Morey said at the 76ers' headquarters in New Jersey. \"We'll have continuity with our stars and our head coach but we're going to have a lot of changes this season.\"\n\nThe Sixers first-round exit against the Knicks made it 41 years since their last NBA championship. The Sixers haven't even advanced out of the second round since 2001. It's time to start over - this time with a championship chase, not a \"Process.\"\n\n\"We're focused on Joel and Tyrese and we're focused on now,\" Morey said.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

I asked for questions about the Mavericks' offseason and, really, anything else on our website and Twitter this week. I'm answering them in a two-part installment. This is the first, and the second will run early next week.\n\nI'm going to focus more on specific offseason scenarios in next week's article -- that was by far the most popular type of question, and understandably so! -- but you can still submit any type of questions here! Note that I've lightly condensed and edited some of the questions for readability.\n\n@flinchfontana asks, \"What is your prediction for which 2022-23 Mavs roster members are on the roster in Game 1 of the 2023-24 season?\"\n\nThis is a prediction I'm making purely off gut feelings:\n\nLuka Don\u010di\u0107, Kyrie Irving, Josh Green, Jaden Hardy, Reggie Bullock, Maxi Kleber, JaVale McGee, Dwight Powell.\n\nMicah N. asks, \"Do you think the best approach might be the most boring approach? Draft a player wherever the pick falls, sign one-to-two undrafted guys with upside, bet on internal improvement and a summer of Luka/Kyrie gelling, and signing a big/wing with (the midlevel exception). Every trade I see mocked up involves swapping two pieces plus assets for one player. The Mavs can't keep doing these two-for-ones when we have zero depth to begin with.\"\n\nYou know, there's a lot of sense to this argument, and it's pretty close to the team-building approach I've long thought the Mavericks should have taken over the past few years. But I think that the Mavericks' problem isn't depth as much as it is an absence of starting-level players. They have enough players who would work if they receive the sixth-, seventh- or eighth-most minutes on a team. It might take a two-for-one or three-for-one deal to get closer to the type of player who would be considered the Mavericks' third-best player. If Irving re-signs, the team's salary sheet also becomes more important -- especially given the harsher penalties in the league's new collective bargaining agreement -- and getting off these bloated contracts might be more of a priority than this strategy would allow.\n\nI'll have a little bit more to say about this when answering questions in next week's article.\n\nCameron S. asks, \"How short of a leash on Kidd next season?\"\n\nI don't believe the team's decision makers have any uncertainty about Kidd continuing, right now, as the team's head coach. It's not that he has a short or long leash, but that the team -- most specifically, Mark Cuban -- doesn't view him in that perspective at all.\n\nThat isn't to say the team believes Kidd's coaching last season was without fault. We could all, of course, see that he made mistakes. But what Kidd did his first season with the team far outweighs this past season, which was flawed by the roster construction to the extent that even flawless coaching couldn't have completely salvaged it. I do believe that, even if I also believe -- and have written before -- that Kidd's coaching did not help this team win the margins that decide games.\n\nBut let's stay on that topic with ...\n\nHamza O. asks, \"What are Jason Kidd's strengths as a coach -- it can't be rotations or press conferences.\"\n\nI believe Kidd was hired, more than anything else, to get the most out of Luka Don\u010di\u0107.\n\nDon\u010di\u0107 never forgave Rick Carlisle for the manner in which he treated his teammates, specifically Dennis Smith Jr., in Don\u010di\u0107's rookie year -- something meticulously detailed by ESPN's Tim MacMahon in 2021. His fraught feelings toward his previous head coach led to Carlisle's departure and Kidd's hiring, and Kidd has successfully built a strong relationship with the franchise's superstar in the past two seasons.\n\nHowever, that relationship hasn't yet led to Don\u010di\u0107 improving in the ways he must. We all saw Don\u010di\u0107 continue to be his own worst enemy with his petulant attitude toward officiating and his defensive effort, and his continued struggles to maintain the incredibly high conditioning standards needed for a player who averaged the fifth-most touches in the league during the regular season.\n\nIt might be that there isn't any coach alive who could have convinced or coaxed Don\u010di\u0107 into better habits this past season. It has to start with his desire to change. And if Don\u010di\u0107 does that this summer, it might be that the mutual respect he and Kidd have for each other can strengthen or amplify what Don\u010di\u0107 is trying to do.\n\nBut Kidd, of course, is the head coach of this entire team. The genuine locker room belief he built in his first season probably helped the team's on-court play in abstract, undefinable ways. It wasn't as strong this past season, but what frustrations existed were not pointed at him. What he said in press conferences, as frustrating as some of the quotes were to fans, weren't things that bothered the players. (I had a long conversation about Kidd's press conference quotes and the extent to which they matter on my podcast, 77 Minutes, in March.) Kidd's ability to create belief and trust in players benefitted Josh Green and Jaden Hardy.\n\nKidd didn't show much adaptability last season, and he too often coached like this team was the same conference finalist from two years ago. The best coaches transform to the rosters they're tasked with coaching, but it might be that Kidd could impress just as much as he did his rookie season if the right pieces are put back in place for him to use. That said, these first two seasons in Dallas have obvious similarities to his first two with the Milwaukee Bucks. It's not destined that Kidd must repeat that same cycle, but the team's belief in him will look awfully foolish -- and exceedingly avoidable -- if it does.\n\nRagan R. asks, \"Do you feel there is any point where Mark Cuban decides to take a step back and is not as involved with the roster build and day-to-day operations of the team?\"\n\nMy best understanding is that Cuban has not been as involved in the day-to-day operations of Nico Harrison's front office and Kidd's coaching staff as compared to past regimes. That said, Harrison and Kidd were hires that reflected Cuban's vision for his franchise. They were two figures lauded for the relationships they had with this league's stars, which aligns with what we know about Cuban's team-building beliefs.\n\nWhat I think you're really asking is whether this franchise could ever have decision makers who are empowered to choose this team's big-picture direction regardless if Cuban agrees. I don't know, but I don't think it's happened yet.\n\nPhillip B. asks, \"How are you spending the offseason? Any books, TV shows, games you're looking forward to?\"\n\nI just finished John Steinbeck's \"East of Eden,\" and I'm going to read \"The Grapes of Wrath\" as well. I'm working through Neil Postman's \"Amusing Ourselves to Death,\" but I've found the first couple chapters to be incredibly poignant media criticism even though the book was published in 1985. For a lighter non-fiction, I have Anthony Bourdain's \"Kitchen Confidential\" queued up. And while I found it difficult to read books about sports while the season was ongoing, I just put Mike Prada's \"Spaced Out\" next to my reading chair. Sorry, Mike, but I'm finally getting to it! He's my editor, but I promise he had nothing to do with this shoutout. (Editor's Note: About time, but thank you!)\n\nAs for television, I watched Netflix's \"Beef\" and Apple TV's \"Severance\" over the past month and really enjoyed them both. Is this the summer I finally commit to watching \"Twin Peaks\"? I guess we'll see.\n\nI'm a very boring gamer. I really only play online FIFA matches even while constantly complaining about how broken that game is.\n\n@mason744 asks, \"Why aren't you a fan anymore?\"\n\nThis is a question that I think sports writers like to answer far more than sports reader like to read it -- especially ones like me who started at fan blogs -- but it's really just the natural process of turning a beloved hobby into a professional obligation. I don't view that as a good thing or a bad thing, but just a thing that happens. I've found the joy of fandom in soccer over the past few years, specifically Borussia Dortmund and the U.S. men's national team. But I wouldn't ever want to write about them, certainly not on a full-time basis, because it's likely that the same thing would happen.\n\nOne of my favorite stories I've ever written at The Athletic was the column I wrote after Dirk Nowitzki's retirement.

Credit Jason Kidd", "body": "SALT LAKE CITY -- With 26 seconds remaining in Game 3 and the Dallas Mavericks needing to close out an eight-point lead over the Utah Jazz, Jason Kidd made what might have seemed like this series' strangest substitution. With that little time left, most coaches trust the players who brought them there. They might put in a knockdown free-throw shooter to anticipate late-game fouling; it made sense when Davis Bertans walked to the scorer's table to check in.\n\nBut it made less sense, at least on the surface, when Trey Burke checked into the game alongside Bertans. The backup guard had been forced into action for Game 2, with Luka Doncic still not playing in this series, despite playing just four of the team's final 11 games. And was that really Sterling Brown, coming in for his first minutes of the series? He had played even less in the regular season's closing; appearing just once in the final nine games. These were the closing seconds of an eventual 126-118 win that put Dallas up, 2-1, in its first-round series. It wasn't quite time for victory cigars. Yet, here they came.\n\n\"I trust everyone, everyone that puts on a uniform,\" Kidd explained afterward. \"With the rotation being shorter, I felt coming down the stretch there was no better time to get some guys in, to see how they react; the game isn't over, and those guys were prepared.\"\n\nTo understand Kidd's decisions is to understand his entire ethos as a head coach this season. Since the moment Kidd first arrived in Dallas, there's been nothing he has preached more than trust and belief on an organizational scale. During training camp, he introduced us to a concept of a leadership council, which was made up of the team's three most influential players at the time. In the season's second game, he used all 15 players within the first three quarters. Throughout the year, he has treated games as experimental laboratories to prepare for the postseason. But he also has reaffirmed and instilled his belief throughout this roster.\n\n\"Everything (Kidd) has done has been predicated off that,\" Jalen Brunson said afterward. \"Everything we do, everything we don't do, basically comes back to our chemistry and our accountability and making sure we're all on the same page. We're all clicking, we're all talking, we're all communicating.\"\n\nHow can you watch Dallas' past two wins and not see that resonate throughout every aspect of those victories? It's the defensive buy-in from every player, which has smothered the league's second-best 3-point shooting team into averaging just 26 attempts per game, fewer than any team averaged in the regular season. It's Brunson, who fell out of the postseason rotation under last season's coaching staff, scoring 72 points with only a single turnover the past two games. It's the 3-point explosions from two players that Utah dared to shoot: Maxi Kleber hitting 13 of his 17 shots the past two games after knocking down just 18.8 percent after the All-Star break, and Josh Green nailing three of his five looks on Thursday, a new career-high for made 3s in any NBA game.\n\n\"It's always good to have coaches talking to you, (saying), 'Shoot it every time. Every time you're open, shoot it,'\" Green said. \"It's vice versa, too. We really trust what the coaches are telling us, and the coaches' gameplan.\"\n\nLook, I questioned the Kidd hiring, pointing out doubts about the team's process and his past that I still believe were legitimate ones to have been asked at that time. I still believe results and processes aren't always aligned. But it's been made incredibly clear this season that whoever Kidd was as a head coach years ago is not the person manning the sidelines today. That the team's full-throttled success, which can so easily be contrasted with what we saw last season, does come from the players believing and trusting this coaching staff without reservation. They can do that because they're reflecting what's been shown to them, from the very first moment this season started.\n\n\"You can ask (the players) that question, because it's about them,\" Kidd said when I asked him about this afterward. \"It's not about the coaches. We're here just to try to help.\"\n\nBut having seen what happens when a coaching staff isn't helping a roster, it's abundantly clear that whatever Kidd and his staff have done has unlocked belief and buy-in from these players that hadn't previously been seen. That maybe even they didn't even know was possible. And that has led Dallas to a 2-1 lead in this first-round series that seems, right now, almost insurmountable for the Jazz to overcome.\n\nThere's so much more to say, and nothing at all. It feels important to examine the strategic wrinkles that have allowed Dallas to win its past two games, and also silly, because I do not believe any longer in this Jazz team's ability to adjust further. I do not reckon there's anything they can do to avoid losing this series in fewer than six games without something unseen dramatically changing it. Who cares how the Jazz temporarily adjusted with Eric Paschall at center when that won't win them more than another game? It matters, but it doesn't. It's not even that the Jazz are some much less talented team. They've been figured out and are seemingly sick of this workplace; they might as well be complaining after every team meeting that it really could've just been an email.\n\nIt's this math equation that has them beat so soundly: Dallas, this postseason, has attempted more 3s than any other team, and Utah has attempted the second-fewest. The first half featured more disorganized rotations and defensive breakdowns than we saw in the first two games, and the Mavericks capitalized by nailing a bunch more uncontested 3s. Rudy Gobert helped too often because he's shellshocked, knowing his perimeter teammates can't even slow down the opposing guards for seconds. Brunson left the game due to Royce O'Neale's tomfoolery, and Dallas extended its lead anyway. Without Spencer Dinwiddie's struggles and Dwight Powell's ineffectiveness, Dallas would have blown this game away when the third quarter began. Instead, they only prolonged Utah's suffering.\n\nThe Jazz were successful in the third quarter due to Paschall's positioning much more than his actual shooting threat. In truth, Paschall receiving an extended run in the coming games might lead to Dallas treating him just like Utah has Kleber and Green. He's a good 3-point shooter but not at a high volume, and you'd bet he wouldn't even take that many, much less make them. But Paschall being a nominal spot-up shooter meant there wasn't a big man clogging the lane for the first time this series, and suddenly Utah's high-difficulty floaters turned into dunks and layups that were much more convertible. Dallas still ran the shooters off the line. It's just that, for the first time in three games, they had somewhere they could actually reach when they drove.\n\nBut even understanding Dallas might be due for a worse shooting night soon -- the team's 40 made 3s these past two games are the most in any single two-game stretch in franchise history -- it's still that math that could buoy them past any version of Utah that proves somewhat more competent on the offensive end. It's just what seems most likely. If there are concerns, they come more from Reggie Bullock and Dorian Finney-Smith's extreme minute totals through these opening three games. (I chatted with Bullock at shootaround before Thursday's game, and while he's not concerned about the minute totals, he admitted that he's definitely felt them add up.) It's defensive slippage that would be most damning for the Mavericks, but it just seems unlikely that would happen.\n\nFor as many adjustments as Utah made, it was the Mavericks who still arguably had more success with their own, such as using Josh Green for designated handoffs or a nifty off-ball screening action where Davis Bertans cleared room for two Bullock corner 3s. Josh Bowe also picked up on that play, and he aptly headlined his post-game article, \"The Mavericks have all the answers.\" It really feels like they do, and if they don't, they will, and if they can't, they'll find another path forward. That's the belief in themselves that truly has been this team's ethos all season. It's not going to change now.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_cato@theathletic.com", "name": "Tim Cato", "type": "author",

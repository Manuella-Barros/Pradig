This time, it was none other than New York Knicks guard Jalen Brunson, who is able to generate WWE-level pops at the Garden and managed to get one when he showed up on camera. As it turns out, people at Madison Square Garden like the best player on the Knicks! Anyway, fast-forward to a little later in the evening, when Logan Paul participated in a men\u2019s Money in the Bank ladder match against LA Knight and Santos Escobar. In one of the better examples of knowing your audience to get heat I\u2019ve ever seen, Paul was joined by Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton, who went up to Brunson and stared him down. Towards the end of the match, Paul instructed Haliburton to go grab brass knuckles for him, only Brunson decided to intervene and distract Haliburton from handing them off. This opened up a window for Escobar to take out Paul, and in the ensuing chaos, LA Knight was able to pin Paul and earn a spot in the ladder match. Well, Paul did not take this especially well, so he and Haliburton (who was still wearing the brass knuckles) tried to corner LA Knight. Brunson was able to make the save once again, this time after grabbing a steel chair to fend them off. Adam Silver I hope you are watching this and give a Hali vs. Brunson steel cage match at SummerSlam your full blessing.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jb.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=440&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"jalen brunson tyrese haliburton smackdown\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jb.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jb.jpg?resize=300,129 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jb.jpg?resize=704,303 704w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jb.jpg?resize=768,330 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">WWE</span></figcaption>\t</figure>\n\tGame 8 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals between the Knicks and the Pacers took place on Friday night in the squared circle.", "url": "https://uproxx.com/dimemag/tyrese-haliburton-jalen-brunson-wwe-smackdown-video/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jb2.jpg?w=710", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:23:47", "author": "Bill DiFilippo", "authors": ["Bill DiFilippo"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.158}

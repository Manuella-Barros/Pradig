{"id": 223735576, "title": "Mass. teens named co-valedictorians at New York school", "text": "Identical twins from Southborough, Massachusetts, now have more in common than just their DNA, college, sport of choice and major (which might seem impossible). Chloe and Olivia Chiota graduated from Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, on May 19 as co-valedictorians for the class of 2024. They also both played lacrosse and majored in biology in their undergraduate education. \u201cI asked if it was her. And they wouldn\u2019t tell me, so I just went over to her phone and was watching it and was hoping that she would get a call, and she did, so it was really exciting,\u201d Chloe told WKTV. This is the second time that the university has named co-valedictorians, according to People magazine, but a first that the two people sharing the spotlight are related. \u201cIt was nice for my parents to not have to clap for one person, feel a little bad for the other,\u201d said Olivia to NBC10 Boston. The twins, although they both plan to take a gap year and pursue dental school following that year, have different minors from the school with Chloe minoring in sociology and Olivia in women\u2019s and gender studies. Their home in Massachusetts is also not far from their minds. \u201cFor the rest of the year, we\u2019re looking to work in a dental office to gain clinical experience potentially as dental assistants close to home in [Massachusetts],\u201d Chloe told the media.", "summary": "<p>\u201cIt was nice for my parents to not have to clap for one person, feel a little bad for the other.\u201d </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/26/mass-teens-named-co-valedictorians-at-new-york-school/\">Mass. teens named co-valedictorians at New York school</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/26/mass-teens-named-co-valedictorians-at-new-york-school/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/BDC_Logo_2020_256x256-60d0abc34135e.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:17:54", "author": "Rosemary Ford", "authors": ["Rosemary Ford"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.364}

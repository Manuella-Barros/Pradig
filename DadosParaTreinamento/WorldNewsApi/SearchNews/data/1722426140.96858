President Vladimir V. Putin has been scaling a pyramid of nuclear escalation, but it remains unclear whether this process will end with Russia\u2019s explosion of a powerful warhead in low Earth orbit, says Spenser Warren, a scholar on Russia\u2019s nuclear modernisation drive under Putin\u2019s reign at the University of California Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation. \u201cRussian nuclear threats reached peaks at several points,\u201d Warren told me in an interview, including its recent virtual detonations of tactical bombs on a mock Ukrainian battlefield, its suspension of the U.S.-Russian New START arms control treaty, and now its race to perfect an orbital bomb to shake up the heavens. Hypothetically, the White House could opt to respond to Russia\u2019s lofting a nuclear-tipped spacecraft by shooting it down with an anti-satellite missile as an act of self-defense, says Dr. Laura Grego, a preeminent expert on nuclear weapons, missile defense, and space security at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Russia\u2019s War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine \u201cOne can use a conventionally armed interceptor of the type the U.S. and others have developed to destroy the nuclear weapon,\u201d she told me. But that mission would be extremely high risk, she warns. \u201cRussia could preemptively detonate the nuclear weapon if it saw the interceptor launch and suspected where it was headed,\u201d she says. As a co-drafter of the Outer Space Treaty, Russia is obligated never to send a nuclear bomb into orbit, she points out. \u201cThe best place to verify compliance with the obligation not to station nuclear weapons in space is before launch.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very much harder once such a weapon is launched.\u201d But Russia has suspended nuclear inspections required under the New START Treaty, and is certain to balk at any U.S. or UN request to visit its nuclear weapons centers to find the orbit-bound bomb. \u201cThere may be contextual clues about whether a satellite is actually carrying a nuclear weapon,\u201d Dr. Grego says, \u201cbut I expect that there are pretty good techniques for disguising it as something else, at least for a while.\u201d Russian rockets take center stage in central Moscow.

[+] brinkmanship with a nuclear-tipped spacecraft to perpetually patrol the planet (Photo by NATALIA KOLESNIKOVA/AFP via Getty Images) AFP via Getty Images \u201cBack when we had civil engagement with Russia, there was a general consensus not to put nuclear weapons in space,\u201d says John Hamre, a former deputy secretary of defense who is now President and CEO of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, one of the top defense think tanks in Washington DC. But Russia might now be abandoning that space d\u00e9tente, he told me in an interview. During a fascinating CSIS fireside chat that Dr. Hamre hosted, \"The Nuclear Option: Deciphering Russia's New Space Threat,\u201d he stated: \u201cThis is an implication there\u2019s now a weapon in orbit or could be a weapon in orbit and that's a very profound thing. Nuclear weapons in space are really profoundly different from nuclear weapons here on planet Earth.\u201d \"We're used to thinking about blast effects and there's the shock wave and all that sort of thing. All of that is the product of an Earthly environment,\u201d he added. In an interview right after that gathering, Dr. Hamre told me: \u201cMuch of the destructive quality of nuclear weapons on Earth comes from the heat (the detonation heating air molecules) and blast effects (the air compression that is pushed violently through the atmosphere). Some energy from the blast is consumed by impact on the ground, generating ejecta. You have none of that in space. So almost all the energy is dissipated as x-rays.\u201d \u201cA nuclear detonation in space,\u201d he says, \u201cwould reach out hundreds of miles.\u201d Even during the ultimate arms contest that marked Cold War I, when Moscow and Washington competed to test thermonuclear bombs that could set entire continents afire, the two sides agreed to a ban on celestial weapons to ensure their race to the Moon would remain peaceful. Russia\u2019s repudiation of the outer space pact by stationing its doomsday warheads in orbit would end that longstanding truce. Now just a shadow of the one-time Soviet space superpower, Russia is operating \u201ca structurally failing space program,\u201d says James Clay Moltz, one of the top space defense scholars in the U.S. and a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. To mask Russia\u2019s decline as a space power, \u201cPutin seems to have decided that his only card is to threaten U.S. satellites and even the space environment itself,\u201d Professor Moltz told me in an interview. \u201cBut the use of a nuclear weapon in orbit would be an act of international terrorism,\u201d he says. \u201cThe electro-magnetic pulse and radiation would indiscriminately kill astronauts on the International Space Station and taikonauts on China\u2019s Tiangong space station.\u201d The blast could destroy \u201cthousands of satellites that provide information critical to the world economy and human safety on the ground, at sea, and in the air,\u201d adds Professor Moltz, who has written a series of internationally acclaimed books on the expanding dangers of great power conflicts in space, including Crowded Orbits. \u201cAny country that carries out such an act,\u201d he says, \u201cwould be become an instant international pariah.\u201d If Russia did explode a powerful nuclear warhead in the vicinity of the International Space Station, killing its American and European astronauts, and destroying a swath of U.S. satellites, this act of aggression could swiftly cascade into a superpower confrontation, says Professor Jack Beard, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on the mosaic of UN treaties governing space defense and director of the Space, Cyber & National Security Law Program at the University of Nebraska College of Law.

If part of a three-pronged assault on the U.S. - including its astronauts, New Space allies, and military satellites - it would likely be recognised as an \u201carmed attack\u201d under the UN Charter that justifies the use of force in self-defense, Professor Beard told me. Although this hypothetical warhead was not detonated on American territory, he says, the White House and Defense Department would be highly likely to treat it \u201cas an armed attack against the United States itself.\u201d The president would likely quickly declare that the U.S. is reserving the right to respond with armed force. And though the bombing was carried out beyond American borders, Professor Beard says, that does not necessarily preclude a strike against the territory of the responsible state. Formerly a high-ranking counsel at the Pentagon, Professor Beard recounts that when Libyan state-sponsored terrorists were implicated in the bombing of a Berlin discotheque that killed three Americans back in 1986, President Ronald Reagan responded with a series of airstrikes across Libya. In addition to the deaths of American astronauts in outer space, the destruction of the US military satellites could also likely justify the use of force in response, Professor Beard says. If the U.S. did opt to use force in its self-defense, it could also seek to invoke Article 5 of the NATO agreement, which provides for a collective defense following an attack on any single member of the alliance, he says. The beginnings of the next world war, ignited in space, would be set in motion. Check out my website.

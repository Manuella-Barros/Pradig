{"id": 243240564, "title": "Emotional Drew Smith likely headed for second elbow surgery with the Mets", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 An emotional Drew Smith acknowledged his future with the New York Mets is uncertain Friday, when the right-handed reliever and impending free agent said he\u2019d likely need a second reconstructive surgery on his elbow. Smith went on the injured list with a right elbow sprain Tuesday, two days after he exited after getting two outs in the ninth inning of a 5-2 win over the Chicago Cubs because he had a hard time getting loose. The 30-year-old was pressed into action and tried warming up on the field after closer Edwin Diaz was ejected for having an illegal substance on his hand. Smith said an MRI revealed \u201c\u2026some pretty significant damage.\u201d He is scheduled for a second opinion with Dr. Keith Meister but said he expects to undergo either Tommy John surgery or the UCL repair with an internal brace. Smith missed the 2019 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery. \u201cJust sucks, you know?\u201d said Smith, whose voice broke as tears formed in his eyes as he spoke before the Mets\u2019 series opener against the Houston Astros. \u201cMy second one. Been with the Mets for a long time and I love this organization. They\u2019ve done a lot for me. And obviously, going into free agency, it\u2019s a tough time for this to happen. There\u2019s never a good time for it to happen, but this really stings.\u201d Smith, who spent five weeks on the injured list with a sore right shoulder earlier this season, said he began feeling stiffness in the elbow while pitching against the Cubs on June 21. He felt better Saturday but said the discomfort returned quickly Sunday night. \u201cI kind of knew something was going on and I just tried to pitch through it,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the warmup had anything to do with the outcome. I think it was already kind of decided.\u201d Smith was 1-1 with two saves and a 3.06 ERA this season and is 12-13 with a 3.48 ERA and five saves in 191 career games, all with the Mets. He was acquired from the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for Lucas Duda on July 27, 2017, and debuted on June 23, 2018, making him the second-longest tenured player on the team behind left fielder Brandon Nimmo. \u201cNot good news \u2014 it\u2019s hard, obviously, because of who he is not only as a player but as a person, what he means to this organization,\u201d Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. \u201cThis is a professional. He went down early in the year, got back and was always available, always wanted to take the ball, always wanted to help the team.\u201d Smith is the fourth key Mets reliever on the shelf. D\u00edaz is two games into a 10-game suspension for his ejection while Sean Reid-Foley was placed on the injured list last Saturday with a right shoulder impingement. Left-hander Brooks Raley is out for the season after undergoing Tommy John surgery with an internal brace procedure on May 29. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need guys to step up,\u201d Mets president of baseball operations David Stearns said. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21ldHMtZHJldy1zbWl0aC10b21teS1qb2huLTQ4OTY4MDU1ODgxYWQ3NDExMDU2MDhhZWNiZGUzNzE50gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Emotional Drew Smith likely headed for second elbow surgery with the Mets</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/mets-drew-smith-tommy-john-48968055881ad741105608aecbde3719", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/977c333/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3250x1828+0+169/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F37%2F90%2F0f2219b3de45f13135d00ed944b6%2Ff65bab10061940d0b64f872f8c86d5a1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 01:26:25", "author": "Jerry Beach", "authors": ["Jerry Beach"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.265}

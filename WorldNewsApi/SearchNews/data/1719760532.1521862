That was Wharton professor Christian Terwiesch\u2019s conclusion after asking ChatGPT to generate 200 product ideas. The language learning model completed the task in just 15 minutes and came up with better ideas than a cohort of business school students. That said, ChatGPT has its limitations. In another study, researchers found that AI-generated solutions were more valuable, but human solutions were more innovative. That\u2019s why, rather than replacing human creativity, generative AI can be a powerful tool to enhance it. ChatGPT is an efficient and relatively inexpensive collaborator. It can help you get the ball rolling, doing the heavy lifting during the ideation phase and leaving you with more bandwidth to evaluate, fine-tune, and implement. I\u2019m a proponent of automating your busywork and my team regularly uses ChatGPT to help us brainstorm our next big idea. It doesn\u2019t do the work for us, but it offers additional possibilities to consider. If you\u2019re looking for a profitable startup idea, here are some ChatGPT prompts to get the wheels turning. Start With A Frustration I\u2019ve always said: don\u2019t blindly brainstorm your way into a new business. The most successful startups are born from a need, frustration, or opportunity to do something even better. Before I launched my business, I worked for a New York media company where I was tasked with coding forms. The tedium and frustration of my day job inspired me to start an easy-to-use online form company. To give another example, Uber came about when two guys couldn\u2019t hail a taxi in Paris. Applying this approach to ChatGPT, you could use the following prompt: \u201cI am an entrepreneur coming up with startup ideas. Here is a problem I want to solve: [description]. Can you generate 10 different business ideas for solving this problem in the [market]? Use market research to ensure each idea is feasible and profitable.\u201d MORE FOR YOU Trump Trial Prosecutor Ends Closing Argument After Nearly 5 Hours Jury Instructions Set For Wednesday Gas Explosion In Downtown Youngstown Ohio Injures At Least 7 Take Advantage Of The Best Memorial Day Laptop Sales Still Live Target A Specific Market One of the limitations of AI is that it lacks the kind of context that humans acquire through experience and expertise. If you want to serve a specific market, you can combine your human understanding of context with AI\u2019s powerful idea-generation capabilities. Together, you can generate startup ideas targeted to a specific market. For example, I asked ChatGPT to come up with profitable business ideas targeting university students in southern California. That generated a range of interesting ideas, from Eco-Friendly Transportation Rentals and Virtual Reality (VR) Study Aid Platforms to Customizable Dorm Room D\u00e9cor Services. Here\u2019s a prompt to consider: \u201cI am coming up with business ideas for [target market]. Based on market research, can you generate 10 profitable startup ideas to meet their specific wants and needs?\u201d Remember: the more details you provide ChatGPT, the more tailored your answers will be. Boost Accessibility Another approach for finding a profitable startup idea is to increase accessibility for a product that\u2019s proven to be successful. For example, I recently read about a startup called Campo Grande that brings traditional Spanish food products, like Iberian Ham and Vaca Vieja beef, to the U.S. market. They\u2019re not reinventing the wheel\u2014these are time-tested, delicious foods\u2014but they\u2019re making the products more accessible to Spanish-food-loving Americans. For example, I asked ChatGPT for ideas for making French wine more accessible in China. Based on market research, the LLM suggested a Mobile App for Wine Education and Purchases, French Wine Experience Centers, and more. With this approach, the prompt could be: \u201cI am an entrepreneur coming up with profitable business models for making [product or service] more accessible in [region or to population]. Can you come up with 5 ideas for profitable business models?\u201d Pivot Or Expand Your Current Business History is littered with stories of hugely successful businesses that arose from a pivot. Wrigley\u2019s launched as a door-to-door baking soda vendor, with chewing gum as a complimentary gift. They pivoted when they realized customers were more into the gum than their original product. Netflix began as a company that shipped DVDs. As Harvard Business School explains, with the advent of streaming, Netflix incorporated the new technology into its business model. Streaming was a sustaining innovation. As an entrepreneur, it\u2019s critical to understand that your customers are your most important stakeholders. It doesn\u2019t matter how brilliant you think your idea is. If the customers want an adjacent product or service, you must listen to them. But if your startup is struggling to gain traction\u2014maybe your products aren\u2019t \u201csticky\u201d enough\u2014and the pivot isn\u2019t obvious, ChatGPT can help you explore the possibilities. Here\u2019s a prompt to test out: \u201cMy company is a(n) [company description] that serves [target customer]. The idea is to [general mission statement]. We currently have [number] users in [geographical region]. Can you generate 10 possible business pivots to increase our user base? We would like to focus on gaining users that become regular customers.\u201d Ask For Feedback On Your Startup Ideas Whether you\u2019re polishing an important email or editing your pitch deck, ChatGPT can be a valuable resource. Dan Kraemer, co-CEO and co-founder of IA Collaborative, explained how his team uses AI to \u201cconceive future businesses and to make those ideas more likely to become big hits.\u201d For example, once the team settles on a few ideas, they use generative AI to help with due diligence: competitive analysis, market forecasting, labor market statistics and financial modeling. Likewise, you can use ChatGPT to get feedback on your proposed startup idea. The prompt could be: \u201cI am developing a business idea for a profitable startup. The idea is to [product or service description]. For customers, we are targeting [target market] in the [target region]. Can you offer feedback on this idea, including competitive analysis, market forecasting, labor market statistics, and financial modeling?\u201d In just 10-15 seconds, ChatGPT can churn out detailed feedback on your idea. And remember, the more context you provide, the more pointed the reply will be. Help ChatGPT to help you do your job even better. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website.

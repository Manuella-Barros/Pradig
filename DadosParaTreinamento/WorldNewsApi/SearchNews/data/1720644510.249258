Spieth missed the weekend at Muirfield Village by just a single shot, sitting at five-over-par for the tournament following the opening 36 holes. His opening round on Thursday did include an impressive eagle at the par-five seventh, but this was soon cancelled out by a number of mistakes. Five bogeys throughout his opening 18 holes ensured he ended day one with a two-over round of 74, leaving him with plenty of work to do heading into Friday.

The poor showing has come at the wrong time for the American, with the U.S. Open right around the corner. Spieth was not the only man to struggle at the Memorial though, with defending U.S. Open champion Wyndham Clark also missing the cut. Clark, who won the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am earlier this year, will have been hoping to recapture that form ahead of his title defence next Thursday. It was not to be though, as like his Ryder Cup teammate, Clark also missed the cut by one after a stuttered finish on Friday. A double-bogey on the par-five 15th, and then a bogey at 18 cost the U.S. Open champion dearly, as he was unable to make up for his poor start on Thursday which saw him shoot a five-over 77. For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US. Clark's 2024 has been a mixed one, having missed the cut at the two previous major championships in the Masters and U.S. PGA, despite winning at Pebble Beach in February. Elsewhere it was also a week to forget for Patrick Cantlay, whose struggles on the golf course continued at Muirfield Village. Cantlay has struggled to find the form that has made him one of the top players in the world in recent years so far this season, and it was more of the same for the American on Friday. He followed up a three-over 75 on Thursday, with a four-over 76 a day later to miss the Memorial cut by three shots. The worst week of the tournament however belonged to Rickie Fowler, having ended his tournament two days early in dead-last place at 13-over-par. Fowler was far from his best in round one on Thursday, carding a frustrating four-over 76 to begin his tournament. There was no signs of bounce back a day later though, as he made three double bogeys and six bogeys on the way to a dismal 10-over 82 in round two. The six-time PGA Tour winner will be hoping to change his fortunes next week, as he chases down his victory on the major stage.", "summary": "Jordan Spieth struggled to find his best form at the Memorial Tournament on Thursday and Friday, missing the cut at Muirfield Village just days before the U.S. Open begins", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/golf/jordan-spieth-pga-us-open-32988171", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32988175.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-2155745384.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:09:39", "author": "Joshua Lees,Joshua-Lees", "authors": ["Joshua Lees", "Joshua-Lees"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.328}

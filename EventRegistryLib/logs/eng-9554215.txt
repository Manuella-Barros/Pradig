Explaining that their plan \"seeks to increase rugby's accessibility and relevance among a broader, younger fanbase by embracing on-field innovation and reimagined presentation of the sport with compelling storytelling,\" the governing body also announced several trials to take place at this summer's Under-20 World Championship that could be rolled out across the game next year.\n\nThe first immediate change will see scrums outlawed from free-kicks, with teams required to kick or tap them to speed up the game.\n\nSouth Africa notoriously called for scrums from free-kicks following marks in their own 22 during the knockout stages of last year's World Cup.\n\nThe second change concerns kicks in open play, and the clause popularly known as 'Dupont Law'. From July 1, it will no longer be possible for a player to be put onside when an opponent catches the ball and either runs five metres or passes the ball. In a bid to reduce the amount of kick tennis, offside players must now retreat.\n\nFinally, the 'crocodile roll' - the act of twisting a defending player in the tackle area off their feet - will be outlawed. Christian Day, the current head of the Rugby Players' Association, has been campaigning against the 'crocodile roll' for over two years and was an influential voice.\n\nThe changes are unlikely to end with the three laws introduced from July 1, given several new trials have been announced. Twenty-minute red cards, whereby the offending player can be replaced after that period rather than permanently excluded and which have been promoted by Super Rugby competitions over recent years, are part of a suite of six 'closed law trials' that will be used in World Rugby competitions, including the World U20 Championship, over the coming year.\n\nThere will also be a trial of automatic bans for certain offences in a concerted move from World Rugby to streamline the disciplinary process to avoid the confusion and inconsistency that has marred the game in recent years.\n\nThe 20-minute red cards will be off-set by a revised on-and off-field sanctions process with suspensions attached to offences. Days of mitigation for good behaviour at hearings or for previously clean records could be gone.\n\nFoul play, where a player has \"attempted to affect a legal rugby action\" will bring about a two-week ban\". Aggravated foul play, involving \"highly reckless\" actions such as tucked arms, shoulder-charges and spear tackles, will be worth four-week suspensions. Mitigation will only come into force if there is an appeal.\n\nTeams in the U20 World Championships and in other World Rugby competitions such as the Pacific Nations Cup and WXV will have 30 seconds to set scrums and line-outs. The shot clock for a conversion will be reduced from 90 seconds to 60.\n\nThere is to be added protection for scrum-halves at the bases of scrums, rucks and mauls, with the offside line for defending scrum-halves moved back to the middle of the scrum.\n\nPlayers will be able to mark the ball inside their own 22 from a restart, which has been introduced to encourage short restarts and discourage caterpillar rucks, which teams often use to clear the ball down-field. Finally, mauls can only stop once before the ball has to be played and, if line-outs are uncontested, then throws cannot be called as 'not straight'.\n\nThese trial laws were discussed at the Shape of the Game conference in February and findings will be presented to the World Rugby Council in November. From there, they could be rolled out more widely.

Explaining that their plan \"seeks to increase rugby's accessibility and relevance among a broader, younger fanbase by embracing on-field innovation and reimagined presentation of the sport with compelling storytelling,\" the governing body also announced several trials to take place at this summer's Under-20 World Championship that could be rolled out across the game next year.\n\nThe first immediate change will see scrums outlawed from free-kicks, with teams required to kick or tap them to speed up the game.\n\nThe second change concerns kicks in open play, and the clause popularly known as 'Dupont Law'. From July 1, it will no longer be possible for a player to be put onside when an opponent catches the ball and either runs five metres or passes the ball. In a bid to reduce the amount of kick tennis, offside players must now retreat.\n\nFinally, the 'crocodile roll' - the act of twisting a defending player in the tackle area off their feet - will be outlawed. Christian Day, the current head of the Rugby Players' Association, has been campaigning against the 'crocodile roll' for over two years and was an influential voice.\n\nThe changes are unlikely to end with the three laws introduced from July 1, given several new trials have been announced. Twenty-minute red cards, whereby the offending player can be replaced after that period rather than permanently excluded and which have been promoted by Super Rugby competitions over recent years, are part of a suite of six 'closed law trials' that will be used in World Rugby competitions, including the World U20 Championship, over the coming year.\n\nThere will also be a trial of automatic bans for certain offences in a concerted move from World Rugby to streamline the disciplinary process to avoid the confusion and inconsistency that has marred the game in recent years.\n\nThe 20-minute red cards will be off-set by a revised on-and off-field sanctions process with suspensions attached to offences. Days of mitigation for good behaviour at hearings or for previously clean records could be gone.\n\nFoul play, where a player has \"attempted to affect a legal rugby action\" will bring about a two-week ban\". Aggravated foul play, involving \"highly reckless\" actions such as tucked arms, shoulder-charges and spear tackles, will be worth four-week suspensions. Mitigation will only come into force if there is an appeal.\n\nTeams in the U20 World Championships and in other World Rugby competitions such as the Pacific Nations Cup and WXV will have 30 seconds to set scrums and line-outs. The shot clock for a conversion will be reduced from 90 seconds to 60.\n\nThere is to be added protection for scrum-halves at the bases of scrums, rucks and mauls, with the offside line for defending scrum-halves moved back to the middle of the scrum.\n\nPlayers will be able to mark the ball inside their own 22 from a restart, which has been introduced to encourage short restarts and discourage caterpillar rucks, which teams often use to clear the ball down-field. Finally, mauls can only stop once before the ball has to be played and, if line-outs are uncontested, then throws cannot be called as 'not straight'.\n\nThese trial laws were discussed at the Shape of the Game conference in February and findings will be presented to the World Rugby Council in November. From there, they could be rolled out more widely. They could be implemented in earlier competitions if participating unions choose to introduce them.\n\n\"I would like to thank my colleagues from across the game for embracing the spirit of this comprehensive review of rugby's entertainment factor,\" said Bill Beaumont, the World Rugby chairman. \"With calendar certainty, including new competitions and all men's and women's Rugby World Cups set through to 2033, our major events are defined, our content set.\n\n\"There is unprecedented long-term certainty, and this work is vital to ensuring that the on-field product is befitting of the opportunities that we have in front of us, a superb sport that is enjoyable to play and watch and helps attract a new generation to get into rugby.\n\n\"Personally, I believe that the law amendments and suite of closed trials will add to the entertainment factor.

Recommendations will be made to Council in November.\n\nNew rugby laws labs established to test future potential innovations\n\nNew rugby law labs, which enable World Rugby to test out new law innovations in a controlled environment evaluated by data and player feedback, will be utilised to examine the impact of aspects of the game that either affect speed or safety. These will include scrum engagement stability and enhancing the tackle/ruck area.\n\nWorld Rugby Chairman, Sir Bill Beaumont said: \"I would like to thank my colleagues from across the game for embracing the spirit of this comprehensive review of rugby's entertainment factor. With calendar certainty, including new competitions and all men's and women's Rugby World Cups set through to 2033, our major events are defined, our content set.\n\n\"There is unprecedented long-term certainty, and this work is vital to ensuring that the on-field product is befitting of the opportunities that we have in front of us, a superb sport that is enjoyable to play and watch and helps attract a new generation to get into rugby.\n\n\"Personally, I believe that the law amendments and suite of closed trials will add to the entertainment factor. As with all trials, we will comprehensively review their effectiveness and take feedback from across the game. The revised red card sanction process is such an example, and it is important that we trial, assess and make definitive decisions based on data and feedback.\"", "source": {"uri": "saru-umbraco.azurewebsites.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "SA Rugby"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crocodile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby_Pacific_Nations_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby_Under_20_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby Under 20 Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_piece_(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Set piece (football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rugby World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Beaumont", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Beaumont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(rugby)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scrum (rugby)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://saru-umbraco.azurewebsites.net//media/nsqi2ztj/230911-steven-kitshoff-springboks-scrum.jpg?anchor=center&mode=crop&width=945&height=472&rnd=133390824347400000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554215", "eventUri": "eng-9554215", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

But there is little doubt that the Springboks, with their power game and team composition consisting of nearly two full packs of world-class forwards, are at least partly responsible for one change, after it was announced that scrums from free kicks will no longer be allowed.\n\nThis is one of three law changes that will come into effect on 1 July, with several others set to be tested at global competitions in the coming months.\n\nWorld Rugby stated that the changes and possible future changes \"seek to increase rugby's accessibility and relevance among a broader, younger fanbase by embracing on-field innovation and reimagined presentation of the sport with compelling storytelling\". No, I don't understand either.\n\nWhat is apparent is that the new laws appear to view scrums as a hindrance, rather than an integral part of what makes rugby union unique.\n\nAt the Stade de France in October, Springbok fullback Damian Willemse famously called for a scrum from a mark during the Rugby World Cup quarterfinal against France.\n\nA mark is essentially a free kick and nothing in the laws stopped the Boks from opting for a scrum, even though no one could think of another example of it being done. Despite losing territory, the Boks backed their scrum to hurt Les Bleus. And it did as they won a penalty from the set piece.\n\nThat incident was hailed as revolutionary by some but decried as being against the spirit of the game by others. It's impossible to imagine why doing something which had never been tried in more than 100 years was deemed unfair.\n\nWorld Rugby on Thursday announced that: \"Under Law 20.3, it will no longer be possible to choose a scrum from a free kick. Free kicks must either be tapped or kicked to encourage more ball in flow.\"\n\nLet's pause there for a moment. Never mind a scrum from a mark, which as we know has only been done once, this change means that any time there is a free kick, a team cannot opt for a scrum.\n\nImagine a scenario where two teams are scrumming and the referee penalises the attacking team's scrumhalf for a skew feed. It is a free kick. Under the new laws, the team awarded the free kick cannot ask for another scrum, even though the infringement happened at a scrum.\n\nWhat about a situation where a team with a weaker scrum manipulates a free kick, even against itself? The team with the stronger scrum will no longer have the option to call for another scrum. This seems unfair, because scrums are vital to rugby.\n\nIn this scramble to encourage \"ball-in-hand rugby\" to make the sport more palatable to a younger audience, a cornerstone of the game is being undermined.\n\nIronically, there is a school of thought that believes scrums do lead to more space on the field, and therefore more incentive to keep the ball in hand, because they concentrate 18 players (including the scrumhalves) in a small area. That opens up space in a larger area.\n\nUnder the new law, tap-and-go penalties, kicking for touch, or launching an up-and-under are the only available options from a free kick.\n\nThe second change focuses on kicks in open play, and the clause commonly known as the \"Dupont Law\" because of France's propensity to engage in \"kick-tennis\".\n\nIn future, it will no longer be possible for a player to be put onside when an opposition player catches the ball and runs 5m, or passes the ball. Laws 10.1 and 10.4 will make clear that offside players must attempt to retreat, creating space for the opposition team to play. This should reduce the amount of kick-tennis in the game.\n\nIronically, Willemse's call for a scrum from a mark against France was the result of precisely this problem of kick-tennis.\n\nThe third change set to come into effect on 1 July is outlawing the action of rolling/twisting/or pulling of a player on their feet in the tackle area (the \"crocodile roll\"). This is essentially about player safety and not a change that many would argue against.\n\nIn addition to the three changes, there are also ongoing closed law trials in selected competitions such as the U20 World Championships and the Pacific Nations Cup.\n\nThe 20-minute red card, which is currently being used in the U20 Rugby Championship in Queensland, will also be used at the U20 World Championship in Cape Town next month.\n\nIn this trial, a player receiving a red card can be replaced after 20 minutes -- which happened to the Junior Boks against Australia this week.\n\nThe intention is to not unduly affect the integrity of a game because of the indiscretion of a single player. But this proposal comes with stricter sanctions under a revised on-field and off-field sanctions process.\n\nThe aim is to promote consistency and simplicity, making it easier for players and fans to navigate, while upholding player welfare.\n\nAutomatic sanctions, involving suspension for set periods, with no mitigation, will be issued for red-card offences. Where a player has attempted to make a legal tackle, but was due a red card anyway, they will receive a two-week suspension.\n\nIf the red card is issued for an illegal tackle such as a spear tackle, or shoulder charge, a four-week ban is automatically applied. Mitigation will only be considered if there is an appeal.\n\nIn another closed trial, teams in the U20 World Championships and other World Rugby competitions such as the Pacific Nations Cup and WXV will have 30 seconds to set scrums and line-outs. The shot clock for a conversion will be reduced from 90 seconds to 60.\n\nThe other closed trials are:\n\nThese trial laws came under discussion at the \"Shape of the Game\" conference in February. The results of the closed trial will be evaluated with a recommendation made to the World Rugby Council in November.\n\n\"This work is vital to ensuring that the on-field product is befitting of the opportunities that we have in front of us, a superb sport that is enjoyable to play and watch and helps attract a new generation to get into rugby,\" the World Rugby chairperson, Sir Bill Beaumont said.\n\n\"Personally, I believe that the law amendments and suite of closed trials will add to the entertainment factor. As with all trials, we will comprehensively review their effectiveness and take feedback from across the game.\n\n\"The revised red card sanction process is such an example, and it is important that we trial, assess and make definitive decisions based on data and feedback.\" DM", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Maverick"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This should reduce the amount of kick tennis in the game.\"\n\nWorld Rugby has also confirmed that the option of a scrum has been removed for a free-kick, with teams having to either tap-and-go or kick the ball, which World Rugby say will \"encourage more ball flow\".\n\nThe governing body have not clarified whether or not this applies to free-kicks that have been given at a scrum, with critics of the change believing it gives teams losing the scrum battle an easy out.\n\nThe other law change will see the controversial 'Crocodile roll' outlawed at rucks, with the action of rolling, twisting or pulling of a player on their feet in the tackle area to be sanctioned by a penalty.\n\nAdditionally, WR has announced a series of law trials, which will be rolled out across the World Rugby U20 Championship, U20 Trophy and Pacific Nations Cup this summer.\n\nAmong the trials will be the controversial 20-minute red card, which allows teams to replace a red-carded player with a substitute after 20 minutes.\n\nThe trials will also see a 30-second shot clock introduced for scrum and lineout setting, while the conversion shot clock will be reduced from 90 seconds to 60.\n\nIn a bid to reduce the number of scrums in a game, crooked lineouts will also be permitted if the opposition don't contest the ball.\n\nWorld Rugby are also set to streamline their disciplinary process, with a closed trial for automatic sanctions to be issued for red cards in situations where a player has attempted to make a legal tackle or not attempted to make a legal tackle.\n\nThe trial, which will be in use for the WXV and World Rugby U20 Championship this summer, will see automatic bans be applied to red cards involving foul play, promoting consistency of outcomes.\n\nAccording to World Rugby, the new sanctions will be:\n\nFoul play - Automatic two weeks: where a player has attempted to affect a legal rugby action and/or has committed a reckless action but has made minor errors such as in technique or timing\n\nAggravated foul play - Automatic four weeks: where a player has affected a highly reckless action and/or a non-legal rugby action (tucked arm, no attempt to wrap, driving tackle)\n\nA Sanction Committee comprising members with rugby experience will calibrate all red card sanctions from a round/weekend of matches.

The offence will now be punished by a penalty.\n\nWorld Rugby has also announced the trial of a revised red card process that will be observed in competition such as the WXV women's tournament and the Pacific Nations Cup.\n\nIt will see automatic bans applied for red cards involving foul play, while a player sent off can be replaced by another player from the bench after 20 minutes, restoring a side to its full strength of 15 players.\n\n\"I believe that the law amendments and suite of closed trials will add to the entertainment factor,\" said World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont.\n\n\"As with all trials, we will comprehensively review their effectiveness and take feedback from across the game,\" the former England captain added.\n\n- \u00a9 AFP 2024", "source": {"uri": "the42.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The42"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@the42.ie", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(rugby)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scrum (rugby)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_British_&_Irish_Lions_tour_to_South_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2009 British & Irish Lions tour to South Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Dupont", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Dupont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WXV", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WXV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby_Pacific_Nations_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Beaumont", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Beaumont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejection_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ejection (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Coaching_and_Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Coaching and Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6375859/listing?version=6375861&width=590", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554215", "eventUri": "eng-9554215", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 210, "textEnd": 216}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

If the catcher of the ball runs five metres or throws a pass, then they're onside.\n\n\"It's something the lawmakers are going to have to change.\"\n\nIn practice, this loophole can ruin the spectacle of a game as it can halt the action on the pitch and allow players to kick the ball unchallenged.\n\nHowever, it appears the issue could be a thing of the past with the sport's governing body World Rugby announcing amendments to its laws.\n\nWorld Rugby has issued a statement confirming that the 'Dupont Law' is one of three laws set to be ameneded from July 1.\n\nA statement from the organisation confirmed that Law 10.7 - which had been exploited - has been rewritten.\n\n\"In a rewrite of Law 10.7 relating to players being put onside from kicks in open play, it will no longer be possible for a player to be put onside when an opposition player catches the ball and runs five metres, or passes the ball,\" it read.\n\n\"It will no longer be possible for a player to be put onside when an opposition player catches the ball and runs five metres, or passes the ball\n\n\"Laws 10.1 and 10.4 will make clear that offside players must make an attempt to retreat, creating space for the opposition team to play. This should reduce the amount of kick tennis in the game.\"\n\nIt is not the only significant change set to come into effect, with 'crocodile rolls' - a technique used to clear-out opponents at the ruck - set to be deemed illegal when the rules come into effect.\n\nThat tackle technique has been a contentious issue with players - including Toulouse's Jack Wills - picking up serious knee injuries from it in the past.\n\nPenalties will be awarded to teams in the event that their player is subjected to the technique at the breakdown.\n\nThe third rule change will ensure that teams who win free-kicks will no longer be able to opt for scrums.\n\nInstead, free-kicks must either be tapped or kicked to encourage more open play.\n\nRule amendments are usually a contentious topic but one suspects these amendments will be well-received by rugby supporters far and wide.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rob_o_halloran@balls.ie", "name": "Rob O'Halloran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Nations_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Six Nations Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Dupont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Dupont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bernard Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT\u00c9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RT\u00c9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Rugby_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Rugby Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Rugby_Champions_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Rugby Champions Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offside_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offside (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(rugby)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scrum (rugby)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toulouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toulouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Coaching_and_Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Coaching and Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wNVxcXC8wOTIwNDkxOVxcXC9VbnRpdGxlZC1kZXNpZ24tMzAucG5nXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjEyMDAsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjo2MjcsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5iYWxscy5pZVxcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvYnJhbmQtaW1hZ2UuanBnXCIsXCJvcHRpb25zXCI6W119IiwiaGFzaCI6IjhhZDE5NjRmMjdkNGU2MWMyNTkxMzQ1ZTEzNWYzYzgwYTkxMzg1N2UifQ==/worldrugbyannounceschangestocombatdupontlawandtwootherissuesballsie.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554215", "eventUri": "eng-9554215", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1447, "textEnd": 1453}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

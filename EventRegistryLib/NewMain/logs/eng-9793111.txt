He's pushing Olu.''\n\nAs Macdonald said those remarks, events three time zones away indicated the Seahawks could add to the competition at center.\n\nFormer Dallas Cowboy and Miami Dolphin Connor Williams, who was the second-highest graded center in the NFL last season by Pro Football Focus before suffering an ACL tear in December.\n\nMacdonald confirmed earlier in camp that the Seahawks had Williams in for a free-agent visit, during which Williams reportedly passed a physical.\n\nMonday, Williams' agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said on a radio show in Miami that he is negotiating with the Seahawks and that a deal could get done in the next 48-72 hours.\n\n\"He's in negotiations with the Seahawks and there's a few other teams,'' Rosenhaus said on The Joe Rose Show. \"I wouldn't be surprised if Connor signs within the next 48 to 72 hours.''\n\nRosenhaus mentioning other teams indicates it's not a slam dunk Williams comes to Seattle.\n\nBut the Seahawks' interest, if not need, is there.\n\nLike all NFL teams, the Seahawks know Rosenhaus well -- his long list of clients also includes safety Julian Love, and Rosenhaus was in town last month to help finalize that deal. That's when Williams apparently had his visit.\n\nAsked last week if there was anything new in talks with Williams, Macdonald said no.\n\nIn his initial comments on Williams the week before he said the team \"had a great visit'' with Williams.\n\n\"Coming off injuries, things like that, the timetable's a little up in the air,'' Macdonald said then. \"We'll see where it goes.''\n\nThe issue, as it usually is, is money, and Rosenhaus is one of the shrewder negotiators in the NFL and certainly could be trying to accelerate a deal getting done with his comments Monday.\n\nA report from ESPN over the weekend said the Seahawks remain interested in Williams, with money the key factor.\n\nThe Seahawks have just over $10 million in available cap space after adding about $1.5 million via Love's extension (which pushed some of his money for this season into future years).\n\nGiven that teams need $4-6 million to get through the regular season, the Seahawks surely have to be careful, and Williams' health could also be a factor in how much of a commitment they want to make.\n\nMonday, Rosenhaus -- as would be expected of an agent -- said he doesn't think there would be any risk for the Seahawks in signing Williams.\n\n\"He's healthy,'' Rosenhaus was quoted as saying as reported by SI.com of Williams, who tore his ACL on Dec. 11 against the Titans. \"He's going to be able to play in the first game. It is the most amazing recovery I have ever seen in my career.''\n\nIf the Seahawks were to get Williams and he was able to immediately plug in at center, it would go a long way to answering one of the team's biggest questions marks on offense.\n\nThey appear set on the left side of the line with tackle Charles Cross -- a third-year player who has consistently won raves for his play in camp -- and free agent guard Laken Tomlinson, a Pro Bowler in 2021 with the 49ers who has 114 consecutive starts and has 138 starts overall since 2015 with the Lions, 49ers and Jets.\n\nThe Seahawks seem to feel OK about the right side of the line.\n\nWhile third-year player Abraham Lucas, a third-round pick out of WSU in 2022, remains out of action after having knee surgery in January, the Seahawks covered their bases with the signing of veteran free-agent George Fant, who has consistently worked with the ones in camp. Fant has 72 career starts including 13 last year in the regular season with the Texans and two more in the playoffs.\n\nRight guard remains more in question as to who starts, but the Seahawks seem to like the players it has there, as well.\n\nSecond-year player Anthony Bradford, who got 10 starts last year, has consistently worked with the starters. But he is backed up by rookie third-round pick Christian Haynes of UConn. If the season began today, Bradford would appear to get the start there. But the team remains high on the potential of Haynes.\n\nThat leaves center, which is a battle of Oluwatimi -- who started one game last year in place of Evan Brown -- and Harris, who has four career starts in four seasons with Cleveland before signing in March.\n\nExperience isn't an issue with Williams.\n\nWilliams, a 6-5, 312-pounder, was the 50 overall pick by Dallas in 2018 out of Texas. He started the next four years at left guard for the Cowboys.\n\nHe struggled some at left guard in 2021, and Dallas didn't match an offer he got in free agency from Miami for two years and $14 million.\n\nThe Dolphins decided to move Williams to center, something Dallas had tried briefly.\n\nWilliams started all 17 games in 2022 as the Dolphins improved to 22 in the NFL in offense to 11 in the first year under Mike McDaniel, and then nine more last season before his injury.\n\nPro Football Focus recently mentioned Williams as one of the top remaining unsigned free agents, writing: \"Williams' free agency has likely been delayed by the fact that he is coming off a season-ending injury, but it was a season during which he set a career high with an 86.5 PFF grade as the Dolphins' starting center. At this point in the offseason, his best route to a long-term contract might be to sign a short-term, prove-it deal. ... Williams' experience when fully healthy could be vital for a team that should be a competitor in the NFC in 2024.''\n\nVia PFF, Williams was especially good run blocking, finishing with the second-best run block grade of all centers. He was seventh against the pass. He also rated fourth among all centers in 2022, giving credence to the idea that maybe he should have been playing center all along.\n\nMacdonald earlier in camp made clear that if Williams were to come to Seattle, it would be as a center.\n\n\"He's got position flex,'' Macdonald said. \"But last year he did a great job at center, so I think that's where you'd find him if he were here.''\n\nMacdonald seemed to foreshadow that a move involving the offensive line could still be to come Saturday when he said, \"I don't think we've found the final five right now.''", "source":

Williams' experience when fully healthy could be vital for a team that should be a competitor in the NFC in 2024.''\n\nVia PFF, Williams was especially good run blocking, finishing with the second-best run block grade of all centers. He was seventh against the pass. He also rated fourth among all centers in 2022, giving credence to the idea that maybe he should have been playing center all along.\n\nMacdonald earlier in camp made clear that if Williams were to come to Seattle, it would be as a center.\n\n\"He's got position flex,'' Macdonald said. \"But last year he did a great job at center, so I think that's where you'd find him if he were here.''\n\nMacdonald seemed to foreshadow that a move involving the offensive line could still be to come Saturday when he said, \"I don't think we've found the final five right now.''\n\nThe next 24-48 hours should answer if Williams might be part of that mix.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Williams, who tore his ACL with the Miami Dolphins last season, is expected to have a deal with the Seahawks in the next 48 to 72 hours, according to his agent Drew Rosenhaus on the Joe Rose Radio show.\n\nWilliams tore his ACL last December against the Tennessee Titans, and Rosenhaus mentioned that he'll be ready to play in Week 1.\n\n\"He was on his way to a Pro Bowl season and a lucrative contract extension. Tore his ACL. And this guy fought so hard. He's healthy. He's going to be able to play in the first game,\" Rosenhaus said. \"It is the most amazing recovery I have ever seen in my career.\"\n\nWilliams visited with the Seahawks earlier in training camp, and the two sides must like each other if a deal is on the horizon.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks will be getting one of the league's best centers\n\nConnor Williams switched to center when he signed with the Miami Dolphins in 2022 after beginning his career as a left guard for the Dallas Cowboys. Before tearing his ACL last season, Williams had only allowed six quarterback pressures and a single sack on 280 pass-blocking snaps.\n\nThe Dolphins decided to replace Williams with former Titans center Aaron Brewer, signing him to a three-year, $21 million deal. Williams might be looking for a contract around that amount of money, especially considering how he played before he was injured. The Seahawks have roughly $10 million left in cap space after freeing up some money with Pro Bowl safety Julian Love's contract extension.\n\nThe Seahawks did not have the best offensive line in 2023, and adding Williams would greatly improve their play in the trenches. Keeping Geno Smith clean in the pocket will be major if the Seahawks want to stay competitive this season and make the playoffs, and Williams could be the major piece they need.\n\nWilliams has also shown to be good in run blocking, which will open the field for Kenneth Walker III, who has turned into a dynamic running back since entering the league. The Seahawks were near the bottom of the league in rushing yards last season, and that can change with an athletic center like Williams manning the middle. He posted a 90.5 run-blocking grade which was the second-highest grade for centers, according to PFF.\n\nBringing back the core group on offense is big for the Seahawks, as they look to build on what they've done the past few seasons with Smith as the quarterback.

The deal reportedly comes with $3 million in guaranteed money and marks the first significant financial investment the organization has made on an established starting center since Justin Britt signed a three-year extension in 2017.\n\nWilliams, 27, began his NFL career as a second-round pick for the Cowboys in 2018 after a standout college career at Texas where he earned All-American honors, opening his career playing left guard. He logged 3,312 snaps at the position in four seasons in Dallas before bolting in free agency to join Miami in 2022, and his new team slid him to center.\n\nSpending the last two seasons with the Dolphins, Williams started 26 games at center and excelled at the pivot position, allowing just 21 pressures and four sacks on more than 900 pass blocking snaps during that span per Pro Football Focus. Unfortunately, while playing at an All-Pro level for Miami last season as the anchor of the offensive line, he suffered a season-ending torn ACL in December, which put his status for the start of the 2024 season in limbo as he headed towards free agency.\n\nWith a lengthy recovery ahead of him, the Dolphins opted to sign former Titans starting center Aaron Brewer as his replacement in free agency. Remaining unsigned with training camps opening across the league in late July, he met with the Seahawks and passed his physical, but the two sides weren't able to strike a deal at that point and he continued to speak with other suitors.\n\nSince then, the Seahawks have remained in negotiations with Williams as other teams looked into signing him as well, including the Ravens. All along, Seattle seemed like the likely landing spot, as agent Drew Rosenhaus indicated the two sides were still working on a potential deal as a guest on the Joe Rose Radio Show, saying that a deal could come together within 48 to 72 hours.\n\nAs it turns out, Rosenhaus' comments may have been the leverage creator to squeeze a bit more money out of the Seahawks, especially with Williams meeting with the Ravens on Monday.

The team is set to sign former Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins center Connor Williams to a one-year deal.\n\nMore news: Titans Starting Right Guard Shockingly Retires\n\nAccording to Adam Schefter, \"Former Dolphins and Cowboys center Connor Williams reached agreement on a one-year deal worth up to $6 million, including $3M guaranteed, with the Seattle Seahawks. The deal was negotiated and confirmed by Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Matha.\"\n\nWilliams had been a free agent at the conclusion of the 2023 season and had been working his way back from a torn ACL. He now joins the Seahawks to bolster the protection for quarterback Geno Smith.\n\nWilliams began his career with the Dallas Cowboys when he was drafted No. 50 overall in the 2018 NFL Draft. Initially, he was slated to be the starting left guard, but lost the job to Xavier Su'a-Filo. Williams would eventually step in as right guard for the injured Zack Martin.\n\nThe 2019 season saw Williams slotted in as the starting left guard, but he would suffer his first torn ACL during the season. Williams would remain with the Cowboys until 2021.\n\nIn 2022, Williams signed a two-year deal with the Miami Dolphins. He would switch to center for the Dolphins, starting all 17 games. He only allowed three sacks, committed six penalties, and became the only player on the team to participate in all 1,057 offensive snaps.\n\nHeading into the 2023 season, Williams began a contract hold out, searching for a new deal. He would rejoin the team and end his hold out later in the offseason, ultimately participating in training camp.\n\nWilliams was playing in a contract year, and the 2023 season resulted in more injuries. Williams suffered a groin injury in Week 3 and was replaced by Liam Eichenberg.\n\nWilliams would then suffer his second torn ACL in Week 14, once again ending his season prematurely. The injuries came at the worst time, as Williams was angling for a new contract.\n\nWilliams was instead allowed to test the free agent market. His recovery has been going well so far, and multiple teams were in contact with the center. However, the Seahawks had been the most active in attempting to sign him.\n\nThat has now become the case, and Williams can earn up to $6 million this season. He also has a chance to rebound his career on a potential NFC contender in the Seahawks. After a 2023 full of injuries for Smith, he will get a Pro Bowl-caliber center protecting him.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brizuela@newsweek.com", "name": "James Brizuela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Williams_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connor Williams (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Rosenhaus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Rosenhaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zack Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Su'a-Filo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Su'a-Filo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geno_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geno Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liam_Eichenberg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liam Eichenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2444602/former-dallas-cowboys-center-connor-williams.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=d39c99df51fc200c688c1ec15ce5d048", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793111", "eventUri": "eng-9793111", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The seventh-year veteran is coming off a season-ending knee injury from last December but passed a physical during a visit to Seahawks headquarters at the start of training camp, according to Schefter.\n\nWilliams, 27, visited the Baltimore Ravens on Monday. His agent, Drew Rosenhaus, told 560 WQAM sports radio in Miami earlier Monday that he could join a new team this week. Rosenhaus was responding to a question that asked whether Williams - who tore his ACL on Dec. 11 while playing for the Miami Dolphins - is healthy and whether he's close to signing somewhere.\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, he is healthy. He absolutely is,\" Rosenhaus told the radio station. \"He's in negotiations with the Seahawks, and there's a few other teams. I wouldn't be surprised if Connor signs within the next 48 to 72 hours. It's a wonderful development for Connor, who had a heartbreaking injury in the Titans Monday night game. He was on his way to a Pro Bowl season and a lucrative contract extension. Tore his ACL and this guy fought so hard. We weren't even sure if he was going to play this year, and now he's going to be ready to play in the first game of the season. It's probably, in my career, without a doubt one of the greatest comebacks I've ever seen.\"\n\nA second-round pick by the Cowboys out of Texas in 2018, Williams was primarily a left guard over his first four seasons with Dallas, though he also played some right guard as a rookie. He moved to center after signing a two-year, $14 million deal with Miami in March of 2022, starting all 17 games there that season and nine in 2023 before his knee injury.\n\nMike Macdonald said after Williams' visit last month that he thought Williams would play center for Seattle if the two sides were to reach a deal. Olu Oluwatimi, a 2023 fifth-round pick, has been leading veteran Nick Harris in the battle to win that job, with neither player distinguishing himself over the first two weeks of camp.\n\nThe Seahawks may have to clear some salary cap space in order to make room for his contract. The team had a little over $10 million after signing safety Julian Love to a three-year, $33 million extension early in camp, according to OverTheCap.com. It is believed that the Seahawks were also up against their cash budget after Love's deal, which calls for $8 million of his $10.5 million signing bonus to be paid out this year.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Rosenhaus", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drew Rosenhaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WQAM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WQAM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_bonus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Signing bonus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0606%2Fr1183209_1232x693_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793111", "eventUri": "eng-9793111", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-11", "textStart": 802, "textEnd": 809}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

He's going to be able to play in the first game,\" Rosenhaus said on Monday (h/t Scott Salomon of Miami Dolphins on SI). \"It is the most amazing recovery I have ever seen in my career.\"\n\nThis is obviously a great addition for the Seahawks, who get one of the game's top centers in both the run and pass games.\n\nIt's also a chance for Williams to improve a position that has been a trouble spot for Seattle, as ESPN's Brady Henderson noted.\n\nUltimately, it's a great pickup for the Seahawks at a very reasonable price tag as the team looks to start a new era under head coach Mike Macdonald on the right foot.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_kasabian@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Paul Kasabian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Williams_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connor Williams (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Rosenhaus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drew Rosenhaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1722989052/c4ey0l5ihzbhn365xo2p.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793111", "eventUri": "eng-9793111", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2011-12-", "textStart": 528, "textEnd": 535}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks reached agreement on a one-year deal worth up to $6 million with veteran offensive lineman Connor Williams on Tuesday.\n\nWilliams' representatives Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Matha confirmed the agreement to The Associated Press, which includes $3 million guaranteed.\n\nWilliams likely will be thrown into the competition at center where Seattle has the most uncertainty on its offensive line. Olu Oluwatimi, a fifth-round pick in 2023, was the presumptive starter, but Nick Harris has been thrown into the mix in the past week and coach Mike Macdonald said Monday the competition was on between the pair.\n\nWilliams is coming off a season cut short by injury after tearing the ACL in his left knee in Week 14 while playing for Miami. At the time of his injury, Williams was rated as one of the top centers in the NFL by Pro Football Focus.\n\nWilliams visited Seattle at the start of training camp last month.\n\n\"We had a great visit. I think he's a great player, but again, there's a process with these things,\" Macdonald said on July 24, the first day of training camp. \"People being free agents, coming off injuries, things like that. The timetable's a little bit up in the air right now, but we'll see where it goes.\"\n\nWilliams signed a two-year deal with Miami before the 2022 season and started every game he played in over those two seasons with the Dolphins. Prior to his time in Miami, Williams spent his first four seasons in Dallas, where he made 51 starts in the regular season.\n\nAdding Williams should help solidify Seattle's offensive line. Charles Cross will start at left tackle with Laken Tomlinson at left guard. Anthony Bradford or rookie Christian Haynes appear to be the options at right guard, with veteran George Fant expected at right tackle until Abraham Lucas is able to get back on the field due to a knee issue that cost him most of last season.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tim_booth@register-herald.com", "name": "Tim Booth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Williams_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connor Williams (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Rosenhaus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drew Rosenhaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Cross_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Cross (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Fant_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Fant (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laken_Tomlinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laken Tomlinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/custom/image/b87268c4-7873-11e7-af9a-f3a04545878a.jpg?resize=200%2C200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793111", "eventUri": "eng-9793111", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 1194, "textEnd": 1201}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

He emerged in 2022 and 2023 as one of the league's most athletic centers, and his ability to get out and block in space was key to Miami's run game.\n\nThat skill set makes him a potentially interesting fit in Seattle, where new offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb's offenses at the University of Washington relied on a lot of spread fields and could make use of Williams' athleticism.

Williams' agent Drew Rosenhaus had recently claimed that they were in negotiations with Seattle. The sides have now reached an agreement.\n\nWilliams was still available as a free agent because he suffered a season-ending ACL injury as a member of the Miami Dolphins in Week 11 last season. Early indications are that Williams will be healthy once the regular season begins. He'll immediately step into the starting lineup when capable.\n\nPrior to his arrival, the Seahawks had been holding an open competition at center between Nick Harris and Olu Oluwatimi. Both players had been receiving first-team reps with the offense. A healthy Williams projects as an upgrade over both players.\n\nSeahawks offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb said Harris and Oluwatimi were \"doing great\" at center following Tuesday's practice session. \"I think the competition is making them both a lot better,\" Grubb added.\n\nThe Seahawks obviously weren't thrilled with their situation at center. If they were, they wouldn't have pursued Williams with such decisiveness. When healthy, Williams will be the starting center in Seattle. They will need him, as the defensive lines of San Francisco and Los Angeles are still going to be a lethal force to deal with - even without Aaron Donald.\n\nIt should not go unnoticed Williams chose the Seahawks over the AFC runner-ups in the Ravens. Baltimore is obviously a strong contender this year, behind reigning MVP Lamar Jackson, but the fact Williams picked Seattle likely speaks to how he sees potential in what the Seahawks are building under Mike Macdonald.\n\nMore Seahawks Wire stories\n\n4 takeaways from second week of Seahawks training camp\n\n5 biggest Seahawks plays vs Broncos w/ 5 weeks to go until Week 1\n\nSeahawks HC Mike Macdonald sings Byron Murphy's praises\n\nKam Chancellor, Lawyer Milloy and Garry Gilliam visit training camp", "source": {"uri": "seahawkswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Seahawks Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_melo@seahawkswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Justin Melo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Rosenhaus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drew Rosenhaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_lineup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting lineup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Gilliam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garry Gilliam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer_Milloy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer Milloy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Donald", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Donald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kam_Chancellor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kam Chancellor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://seahawkswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/61/2024/07/Connor-Williams-1-1.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793111", "eventUri": "eng-9793111", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Connor Williams, a veteran center who had previously played with the Cowboys and Dolphins, has agreed to a one-year deal worth up to $6 million with the Seahawks, according to ESPN. The deal includes $3 million guaranteed.\n\nWilliams, who spent the last two years in Miami, has been rehabbing from a torn ACL suffered late last season.

He emerged in 2022 and 2023 as one of the league's most athletic centers, and his ability to get out and block in space was key to Miami's run game.\n\nThat skill set makes him an interesting fit in Seattle, where new offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb's offenses at the University of Washington relied on a lot of spread fields and could make use of Williams' athleticism.

(AP) -- The Seattle Seahawks reached agreement on a one-year deal worth up to $6 million with veteran offensive lineman Connor Williams on Tuesday.\n\nWilliams' representatives Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Matha confirmed the agreement to The Associated Press, which includes $3 million guaranteed.\n\nWilliams likely will be thrown into the competition at center where Seattle has the most uncertainty on its offensive line. Olu Oluwatimi, a fifth-round pick in 2023, was the presumptive starter, but Nick Harris has been thrown into the mix in the past week and coach Mike Macdonald said Monday the competition was on between the pair.\n\nWilliams is coming off a season cut short by injury after tearing the ACL in his left knee in Week 14 while playing for Miami. At the time of his injury, Williams was rated as one of the top centers in the NFL by Pro Football Focus.\n\nWilliams visited Seattle at the start of training camp last month.\n\n\"We had a great visit.

Mandatory Credit: Gregory Fisher-USA TODAY Sports / Gregory Fisher-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIn an interesting turn of events, the Baltimore Ravens hosted free agent center Connor Williams for a visit on Monday, ESPN's Adam Schefter reports.\n\nThe surprising part comes in the fact that Williams has been heavily tied to the Seattle Seahawks for multiple days now. In fact, our good friend Corbin K. Smith over at Seattle Seahawks On SI reported on Monday afternoon that it would be \"a major surprise\" if Williams doesn't soon land in Seattle.\n\nDrew Rosenhaus, Williams' agent, also said Monday on the Joe Rose Radio Show that he expects his client to sign \"within the next 48-72 hours.\" Rosenhaus mentioned that \"other teams\" were in the mix, but it's clear that the Seahawks were front and center. Perhaps Williams' visit with Baltimore is a play to get more money from Seattle, but there's also the possiblity that this interest is legitimate.\n\nIt's worth noting that this visit comes right when Pro Bowl center Tyler Linderbaum missed his third-straight practice with a soft tissue concern. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh said Monday that the staff is being \"very careful\" with Linderbaum, and they even used guard Ben Cleveland as a center during practice.\n\n\"He's [Cleveland] been at center now since the first day of OTAs, he's been working in there. He continues to work in there,\" Harbaugh told reporters. \"Tyler is out right now - they're kind of evaluating him - he had some discomfort, and we're going to hold him out. We're going to be very cautious with Tyler, obviously. There is not anything he needs right now in terms of practice, so we'll kind of rest him up there. We're going to work Ben, we're going to work [Andrew] Vorhees in there. We're going to work all of those guys.\"\n\nWilliams, 27, spent the last two seasons with the Miami Dolphins and four with the Dallas Cowboys before that. Unfortunately, he's coming off a torn ACL he suffered in December, which is probably why he's remained on the market for so long.\n\nStill, Williams is a solid lineman who can play a variety of positions, but it's hard to him taking what is likely a backup role in Baltimore over a chance to start in Seattle.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Williams_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connor Williams (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highmark_Stadium_(New_York)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Highmark Stadium (New York)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard_Park_(town),_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orchard Park (town), New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orchard Park (town), New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Rosenhaus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drew Rosenhaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3709,h_2086,x_0,y_122/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/raven_country/01j4j8q18zr6qyv6wxpq.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793111", "eventUri": "eng-9793111", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-01-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

So far, there have been a lot of standouts, but there are also questions that have arisen as well.\n\nOne of the questions involves the depth of the offensive line. It looks as if that question has been at least partially answered. ESPN's Adam Schefter reported Tuesday night that Seattle has signed ex-Dolphins and Cowboys center Connor Williams to a one-year contract.\n\n\"Former Dolphins and Cowboys center Connor Williams reached agreement on a one-year deal worth up to $6 million, including $3M guaranteed, with the Seattle Seahawks,\" Schefter stated via X, formerly Twitter. \"The deal was negotiated and confirmed by Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Mantha.\"\n\nFormer fifth-round pick Olu Oluwatimi was slated to be the starting center heading into this year, but the second-year lineman wasn't performing up to that level. Bringing Williams should help the Seahawks in their chase to return to the postseason. As long as the veteran interior lineman can stay healthy, then he should be able to build a strong relationship over whoever starts at quarterback come Week 1 against the Denver Broncos at home.\n\nConnor Williams, Seahawks look to get back to playoffs\n\nWilliams could work well with Geno Smith or Sam Howell, as he has experience working with all types of quarterbacks. From growing up with Dak Prescott in Dallas to helping Tua Tagovailoa develop in Miami, Williams has turned into a seasoned, knowledgeable veteran at the pivot.\n\nBased on those qualities, one can see why the Seahawks would choose to sign him now that they've seen that Oluwatimi might not be ready to bear the responsibilities that an experienced center takes on.\n\nMacdonald might be in his first season as Seattle's head coach, but he's at least coached at the pro level. His offensive coordinator, Ryan Grubb, has not. He coordinated College Football Playoff runners-up Washington Huskies' offense, but he's never held a coaching position in the NFL.\n\nYes, his attack at Washington was excellent. Yes, it did feature a few 2024 NFL Draft picks, including first-rounders Rome Odunze at wide receiver and quarterback Michael Penix Jr. However, all of that is not a substitute for pro experience. So, it remains to be seen how effective it will be.\n\nComing back to his experience, having a quarterback/center combination featuring Williams would behoove the Seahawks' brass. Macdonald was GM John Schneider's first head coaching hire. He was hired after former head coach Pete Carroll was brought in from USC, so this is his team to run now.

According to a report from ESPN's Adam Schefter, the team hosted free-agent interior lineman Connor Williams for a visit on Monday.\n\nWilliams possesses the positional flexibility and starting experience to play both guard and center. He appeared in 83 career games and has made 77 starts including nearly every contest he has been healthy for dating back to his second year in the league.\n\nOriginally a second-round pick of the Dallas Cowboys in the 2018 NFL Draft, he most recently played for the Miami Dolphins where he started the entire season at center and was a full-time starter this past season until he suffered a torn ACL in early December after nine appearances.\n\nIf signed, Williams would come in and immediately be the Ravens' most experienced interior offensive lineman and insert himself in the running for either of the starting guard vacancies. Although, it seems second-year pro Andrew Vorhees might still be in pole position to be the next left guard regardless of who else is brought in short of an improbable trade for a proven and healthier option.\n\nAn even more immediate need his addition would address is at backup center behind Pro Bowler Tyler Linderbaum who has missed the team's last three practices. Among those in the running now include fourth-year pro Ben Cleveland who is a natural guard heading into a contract year, seventh-round rookie Nick Semac who is recovering from a leg injury of his own, undrafted rookie Darrian Dalcourt and other players currently competing to start at other spots too.\n\n\"It is an open competition right now, and you have Patrick Mekari in that mix, too,\" Harbaugh said Monday. \"We're going to work Ben [Cleveland], we're going to work [Andrew] Vorhees in there. We're going to work all of those guys.\"\n\nSchefter also reported that Williams has received interest from the Seattle Seahawks who poached former Ravens defensive coordinator Mike Macdonald as their new head coach at the onset of the offseason. General manager Eric DeCosta has apparently already extended a deal proposal to Williams who said he \"should make a decision soon\" per reports.\n\nOf the two teams with reported offers on the table, Williams would have the clearest path to seeing the field in Seattle. Their interior offensive line is also in flux but they don't have a Pro Bowl anchor in the middle at center like the Ravens nor do they have definitive starters at guard. However, in Baltimore, he would have a chance to be a part of a true Super Bowl-contending team albeit as a highly valued and coveted backup in a similar fashion to Sam Mustipher last season.\n\nWilliams' agent, Drew Rosenhaus, went on the Joe Rose Radio Show Monday and said he expects his client to sign \"within the next 48-72 hours.\" He also mentioned that other teams are in the mix for the 27-year-old's services but that the Seahawks are leading the pack.", "source": {"uri": "baltimorebeatdown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baltimore Beatdown"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_reed@baltimorebeatdown.com", "name": "Joshua Reed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Vorhees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Vorhees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Linderbaum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Linderbaum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Rosenhaus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drew Rosenhaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9dQbXyJEFCAETP1WhWN8r-9IQDE=/0x0:4185x2093/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25561054/1246189478.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793111", "eventUri": "eng-9793111", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

After weeks of negotiations and free agent intrigue, the team has agreed to terms of a one-year deal with former Miami Dolphins center Connor Williams, according to a report by Adam Schefter at ESPN. The deal includes $3 million in guarantees and is worth up to a total of $6 million.\n\nWilliams gives Seattle's roster a massive boost right where it needed the most help: in the middle of an offensive line that's ranked as one of the worst in the league this year. Thus far this offseason the battle to replace Evan Brown as the team's starting center had taken place between Olu Oluwatimi - who played just 128 snaps as a rookie - and Nick Harris - who has four starts in his NFL career. Signing a more-experienced option was the logical choice.\n\nAdding the proven comoodity that is Williams makes sure that the Seahawks have a solid leader and communicator to lead what is mostly a young and inexperienced offensive line, with the exception of long-time veteran left guard Laken Tomlinson.\n\nLast season Williams only played in nine games before a knee injury cut his season short. However, Pro Football Focus gave him a very strong overall 86.5 grade in 2023, including a 90.5 mark in run blocking, which was the second-best in the league at the position.\n\nThat's an added bonus but what Williams and the rest of Seattle's front five will be primarily judged on is their pass protection - which has been a serious issue each of the last two seasosn with Geno Smith as the starting quarterback. If they can keep him upright long enough for Ryan Grubb's deep passing attack to open up the sky will be the limit for this offense in 2024.\n\nMore Seahawks Wire stories\n\nKen Walker, Riq Woolen scuffle as practices get increasingly scrappy\n\nNFL expert sees 'more teaching' at practice under Mike Macdonald\n\nSeattle Seahawks announce changes to bottom end of edge rotation", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laken_Tomlinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laken Tomlinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geno_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geno Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-07/Connor%20Williams.jpg?itok=Xi-1RJHF", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793111", "eventUri": "eng-9793111", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

That isn't to declare that Oluwatimi isn't good or will never become an NFL-level starter, but Williams has vast starting experience and was playing his best football before his season prematurely ended.\n\nHere are some quick thoughts on this potentially vital addition to Seattle's offensive line.\n\nNot giving out a multi-year deal is fine\n\nThe one perfectly valid reservation regarding Williams is his injury history. He's had torn ACLs both with the Dallas Cowboys and Miami Dolphins. Williams recovered to play every game of the 2020 season after his first ACL tear, and while he's miraculously passed his physical and is in line to play Week 1 after his latest injury, I'd be hesitant to do anything but a \"prove-it\" deal.\n\nWith a contract worth up to $6 million, the upside for Williams is that he could be in line for a significant pay increase if he performs at a high level this season. Ideally, the Seahawks are the ones giving him that long-term extension if he pans out, otherwise we risk the usual wheel o'center offseason.\n\nThis is not an instance of \"signing a veteran to take snaps away from developing players\"\n\nI don't want this signing to be seen as John Schneider bringing in a \"win now\" veteran and blocking a young, inexperienced draft pick like Olu Oluwatimi from playing time. Williams has played six NFL seasons but he is still only 27 years old, and at his best he's considered one of the top centers in the sport.\n\nThis isn't playing Frank Clark over Derick Hall when it was very clear that Clark wasn't good enough anymore, or playing Bruce Irvin over Boye Mafe (although that worked out a bit better). If Oluwatimi doesn't schematically fit Scott Huff's line and/or Ryan Grubb's scheme, then find someone who does. Nick Harris is probably too small to be a starting center and it could be a Joey Hunt redux.\n\nMy suspicion/assumption is that the competition may have been spirited but not to the point of giving the coaching staff any confidence that they're viable starting options. I'd also argue it's a fallacy that rookies and players on rookie contracts are entitled to playing time for the sake of development. If they're not on the field there's usually a valid reason that can be explained by their showings in practice. Sometimes the coaching staff will get it all wrong, but I believe my point still stands.\n\nThe Seahawks signed Williams because he's theoretically in his prime and a better option than anyone on the roster and could help the offense immensely.\n\nSeattle is not going to risk having a wholly inexperienced interior offensive line\n\nWhether Abe Lucas returns in Week 1 or not, the Seahawks have an experienced Charles Cross at left tackle and one of Lucas or the experienced George Fant at right tackle. Laken Tomlinson is not only vastly experienced but he's only missed one game his entire nine-year career. Williams' arrival provides six years of NFL experience and two seasons at center. Right guard is the only question mark with rookie Christian Haynes and second-year player Anthony Bradford.\n\nWhile we'd love to have a fully homegrown offensive line across the board, the Seahawks are clearly aiming for the playoffs and are not going to have their neophytes shoulder so much of the responsibility at positions notorious for needing time to develop. The idea of Christian Haynes (rookie)-Olu Oluwatimi (scarcely played as a rookie)-Anthony Bradford (played 10 games as a rookie) as the interior OL sounds a lot better than what it would most likely look like in reality for 2024.\n\nIf the Seahawks are serious about maximizing Geno Smith's talents and the offense as a whole, signing Williams was a no-brainer. Now we'll see what he has left when he returns to the field in Week 1.\n\nJohn Schneider bided his time, didn't break the bank, and made a much more impactful investment than the B.J.

Both are the case for former Miami Dolphins center and Dallas Cowboys left guard Connor Williams, who currently has several teams vying to sign him in free agency, including the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe latest stop on the Connor Williams free agent world tour was Baltimore, where he met with the Ravens yesterday, according to a report by Adam Schefter at ESPN, who says Williams \"should make a decision soon.\"\n\nCenter isn't generally considered a high-value position in the modern NFL, but that calculus can change really quickly when you don't have a decent starter on the roster. Seattle is one of the teams with nothing more than a couple of question marks at this spot going into the 2024 season.\n\nYesterday the team released their first unofficial depth chart of the season, which shows Olu Oluwatimi still at the top of the rotation ahead of former Washington Huskies lineman Nick Harris. However, after Monday's practice head coach Mike Macdonald made it abundantly clear that the competition at this spot is open - so much that he repeated it several times.\n\nTo these ears it sounds like this battle is little too open. That's why the Seahawks are eager to sign Williams, who has passed a physical after suffering a major knee injury last season.\n\nMost likely Oluwatimi and Harris are competing for the right to be the team's primary backup at this position. If they sign Williams he is practically guaranteed to be the starter come Week 1, even if he only gets a handful of practices in before the game.\n\nMore Seahawks Wire stories\n\nKen Walker, Riq Woolen scuffle as practices get increasingly scrappy\n\nLofa Tatupu compares Devon Witherspoon to an NFL Hall of Famer", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Williams_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Connor Williams (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lofa_Tatupu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lofa Tatupu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Duckpin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Duckpin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-08/GettyImages-1689516736.jpg?itok=yxeiLCUi", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793111", "eventUri": "eng-9793111", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The newest Seahawk is expected to compete with Olu Oluwatimi and Nick Harris to be the team's starting center.\n\n\"Former Dolphins and Cowboys center Connor Williams reached agreement on a one-year deal worth up to $6 million, including $3M guaranteed, with the Seattle Seahawks,\" ESPN's Adam Schefter detailed in an August 6, 2024, message on X. \"The deal was negotiated and confirmed by Drew Rosenhaus and Ryan Matha.\"\n\nWilliams spent his first four NFL seasons as the Dallas Cowboys starting guard. The vet played for the Miami Dolphins over the last two years showing versatility by being utilized at center. Williams has started 77 games over his six NFL seasons.\n\nHere's how Williams will help the Seahawks this season.\n\nWilliams earned an 86.5 grade from Pro Football Focus for his play in 2023. The offensive lineman's availability was likely tied to Williams recovering from an ACL injury.\n\n\"As I said this morning, Connor Williams is not just one of the best centers in football, he was the 2nd best run blocker of ANY offensive lineman last season behind only Penei Sewell,\" Hawk Blogger's Brian Nemhauser noted in an August 6 message on X. \"He was ahead of Trent Williams. Imagine adding Williams run blocking to the middle of your OL.\"\n\nThe good news for Seattle is the team landed Williams on a team-friendly deal that can be worth up to $6 million in 2024, per Schefter. Williams just completed a two-year, $14 million contract with the Dolphins.\n\nSeattle was clearly not pleased with the early returns on Oluwatimi and Harris at center in training camp. Assuming Williams is healthy, the veteran becomes the favorite to be the team's starting center this season.\n\n\"My view of the Connor Williams signing: Seattle has cycled through centers for most of the last decade and couldn't afford to be below average there again, especially with the other OL question marks,\" ESPN's Brady Henderson said in an August 6 post on X. \"Williams has a chance to be the best player they've had at that spot in a while.\"\n\nPrior to Williams signing, Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald was asked about the current state of the interior offensive line. Macdonald did not sound like a coach who has been impressed by the unit so far in training camp. The new Seahawks coach wants to see players solidify their roles as starters.\n\n\"Yeah that would be great [for the position group to be settled],\" Macdonald told Seattle Sports' \"Brock and Salk\" during an August 5, interview. \"That'd be great. I would love someone to just go grab it by the horns and just say, 'I'm the guy at this spot.' I would love that.

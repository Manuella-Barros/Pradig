The hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 am ET.In his most explicit comments since his confirmation in 2020, Garland will tell members of the House Judiciary Committee that recent attacks on the Justice Department \"are unprecedented and unfounded.\"\"Certain members of this Committee and the Oversight Committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining - for no legitimate purpose - sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations,\" Garland will say, according to the prepared remarks.The attorney general was called to Capitol Hill for a hearing on the department's work under his leadership, including efforts to combat violent crime and investigate potential threats to the U.S. stemming from conflicts abroad.But Garland, who is at the center of Republican-led contempt proceedings, is prepared to forcefully push back against his critics.Republicans are moving to try to hold Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio tapes of the president's interview with special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated his handling of classified material and declined to bring charges.The contempt proceedings come \"alongside false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local District Attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department,\" Garland will say according to his remarks, referring to the New York state trial in which Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records.\"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" Garland is expected to say.The attorney general will also allude to other threats stemming from the federal Trump investigations, including \"extremely dangerous falsehoods\" being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations and \"threats to defund particular Department investigations\" like that of special counsel Jack Smith.\"It comes at a time when we are seeing heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants,\" Garland is expected to say. But the long line of attacks \"have not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\"\"I view contempt as a serious matter. But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations,\" Garland's remarks say.\"I will not be intimidated. And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland is expected to slam the \"repeated attacks\" and \"conspiracy\" theories floated by Republicans about the Justice Department being weaponized against former President Donald Trump during his opening statements to Congress on Tuesday, according to prepared remarks shared with CNN.\n\nVideo above: AG Merrick Garland denounces GOP-led attacks on Justice Department\n\nGarland's forceful defense of the department and federal law enforcement will begin what is likely to be a tense, hours-long hearing before members of the House Judiciary Committee. The hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 am ET.\n\nIn his most explicit comments since his confirmation in 2020, Garland will tell members of the House Judiciary Committee that recent attacks on the Justice Department \"are unprecedented and unfounded.\"\n\n\"Certain members of this Committee and the Oversight Committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining - for no legitimate purpose - sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations,\" Garland will say, according to the prepared remarks.\n\nThe attorney general was called to Capitol Hill for a hearing on the department's work under his leadership, including efforts to combat violent crime and investigate potential threats to the U.S. stemming from conflicts abroad.\n\nBut Garland, who is at the center of Republican-led contempt proceedings, is prepared to forcefully push back against his critics.\n\nRepublicans are moving to try to hold Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio tapes of the president's interview with special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated his handling of classified material and declined to bring charges.\n\nThe contempt proceedings come \"alongside false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local District Attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department,\" Garland will say according to his remarks, referring to the New York state trial in which Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records.\n\n\"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" Garland is expected to say.\n\nThe attorney general will also allude to other threats stemming from the federal Trump investigations, including \"extremely dangerous falsehoods\" being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations and \"threats to defund particular Department investigations\" like that of special counsel Jack Smith.\n\n\"It comes at a time when we are seeing heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants,\" Garland is expected to say. But the long line of attacks \"have not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\"\n\n\"I view contempt as a serious matter. But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations,\" Garland's remarks say.\n\n\"I will not be intimidated. And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "4029tv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KHBS/KHOG Channel 40/29"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advice and consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., questions Attorney General Merrick Garland during a House Judiciary Committee hearing on the Department of Justice, Tuesday, June 4, 2024, on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Merrick Garland rebuked what he described as unprecedented attacks on the Justice Department Tuesday, telling Republicans who have sought to hold him in contempt that he will \"not be intimidated.\"\n\nAppearing before a House panel led by allies of former President Donald Trump, Garland condemned the \"conspiracy theory\" that the department was behind Trump's state court prosecution in New York in which the former Republican president was convicted of 34 felony charges. And he pushed back against \"baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods\" being peddled about law enforcement.\n\nGarland's unusually fiery testimony amounted to a forceful defense of independence and integrity of the Justice Department amid an onslaught by Trump and his allies against the U.S. criminal justice system. Garland said the attacks on the Justice Department \"have not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\"\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Garland said. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nHis appearance came as Republicans have moved to hold him in contempt for the Biden administration's refusal to hand over audio of President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur, which focused on the president's handling of classified documents.\n\nA transcript of Biden's interview has been made public, but the president asserted executive privilege over the audio last month to block its release. The White House has said Republican lawmakers only want the audio so they can chop it up and use it for political purposes.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued witnesses might be less likely to cooperate if they know their interviews might become public. Garland told lawmakers he would not \"jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"\n\nRep.

We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nTuesday will mark the first time Garland has appeared before Congress since Trump was convicted by a jury on New York City on 34 counts of falsifying documents.\n\nTrump still faces three other looming criminal cases - two brought by special counsel Jack Smith over his efforts to investigate 2020 election fraud allegations and his post-presidency posssession of classified documents - and a state case in Georgia also tied to his seeking election integrity probes of the 2020 election.\n\nRepublicans have claimed all four cases are politically motivated and represent an effort by Trump's rival President Joe Biden to interfere in the 2024 election Nov. 5.\n\nThey have threatened to defund Smith's two investigations into the former Republican president.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee have also sought to advance contempt proceedings against Garland, after he refused to provide audio recordings of Biden's interview with second special counsel Robert Hur who investigated Biden's retention of classified records and declined to press charges because Biden is a well-meaning old man with cognitive issues that would be a sympathic to a potential jury.\n\nGarland on Tuesday will blast Republicans' demands for the audio, saying their request serves \"no legitimate purpose\" and represents the latest in a string of baseless attacks.\n\n\"It comes alongside threats to defund particular department investigations, most recently the special counsel's prosecution of the former president,\" Garland will testify. \"It comes alongside false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local district attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department. That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself.\"\n\nGarland on Tuesday also plans to defend law enforcement after Trump said the FBI was \"authorized to shoot me\" and was \"locked and loaded\" when it executed a search warrant at his Florida estate in the classified documents probe.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declined to impose a gag order barring Trump from making inflammatory comments that could endanger FBI agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial.\n\nSmith has since renewed his request, and Trump's legal team has until June 14 to respond.\n\nWithout naming Trump, Garland in his prepared testimony will lament the \"baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods\" that are being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations, as well as the \"heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants.\"\n\n\"These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and unfounded,\" he plans to say. \"These attacks have not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_n_lynch@newsmax.com", "name": "Sarah N.

Matt Gaetz, who was investigated by the Justice Department but not charged in a sex trafficking inquiry, had a tense exchange early in the hearing when he demanded to know if the department would produce records related to the New York state case in which Trump was convicted last week.\n\nGarland disputed as false allegations by Gaetz that he had \"dispatched\" to the Manhattan District Attorney office a Justice Department attorney who later became part of the Trump prosecution team, insisting that he had nothing to do with it.\n\nGarland strongly pushed back on Republican questions he said were underpinned by false premises, and Republicans seemed exasperated at some points by his refusal to be drawn into extensive back-and-forth. When at one point, Garland asked for the ability to finish his answer, Rep. Andy Biggs, a conservative Arizona Republican, said no because he was being \"nonresponsive.\"\n\nBut the attorney general also appeared uneasy at some friendly questions from Democrats who tried to underscore the Justice Department's independence by discussing specific cases. Garland refused repeatedly to respond to questions about specific investigations. For example, when one lawmaker asked Garland whether Trump had been interviewed by federal prosecutors before his indictments, he refused to answer, even though the answer is known to be no.",

The hearing is scheduled to begin at 10 am ET.\n\nIn his most explicit comments since his confirmation in 2020, Garland will tell members of the House Judiciary Committee that recent attacks on the Justice Department \"are unprecedented and unfounded.\"\n\n\"Certain members of this Committee and the Oversight Committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining - for no legitimate purpose - sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations,\" Garland will say, according to the prepared remarks.\n\nThe attorney general was called to Capitol Hill for a hearing on the department's work under his leadership, including efforts to combat violent crime and investigate potential threats to the US stemming from conflicts abroad.\n\nBut Garland, who is at the center of Republican-led contempt proceedings, is prepared to forcefully push back against his critics.\n\nRepublicans are moving to try to hold Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over audio tapes of the president's interview with special counsel Robert Hur, who investigated his handling of classified material and declined to bring charges.\n\nThe contempt proceedings come \"alongside false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local District Attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department,\" Garland will say according to his remarks, referring to the New York state trial in which Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records.\n\n\"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" Garland is expected to say.\n\nIn a letter to Garland ahead of Tuesday's hearing, House GOP Reps. Chip Roy, Andy Biggs and Thomas Massie accused the Justice Department of \"aggressive prosecutions of American citizens who were present\" at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and demanded a briefing on the matter.\n\nThe attorney general will also allude to other threats stemming from the federal Trump investigations, including \"extremely dangerous falsehoods\" being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations and \"threats to defund particular Department investigations\" like that of special counsel Jack Smith.\n\n\"It comes at a time when we are seeing heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants,\" Garland is expected to say. But the long line of attacks \"have not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\"\n\n\"I view contempt as a serious matter. But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations,\" Garland's remarks say.\n\n\"I will not be intimidated. And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN's Annie Grayer contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

But \"these attacks have not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\"\n\n\"I view contempt as a serious matter,\" he said. \"But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

Lynch\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland will take aim on Tuesday at Donald Trump's Republican allies in the House of Representatives, where he will accuse them of peddling false narratives that endanger law enforcement and undermine the Justice Department's integrity.\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Garland plans to tell lawmakers before the House Judiciary Committee, according to excerpts of his prepared testimony. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nTuesday will mark the first time Garland has appeared before Congress since Trump was convicted by a jury on New York City on 34 counts of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence an adult film star ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nTrump still faces three other looming criminal cases - two brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents - and a state case in Georgia also tied to his actions in the 2020 election.\n\nRepublicans have claimed all four cases are politically motivated and represent an effort by Trump's rival President Joe Biden to interfere in the 2024 election on Nov. 5.\n\nThey have threatened to defund Smith's two investigations into the former Republican president.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee have also sought to advance contempt proceedings against Garland, after he refused to provide audio recordings of Biden's interview with a second Special Counsel who investigated Biden's retention of classified records and declined to press charges.\n\nGarland on Tuesday will blast Republicans' demands for the audio, saying their request serves \"no legitimate purpose\" and represents the latest in a string of baseless attacks.\n\n\"It comes alongside threats to defund particular department investigations, most recently the Special Counsel's prosecution of the former President,\" Garland will testify. \"It comes alongside false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local District Attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department. That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself.\"\n\nGarland on Tuesday also plans to defend law enforcement from baseless attacks, after Trump falsely claimed the FBI was \"authorized to shoot me\" and was \"locked and loaded\" when it executed a search warrant at his Florida estate in the classified documents probe.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declined to impose a gag order barring Trump from making inflammatory comments that could endanger FBI agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial.\n\nSmith has since renewed his request, and Trump's legal team has until June 14 to respond.\n\nWithout naming Trump, Garland in his prepared testimony will lament the \"baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods\" that are being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations, as well as the \"heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants.\"\n\n\"These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and unfounded,\" he plans to say. \"These attacks have not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sarah N.

The White House has said Republican lawmakers only want the audio so they can chop it up and use it for political purposes.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued witnesses might be less likely to cooperate if they know their interviews might become public.

Prosecutors had previously released the deposition transcript and it remains uncertain whether the contempt vote will be brought to the full House for a vote.\n\nAccording to a portion of Garland's prepared remarks obtained by CBS News, the attorney general is expected to strike a more defiant tone than in past hearings, telling the committee, \"I will not be intimidated. And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has argued handing over the actual recording of Mr. Biden's interview risked chilling future investigations.\n\n\"I view contempt as a serious matter,\" Garland is expected to say Tuesday. \"But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"\n\nThe special counsel, who was appointed by Garland to lead the probe, opted not to charge Mr. Biden as part of the investigation, but criticized his handling of the classified records and questioned whether prosecutors would have been able to convince a jury to convict Mr. Biden, given his age and memory.\n\nIn response to last month's executive privilege claim, Jim Jordan, Chair of the House Judiciary Committee alleged, \"President Biden is asserting executive privilege for the same reason we need the audio recordings -- they offer a unique perspective.\"\n\nThe White House and Mr. Biden rejected Hur's characterizations of the president's recall in the interview and argued the transcript offered a more complete representation of the deposition.\n\nHur is not the only special counsel Garland has appointed in his three years leading the Justice Department, and he is likely not the only independent investigator for whom Garland will have to answer while testifying on Tuesday.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has brought two cases against former President Donald Trump -- one tied to the 2020 election and the other connected to his handling of classified records. Meanwhile, special counsel David Weiss, a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney from Delaware, is currently in the midst of a trial against the president's son, Hunter Biden. He alleged Hunter Biden illegally purchased a firearm while using drugs.\n\nBoth Trump and Hunter Biden have pleaded not guilty, denied wrongdoing and accused the Justice Department of letting politics influence the probes, accusations from both the political right and left that Garland has rebuffed.\n\n\"[The contempt threat] is only the most recent in a long line of attacks on the Justice Department's work,\" the attorney general is expected to tell Congress Tuesday. \"It comes alongside threats to defund particular Department investigations, most recently the Special Counsel's prosecution of the former President.\"\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement ahead of the testimony that Garland will highlight the department's work throughout his tenure and \"forcefully push back on false narratives regarding the Department's employees and their work.\"\n\nThe three years Garland had spent atop the Justice Department have yielded results in what he has said are department priorities, including allegations of war crimes filed in connection with Russia's offensive in Ukraine, antitrust cases brought against corporate giants like Apple and Ticketmaster and efforts to curb violent crime.\n\nStill, Tuesday's testimony from the attorney general and the questions from the panel will likely highlight the partisan political tensions.\n\n\"We are seeing heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants,\" Garland will tell Congress Tuesday.\n\nNotably, he is also expected to address Trump's conviction in New York state court last week on 34 felony counts, calling insinuations from Trump and his supporters that the Justice Department was involved \"false.\"\n\n\"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" Garland will say, according to a copy of his remarks obtained by CBS News.\n\n\"These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and unfounded....These attacks have not -- and they will not -- influence our decision making.\"\n\nOne of the Justice Department's top officials, FBI Director Christopher Wray, is scheduled to appear before a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee hours after the attorney general faces the House committee.\n\nDuring his most recent appearance on Capitol Hill, Wray warned, \"I'd be hard-pressed to think of a time where so many threats to our public safety and national security were so elevated all at once.\" He is likely to reiterate those concerns on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe FBI director told Congress in April the ongoing conflict in Gaza has prompted an increase in threats against the U.S., with the most imminent danger posed by those seeking to carry out attacks on U.S. soil.\n\nDuring that testimony earlier this year, Wray, like Garland, also warned of \"increased threats\" against agents and facilities. \"Having a badge is dangerous enough. It shouldn't also make you a target,\" he said.\n\nSince then, Smith, the special counsel investigating Trump, asked a federal judge to limit the former president's public comments after Trump made false claims that FBI agents were \"authorized to shoot\" him as they executed a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago residence in August 2022. Smith alleged last month that Trump had \"grossly distorted these standard practices by mischaracterizing them as a plan to kill him, his family, and U.S. Secret Service agents.\" His social media posts and campaign emails about the topic, prosecutors wrote, \"pose a significant, imminent, and foreseeable danger to the law enforcement agents.\"\n\nTrump opposed the move and the federal judge overseeing that case has yet to rule on the matter and asked for further briefing in the coming weeks.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI said, \"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive privilege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deposition (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jordan_(American_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Jordan (American politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Appropriations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Appropriations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Lynch\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland will take aim on Tuesday at Donald Trump's Republican allies in the House of Representatives, where he will accuse them of peddling false narratives that endanger law enforcement and undermine the Justice Department's integrity.\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Garland plans to tell lawmakers before the House Judiciary Committee, according to excerpts of his prepared testimony. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence.

That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself.\"\n\nGarland on Tuesday also plans to defend law enforcement from baseless attacks, after Trump falsely claimed the FBI was \"authorized to shoot me\" and was \"locked and loaded\" when it executed a search warrant at his Florida estate in the classified documents probe.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declined to impose a gag order barring Trump from making inflammatory comments that could endanger FBI agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial.\n\nSmith has since renewed his request, and Trump's legal team has until June 14 to respond.\n\nWithout naming Trump, Garland in his prepared testimony will lament the \"baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods\" that are being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations, as well as the \"heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants.\"\n\n\"These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and unfounded,\" he plans to say. \"These attacks have not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sarah N.

That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself.\"\n\nGarland on Tuesday also plans to defend law enforcement from baseless attacks, after Trump falsely claimed the FBI was \"authorized to shoot me\" and was \"locked and loaded\" when it executed a search warrant at his Florida estate in the classified documents probe.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declined to impose a gag order barring Trump from making inflammatory comments that could endanger FBI agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial.\n\nSmith has since renewed his request, and Trump's legal team has until June 14 to respond.\n\nWithout naming Trump, Garland in his prepared testimony will lament the \"baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods\" that are being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations, as well as the \"heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants.\"\n\n\"These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and unfounded,\" he plans to say. \"These attacks have not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sarah N.

The White House has said Republican lawmakers only want the audio so they can chop it up and use it for political purposes.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued witnesses might be less likely to cooperate if they know their interviews might become public. Garland told lawmakers he would not \"jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Garland said. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the committee's top Republican, criticized Garland in his opening statement for a broad array of what he depicted as politically motivated decisions by federal law enforcement -- including the conclusions by different special counsels that Trump criminally mishandled classified documents while Biden did not.\n\n\"Many Americans believe there's now a double standard in our justice system. They believe that because there is,\" Jordan said.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, who was investigated by the Justice Department but not charged in a sex trafficking inquiry, had a tense exchange early in the hearing when he demanded to know if the department would produce records related to the New York state case in which Trump was convicted last week.\n\nGarland disputed as false allegations by Gaetz that he had \"dispatched\" to the Manhattan District Attorney office a Justice Department attorney who later became part of the Trump prosecution team, insisting that he had nothing to do with it.\n\nRate my president: 35% of college students favor Trump, 33% Biden, ahead of November election Rate my president: 35% of college students favor Trump, 33% Biden, ahead of November election Choosing beyond Biden and Trump Trump voters more likely to be men -- and heterosexual Surveyed students share concerns about economy and social policy No shortage of influencers for surveyed students Half of surveyed students don't trust the system Biden supporters have faith in free and fair elections Tags Wire Dcc Apmediaapi Merrick Garland Congress Republicans Justice Department Legal Proceedings Politics Washington News General News Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "dothaneagle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dothan Eagle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "eric_tucker@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Eric Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "alanna_durkin_richer@dothaneagle.com", "name": "Alanna Durkin Richer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and unfounded.\"\n\nGarland is expected to further stand by the Justice Department's recent decision to urge Biden to assert executive privilege over the remaining records from Hur's investigation, arguing that handing over the materials could have the impact of jeopardizing future high-profile investigations.\n\n\"I view contempt as a serious matter.

Garland emphasized that the Justice Department remains free from political influence, and dismissed Republican assertions as dangerous conspiracy theories that could jeopardize federal law enforcement. He vowed to continue defending democracy.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday rejected accusations by House Republicans that he had politicized the criminal justice system in a bid to stop Donald Trump from reclaiming the White House. In strongly worded testimony, Garland told lawmakers he would not allow politics to interfere with the Justice Department's independent criminal investigations, and he accused them of peddling conspiracy theories that could endanger federal law enforcement officers.\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Garland told lawmakers before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\" Tuesday marked the first time Garland has appeared before Congress since a Manhattan jury convicted Republican presidential candidate and former President Trump on 34 counts of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump still faces three other state or federal criminal cases - two brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents - and a state case in Georgia also tied to his actions in the 2020 White House race. Republicans have claimed all four cases are politically motivated and represent an effort by Trump's rival, President Joe Biden, to interfere in the Nov. 5, 2024, election.\n\nThey have threatened to defund Smith's two investigations into Trump. The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee have also sought to advance contempt proceedings against Garland, after he refused to provide audio recordings of Biden's interview with a second special counsel who investigated Biden's retention of classified records and declined to press charges.\n\nIf Trump wins a second White House term in November, his allies have pledged to stack the Justice Department with loyalists who will do his bidding. Trump has said he wants to use the department to pursue his own political rivals - the very thing Republicans now accuse the Justice Department of doing. \"Many Americans believe there is now a double standard in our justice system,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan said on Tuesday. \"They believe that because there is.\"\n\nGarland blasted Republicans for threatening to defund Smith's investigation, and also accused them of making \"false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local district attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department. \" \"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" he added.\n\nGarland's comments, however, did not deter some Republicans from repeating their theory that the New York case was somehow being controlled behind the scenes by the Justice Department, without presenting any evidence. Congressman Matt Gaetz on Tuesday repeatedly asked Garland whether he had \"dispatched\" former Justice Department official Matthew Colangelo to work with the team of New York City prosecutors who tried the case against Trump.\n\nColangelo, who left the department to work for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, gave the opening statement in Trump's criminal trial. \"It's false,\" Garland replied. \"I did not dispatch Mr. Colangelo anywhere.\"\n\nDemocrats on Tuesday defended the Justice Department, noting that it is currently prosecuting three prominent members of their own political party: U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar, Senator Bob Menendez and President Joe Biden's son Hunter, whose criminal trial started this week. Garland on Tuesday also defended law enforcement from baseless attacks, after Trump falsely claimed the FBI was \"authorized to shoot me\" and was \"locked and loaded\" when it executed a search warrant at his Florida estate in the classified documents probe.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declined to impose a gag order barring Trump from making inflammatory comments that could endanger FBI agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial. Smith has since renewed his request, and Trump's legal team has until June 14 to respond.\n\nWithout naming Trump, Garland lamented the \"baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods\" that are being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations, as well as the \"heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants.\" \"These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and unfounded,\" he said. \"These attacks have not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\"", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

Trump was not home when the FBI executed the search.\n\n\"WOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nTrump's legal team also made a court filing citing the use of force authorization by the DOJ.\n\nBut the use of force that Trump's team cited in the court filing is the standard language used by the DOJ for years, and the same language was used when FBI agents searched President Biden's home for classified documents.\n\nGarland will say in his testimony that the effort to hold him in contempt \"comes as baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods are being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations.\"\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith said Trump's team omitted the key word \"only\" in the filing in late May that led to Trump's accusations that the FBI was prepared to kill him.\n\n\"Although Trump included the warrant and Operations Form as exhibits to his motion, the motion misquoted the Operations Form by omitting the crucial word 'only' before 'when necessary,' without any ellipsis reflecting the omission,\" Smith wrote. \"The motion also left out language explaining that deadly force is necessary only 'when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.'\"\n\nHOW TRUMP GUILTY VERDICTS MAY IMPACT THE 2024 REMATCH WITH BIDEN\n\nTrump's team was given until June 14 to reply to a move by Smith to issue a gag order prohibiting Trump from making statements about the FBI.\n\nSmith and Garland said Trump's statements put law enforcement in danger.\n\nGarland will also testify against claims coming from Republicans that the DOJ had any involvement in the hush money case against Trump in New York, where the former president was convicted on 34 counts for falsifying business records.\n\nThe New York case was brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, not the DOJ. It is a state case, which means Trump could not pardon himself if he wins the presidential election.\n\nThe measure to hold Garland in contempt \"comes alongside false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local District Attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department,\" Garland will say in his testimony. \"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself.\"\n\nGarland will say the measure \"is only the most recent in a long line of attacks on the Justice Department's work.\"\n\n\"It comes alongside threats to defund particular Department investigations, most recently the Special Counsel's prosecution of the former president,\" Garland says.\n\nTRUMP GUILTY VERDICT REVEALS SPLIT AMONG FORMER GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY OPPONENTS\n\nHe said it also comes as individual career agents and prosecutors \"have been singled out just for doing their jobs\" and at a time \"when we are seeing heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants.\"\n\nGarland says these \"repeated attacks\" on the DOJ's are \"unprecedented and unfounded\" and that the attacks will not influence the department's decision-making.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I view contempt as a serious matter,\" Garland says. \"But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" he adds. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated.

Hur's investigation into President Biden's handling of classified materials.\n\nBiden last month exerted executive privilege to keep the recordings from public view after Garland requested he do so over concerns that releasing them could harm future efforts to get officials to cooperate with investigations and sit for taped interviews.\n\n\"Certain members of this Committee and the Oversight Committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining - for no legitimate purpose - sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations,\" Garland plans to tell lawmakers at the hearing, according to excerpts of his opening remarks released by his office. \"This effort is only the most recent in a long line of attacks on the Justice Department's work.\"\n\nIn a letter to the House Republicans last month, the White House said transcripts of the Biden interviews with Hur have already been provided to lawmakers and accused Republicans of wanting to \"distort\" the recordings for political gain. Hur concluded in a lengthy report last fall that no criminal charges were warranted against Biden for his handling of classified materials after leaving the White House as vice president in 2017.\n\nBut Hur sharply criticized Biden's age, which Republicans used to amplify political attacks against the president as unfit for a second term.\n\nGOP leaders called Hur's investigation politically compromised and railed against federal charges filed by another special counsel, Jack Smith, alleging that former president Donald Trump improperly kept classified documents after leaving the White House in 2021 and failed to heed requests from investigators to return them.\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said Garland intends to push back against \"false narratives regarding the Department's employees and their work.\"\n\nIn his prepared remarks, Garland plans to say: \"I view contempt as a serious matter.

Chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on Monday called for eliminating federal funding for state prosecutors engaged in \"abusive 'lawfare' tactics to target political opponents.\"\n\nGarland on Tuesday will call such claims a \"conspiracy theory [that] is an attack on the judicial process itself.\"\n\nAnd though Republicans already have a transcript of President Biden's conversation with special counsel Robert Hur, lawmakers are sure to ask questions about the interview as well as the decision not to turn over audio recordings of the conversation. They are also likely to ask him about DOJ investigations into Hunter Biden, who faces trial this week.\n\n\"Certain members of this Committee and the Oversight Committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining -- for no legitimate purpose -- sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations,\" Garland will say, according to prepared remarks obtained by The Hill.\n\n\"I view contempt as a serious matter.

And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nPresident Biden claimed executive privilege over the audio on the eve of the committees' meetings to vote over whether to hold Garland in contempt - a detail that provides the attorney general cover from having to turn over the files.\n\nThe GOP's interest in holding Garland in contempt comes, they say, as an offshoot of their impeachment investigation.\n\nBoth Judiciary and the House Oversight Committee sent subpoenas to Garland asking a series of questions seeking to tie the conversation about President Biden's classified documents probe back to their own investigation about influence peddling.\n\nRepublicans argue they need the audio for a broader investigation into whether Biden was involved in his family's business dealings. They say it may shed light on whether Biden took action to limit prosecution of his son, or whether he sought to limit the scope of questions asked of him.\n\nBut the suggestions are far afield of Hur's work, and the transcript of both day's interviews makes clear these topics were not discussed.\n\n\"Nothing in the interview transcripts the department has already produced speaks to or supports the committees' speculation on this point, and nothing in the audio file of the same conversations would do so either,\" Carlos Uriarte, head of the DOJ's office of legislative affairs, wrote to the two committee chairs repeatedly in an 11-page letter in April.\n\nDemocrats have accused Republicans of wanting the audio to use for campaign commercials.\n\nRepublicans' linking of Hur's investigation with their own follows the arrest of a former FBI informant who accused Biden of accepting a bribe, an allegation underlying the GOP probe. The informant has since been charged in relation with fabricating the claim.\n\nWhen lawmakers met last month to vote on the Garland contempt resolution, the House Oversight hearing was overshadowed by conflicts between members, after by being rescheduled in order to allow Republicans to go to the Trump trial. Lawmakers instead traded insults over one another's appearance after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) mocked another lawmaker's false eyelashes.\n\nGarland on Tuesday also plans to address \"threats to defund particular Department investigations\" - a group he notes includes special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nWithout naming names or nodding to committee investigations into line agents, Garland also notes a rise in individual career agents being singled out \"just for doing their jobs\"\n\n\"It comes as baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods are being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations. And it comes at a time when we are seeing heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants,\" he says in the remarks.\n\n\"These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and unfounded.

In a passionate testimony, Garland ensured that political influence would not interfere with the Justice Department's activities and condemned conspiracy theories as threats to federal law enforcement.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday rejected accusations by House Republicans that he had politicized the criminal justice system in a bid to stop Donald Trump from reclaiming the White House. In defiant testimony, Garland told lawmakers he would not allow politics to interfere with the Justice Department's independent criminal investigations, and he accused them of peddling conspiracy theories that could endanger federal law enforcement officers.\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Garland told lawmakers before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\" Tuesday marked the first time Garland has appeared before Congress since a Manhattan jury convicted Republican presidential candidate and former President Trump on 34 counts of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump still faces three other state or federal criminal cases - two brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents - and a state case in Georgia also tied to his actions in the 2020 White House race. Republicans have claimed all four cases are politically motivated and represent an effort by Trump's rival, President Joe Biden, to interfere in the Nov. 5, 2024 election.\n\nThey have threatened to defund Smith's two investigations into Trump. The Republican-led House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee have also sought to advance contempt proceedings against Garland, after he refused to provide audio recordings of Biden's interview with a second special counsel who investigated Biden's retention of classified records and declined to press charges.\n\nIf Trump wins a second term in November, his allies have pledged to stack the Justice Department with loyalists who will do his bidding. Trump has said he wants to use the department to pursue his own political rivals - the very thing Republicans now accuse the Justice Department of doing. \"Many Americans believe there is now a double standard in our justice system,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio said on Tuesday. \"They believe that because there is.\"\n\nGarland blasted Republicans for threatening to defund Smith's investigation, and also accused them of making \"false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local district attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department.\" \"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" he added.\n\nSome Republicans on the committee nonetheless repeated their theory that the New York case was behind the scenes by the Justice Department, without presenting any evidence. Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida on Tuesday repeatedly asked Garland whether he had \"dispatched\" former Justice Department official Matthew Colangelo to work with the New York City prosecutors.\n\nColangelo, who left the department to work for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, gave the opening statement in Trump's criminal trial. \"It's false,\" Garland replied. \"I did not dispatch Mr. Colangelo anywhere.\"\n\n'IF YOU COMMIT CRIMES, YOU WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE' Democrats defended the Justice Department, noting that it is currently prosecuting two Democratic lawmakers - U.S. Senator Bob Menendez and Representative Henry Cuellar and - as well as Democratic President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden, whose criminal trial started this week.\n\n\"You can be the former president of the United States, but if you commit crimes, you will be held responsible. That's his problem,\" said Democratic congressman Adam Schiff of California. \"That's the problem of all of my Republican colleagues right now, and that is they're about to nominate a convicted felon, and they don't know how to cope with that.\"\n\nRepublicans are expected to nominate Trump as their presidential candidate at next month's convention. Garland also defended law enforcement from baseless attacks, after Trump falsely claimed the FBI was \"authorized to shoot me\" when it executed a search warrant at his Florida estate in the classified documents probe.\n\nGarland lamented the \"baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods\" that are being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations.\"\n\n(This story has not been

The case was brought by Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who, as a local prosecutor, is not under the control of Biden or his administration.\n\n\"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" Garland said in an opening statement to the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nHis remarks amounted to a vigorous defense of the department as Trump and his allies have escalated their attacks on law enforcement after his conviction in Manhattan court last week and as the former president has been shadowed by other criminal cases.\n\nAmong Trump's more extraordinary claims in recent weeks was the highly misleading statement that the Biden administration was prepared to kill him when the FBI conducted a court-ordered search of his Mar-a-Lago estate in 2022 to retrieve classified documents.\n\n\"This is dangerous,\" Garland said in response to a question by Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., about the consequences of such an assertion. The claim, the attorney general said, distorted a standard Justice Department use-of-force policy that had also applied to a search of President Joe Biden's Delaware home.\n\n\"It raises the threats of violence against prosecutors and career agents,\" Garland said. \"The allegation is false.\"\n\nThe committee and the House Oversight Committee recommended last month holding Garland in contempt for refusing to turn over audio recordings of interviews that Robert K. Hur, the special counsel, conducted with Biden last year. Hur ultimately cleared Biden of criminal wrongdoing over his retention of classified material, despite faulting his memory and handling of sensitive documents.

They have yet to schedule a floor vote.\n\nGarland said at the time that the bid by Republicans was the latest in \"a series of unprecedented and, frankly, unfounded attacks\" on the department and the rule of law.\n\nGarland told Republicans today that those efforts were feeding \"heinous\" threats against individual career agents and prosecutors.\n\n\"These attacks have not, and they will not, influence our decision-making,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu Star Advertiser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Nadler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Nadler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

The contempt effort has been left in limbo, as it's unclear whether the GOP will be able to secure enough votes to pass the measure on the full floor.\n\nIt's a busy time for Garland to appear before some of the House's biggest bomb throwers, though a spokesperson for the DOJ said ahead of the hearing that the attorney general planned to \"forcefully push back on false narratives regarding the Department's employees and their work.\"\n\nNumerous Republicans have vented frustration toward the DOJ over former President Donald Trump's conviction by a New York jury, although the agency has no control over state-level prosecutions.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Monday called for eliminating federal funding for state prosecutors engaged in \"abusive 'lawfare' tactics to target political opponents.\"\n\nGarland expected to push back Tuesday\n\nGarland on Tuesday called such claims a \"conspiracy theory (that) is an attack on the judicial process itself.\"\n\nRep.

They say it may shed light on whether Biden took action to limit prosecution of his son, or whether he sought to limit the scope of questions asked of him.\n\nDemocrats have accused Republicans of wanting the audio to be used for campaign commercials.", "source": {"uri": "cenlanow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WNTZ - cenlanow.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewsNation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NewsNation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

The interview was part of the investigation into Biden's handling of classified material, and Hur ultimately decided not to bring charges, angering the president's critics.\n\nThe White House had asserted executive privilege over the recording of the interview, sending a letter to House Oversight Chair James Comer (R-KY) and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) arguing there was no \"legitimate need\" for \" such sensitive and constitutionally-protected law enforcement materials\" to be released and Republicans clearly intended to \"manipulate\" them for \"partisan political purposes.\" According to the letter, Garland himself recommended to the president that he exert executive privilege over the recording because of his concern that other government officials would be less inclined to cooperate with investigations in the future.\n\nGarland began his opening remarks at Tuesday morning's hearing listing several recent accomplishments of the DOJ, including arrests made in various investigations, efforts made to protect voting rights, fraud prosecutions, and actions taken against alleged monopolies like Live Nation and Apple.\n\nHe specifically called out those who threaten public officials with violence -- including those who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"Let me be clear,\" said Garland, \"if anyone threatens public servants with violence, we will hold them accountable, and we will continue to protect our democratic institutions like this one.\"\n\nGarland vowed that as attorney general he \"will continue to forcefully defend the independence of the Justice Department from improper influence or interference of any kind,\" and \"will continue to fiercely protect the integrity of our criminal investigations.\"\n\nHe emphasized that while the DOJ was willing to comply with the committee's \"legitimate requests for information,\" the transcript of Biden's testimony was sufficient, and the audio recordings would not be released, citing again the concern about how it could influence future witnesses' participation.\n\nGarland denounced accusations Republicans were making about former President Donald Trump's conviction for 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in his hush money trial as \"false claims,\" noting that the conviction was from \"a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local District Attorney,\" and not under the control of the DOJ.\n\n\"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" Garland declared, and was comprised of \"baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods,\" putting at risk the individual career agents and prosecutors who were being \"singled out just for doing their jobs\" and being subjected to \"heinous threats of violence.\"\n\n\"These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and they are unfounded,\" he continued. \"These attacks have not, and they will not, influence our decision-making.\"\n\n\"I view contempt as a serious matter,\" said Garland, \"but I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" he concluded. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated.

Lynch\n\nWASHINGTON, June 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday rejected accusations by House Republicans that he had politicized the criminal justice system in a bid to stop Donald Trump from reclaiming the White House.\n\nIn strongly worded testimony, Garland told lawmakers he would not allow politics to interfere with the Justice Department's independent criminal investigations, and he accused them of peddling conspiracy theories that could endanger federal law enforcement officers.\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Garland told lawmakers before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nTuesday marked the first time Garland has appeared before Congress since a Manhattan jury convicted Republican presidential candidate and former President Trump on 34 counts of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump still faces three other state or federal criminal cases - two brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents - and a state case in Georgia also tied to his actions in the 2020 White House race.\n\nRepublicans have claimed all four cases are politically motivated and represent an effort by Trump's rival, President Joe Biden, to interfere in the Nov. 5, 2024, election.\n\nThey have threatened to defund Smith's two investigations into Trump.\n\nThe Republican-led House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee have also sought to advance contempt proceedings against Garland, after he refused to provide audio recordings of Biden's interview with a second special counsel who investigated Biden's retention of classified records and declined to press charges.\n\nIf Trump wins a second White House term in November, his allies have pledged to stack the Justice Department with loyalists who will do his bidding. Trump has said he wants to use the department to pursue his own political rivals - the very thing Republicans now accuse the Justice Department of doing.\n\n\"Many Americans believe there is now a double standard in our justice system,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan said on Tuesday. \"They believe that because there is.\"\n\nGarland blasted Republicans for threatening to defund Smith's investigation, and also accused them of making \"false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local district attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department. \"\n\n\"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" he added.\n\nGarland's comments, however, did not deter some Republicans from repeating their theory that the New York case was somehow being controlled behind the scenes by the Justice Department, without presenting any evidence.\n\nCongressman Matt Gaetz on Tuesday repeatedly asked Garland whether he had \"dispatched\" former Justice Department official Matthew Colangelo to work with the team of New York City prosecutors who tried the case against Trump.\n\nColangelo, who left the department to work for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, gave the opening statement in Trump's criminal trial.\n\n\"It's false,\" Garland replied. \"I did not dispatch Mr. Colangelo anywhere.\"\n\nDemocrats on Tuesday defended the Justice Department, noting that it is currently prosecuting three prominent members of their own political party: U.S. Representative Henry Cuellar, Senator Bob Menendez and President Joe Biden's son Hunter, whose criminal trial started this week.\n\nGarland on Tuesday also defended law enforcement from baseless attacks, after Trump falsely claimed the FBI was \"authorized to shoot me\" and was \"locked and loaded\" when it executed a search warrant at his Florida estate in the classified documents probe.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declined to impose a gag order barring Trump from making inflammatory comments that could endanger FBI agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial.\n\nSmith has since renewed his request, and Trump's legal team has until June 14 to respond.\n\nWithout naming Trump, Garland lamented the \"baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods\" that are being spread about the FBI\u00b4s law enforcement operations, as well as the \"heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants.\"\n\n\"These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and unfounded,\" he said. \"These attacks have not, and they will not, influence our decision making.\" (Reporting by Sarah N.

Garland told GOP lawmakers that the Justice Department will not be shaken.\n\n\"We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy,\" said Garland in the statement.\n\n\"Certain members of this Committee and the Oversight Committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining - for no legitimate purpose - sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations,\" Garland said at the opening of the hearing, CNN reported.\n\nTuesday's hearing will be the first time that the attorney general has appeared before Congress from the time that the former president was convicted by a jury in New York on 34 counts of falsification of documents. Aside from these, there are still three more cases that Trump needs to deal with.\n\nThe two cases about Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 elections and mishandling of classified docs were brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith. The other is in Georgia, a state case still related to actions during the 2020 election.\n\nRepublicans have called the string of cases that Trump is facing as \"politically motivated.\" They also accuse President Joe Biden as the one responsible for the cases, stating that these are efforts to interfere with the November elections. They have already threatened defunding the two investigations by Smith.\n\nRepublicans have also wanted to put forward contempt proceedings against Garland after he refused to submit audio recordings of an interview of Biden with a second Special Counsel.\n\n\"It comes alongside threats to defund particular department investigations, most recently the Special Counsel's prosecution of the former President,\" Garland testified.\n\n\"It comes alongside false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local District Attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department.

Trump was not home when the FBI executed the search.\n\n\"WOW! I just came out of the Biden Witch Hunt Trial in Manhattan, the 'Icebox,' and was shown Reports that Crooked Joe Biden's DOJ, in their illegal and UnConstitutional Raid of Mar-a-Lago, AUTHORIZED THE FBI TO USE DEADLY (LETHAL) FORCE,\" Trump also wrote on Truth Social.\n\nTrump's legal team also made a court filing citing the use of force authorization by the DOJ.\n\nBut the use of force that Trump's team cited in the court filing is the standard language used by the DOJ for years, and the same language was used when FBI agents searched President Biden's home for classified documents.\n\nGarland will say in his testimony that the effort to hold him in contempt \"comes as baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods are being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations.\"\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith said Trump's team omitted the key word \"only\" in the filing in late May that led to Trump's accusations that the FBI was prepared to kill him.\n\n\"Although Trump included the warrant and Operations Form as exhibits to his motion, the motion misquoted the Operations Form by omitting the crucial word 'only' before 'when necessary,' without any ellipsis reflecting the omission,\" Smith wrote. \"The motion also left out language explaining that deadly force is necessary only 'when the officer has a reasonable belief that the subject of such force poses an imminent danger of death or serious physical injury to the officer or to another person.'\"\n\nHOW TRUMP GUILTY VERDICTS MAY IMPACT THE 2024 REMATCH WITH BIDEN\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon denied Smith's request to restrict Trump's speech about law enforcement involved in the case after defense attorneys called it \"unconstitutional censorship.\" Cannon found that Smith's prosecutors failed to properly confer with Trump's lawyers before filing the motion, in violation of court rules.\n\nSmith and Garland said Trump's statements put law enforcement in danger.\n\nGarland will also testify against claims coming from Republicans that the DOJ had any involvement in the hush money case against Trump in New York, where the former president was convicted on 34 counts for falsifying business records.\n\nThe New York case was brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, not the DOJ. It is a state case, which means Trump could not pardon himself if he wins the presidential election.\n\nThe measure to hold Garland in contempt \"comes alongside false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local District Attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department,\" Garland will say in his testimony. \"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself.\"\n\nGarland will say the measure \"is only the most recent in a long line of attacks on the Justice Department's work.\"\n\n\"It comes alongside threats to defund particular Department investigations, most recently the Special Counsel's prosecution of the former president,\" Garland says.\n\nTRUMP GUILTY VERDICT REVEALS SPLIT AMONG FORMER GOP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY OPPONENTS\n\nHe said it also comes as individual career agents and prosecutors \"have been singled out just for doing their jobs\" and at a time \"when we are seeing heinous threats of violence being directed at the Justice Department's career public servants.\"\n\nGarland says these \"repeated attacks\" on the DOJ's are \"unprecedented and unfounded\" and that the attacks will not influence the department's decision-making.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I view contempt as a serious matter,\" Garland says. \"But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" he adds. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_spunt@foxnews.com", "name": "David

Lynch\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland on Tuesday rejected accusations by House Republicans that he had politicized the criminal justice system in a bid to stop Donald Trump from reclaiming the White House.\n\nIn defiant testimony, Garland told lawmakers he would not allow politics to interfere with the Justice Department's independent criminal investigations, and he accused them of peddling conspiracy theories that could endanger federal law enforcement officers.\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Garland told lawmakers before the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nTuesday marked the first time Garland has appeared before Congress since a Manhattan jury convicted Republican presidential candidate and former President Trump on 34 counts of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence a porn star before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump still faces three other state or federal criminal cases - two brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents - and a state case in Georgia also tied to his actions in the 2020 White House race.\n\nRepublicans have claimed all four cases are politically motivated and represent an effort by Trump's rival, President Joe Biden, to interfere in the Nov. 5, 2024 election.\n\nThey have threatened to defund Smith's two investigations into Trump.\n\nThe Republican-led House Judiciary Committee and the House Oversight Committee have also sought to advance contempt proceedings against Garland, after he refused to provide audio recordings of Biden's interview with a second special counsel who investigated Biden's retention of classified records and declined to press charges.\n\nIf Trump wins a second term in November, his allies have pledged to stack the Justice Department with loyalists who will do his bidding. Trump has said he wants to use the department to pursue his own political rivals - the very thing Republicans now accuse the Justice Department of doing.\n\n\"Many Americans believe there is now a double standard in our justice system,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan of Ohio said on Tuesday. \"They believe that because there is.\"\n\nGarland blasted Republicans for threatening to defund Smith's investigation, and also accused them of making \"false claims that a jury verdict in a state trial, brought by a local district attorney, was somehow controlled by the Justice Department.\"\n\n\"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" he added.\n\nSome Republicans on the committee nonetheless repeated their theory that the New York case was behind the scenes by the Justice Department, without presenting any evidence.\n\nCongressman Matt Gaetz of Florida on Tuesday repeatedly asked Garland whether he had \"dispatched\" former Justice Department official Matthew Colangelo to work with the New York City prosecutors.\n\nColangelo, who left the department to work for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, gave the opening statement in Trump's criminal trial.\n\n\"It's false,\" Garland replied. \"I did not dispatch Mr. Colangelo anywhere.\"\n\n'IF YOU COMMIT CRIMES, YOU WILL BE HELD RESPONSIBLE'\n\nDemocrats defended the Justice Department, noting that it is currently prosecuting two Democratic lawmakers - U.S. Senator Bob Menendez and Representative Henry Cuellar and - as well as Democratic President Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden, whose criminal trial started this week.\n\n\"You can be the former president of the United States, but if you commit crimes, you will be held responsible. That's his problem,\" said Democratic congressman Adam Schiff of California.\n\n\"That's the problem of all of my Republican colleagues right now, and that is they're about to nominate a convicted felon, and they don't know how to cope with that.\"\n\nRepublicans are expected to nominate Trump as their presidential candidate at next month's convention.\n\nGarland also defended law enforcement from baseless attacks, after Trump falsely claimed the FBI was \"authorized to shoot me\" when it executed a search warrant at his Florida estate in the classified documents probe.\n\nGarland lamented the \"baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods\" that are being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sarah N.

The contempt effort has been left in limbo, as it's unclear whether the GOP will be able to secure enough votes to pass the measure on the full floor.\n\nIt's a busy time for Garland to appear before some of the House's biggest bomb throwers, though a spokesperson for the DOJ said the attorney general plans to \"forcefully push back on false narratives regarding the Department's employees and their work.\"\n\nNumerous Republicans have vented frustration toward the DOJ over former President Donald Trump's conviction by a New York jury despite the fact that the agency has no control over state-level prosecutions.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, on Monday called for eliminating federal funding for state prosecutors engaged in \"abusive 'lawfare' tactics to target political opponents.\"\n\nGarland expected to push back Tuesday\n\nGarland on Tuesday will call such claims a \"conspiracy theory (that) is an attack on the judicial process itself.\"\n\nRep. Laurel Lee, R-Fla., said Tuesday on \"Morning in America\" that the big picture for the hearing is to address the \"weaponization\" of government.\n\n\"One of the most important things that we can do in Congress is make sure we are conducting oversight,\" Lee said. \"The big picture here is the question about weaponization of government and whether two people -- namely President Trump and President Biden -- who have committed similar acts are being treated the same way by our justice system.\"\n\nBiden's impeachment investigation\n\nThe GOP's interest in holding Garland in contempt comes, they say, as an offshoot of their impeachment investigation.\n\nBoth Judiciary and the House Oversight Committee sent subpoenas to Garland asking a series of questions seeking to tie the conversation about President Joe Biden's classified documents probe back to their own investigation about influence peddling.\n\nBiden claimed executive privilege over the audio recordings of his interviews with Hur on the eve of the committees' meetings to vote over whether to hold Garland in contempt -- a detail that provides the attorney general cover from having to turn over the files.\n\nRepublicans argue they need the audio for a broader investigation into whether Biden was involved in his family's business dealings. They say it may shed light on whether Biden took action to limit prosecution of his son, or whether he sought to limit the scope of questions asked of him.\n\nDemocrats have accused Republicans of wanting the audio to use for campaign commercials.", "source": {"uri": "myfox8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "myfox8.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Oversight_and_Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has criticized Garland for refusing to release the recording of President Joe Biden discussing the classified documents found at his home with special counsel Robert Hur. Jordan proposed Monday to eliminate funding for for a new FBI headquarters and for special counsel Jack Smith, who is prosecuting former President Donald Trump for attempting to overturn the 2020 election and for retaining and refusing to return classified documents after leaving office.\n\nBut Garland, a former federal prosecutor and appeals court judge, plans to say in prepared remarks at a 10 a.m. Judiciary Committee hearing that he wouldn't be intimidated by the move to hold him in contempt. The department provided lawmakers with a transcript of the interview, but said releasing the recording could jeopardize future investigations. Biden invoked executive privilege to keep the recording confidential.\n\n\"These repeated attacks on the Justice Department are unprecedented and unfounded,\" Garland is expected to say. \"I view contempt as a serious matter. But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations. I will not be intimidated.\"\n\nGarland will also slam Republicans for \"false claims\" that Trump's conviction for falsifying business records in New York state court \"was somehow controlled by the Justice Department.\"\n\n\"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" Garland said in the prepared remarks.\n\nHur decided not to charge Biden with any crimes for the classified documents found in his former Washington, D.C. office and Delaware home, saying the evidence did not establish his guilt \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Hur's report also described Biden as a \"well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.\"\n\nHouse Republicans argued they needed to hear the recording to gauge Biden's capacity to hold office. The Judiciary and Oversight committees voted in May to hold Garland in contempt for refusing to turn over the recording.\n\nIf the full House votes to hold Garland in contempt for refusing to turn over the recording, the move is largely symbolic because the department is unlikely to prosecute the attorney general.\n\n\"These attacks have not, and they will not, influence our decision making,\" Garland said.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: AG Garland to House GOP: 'I won't be intimidated' by contempt threat", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bart_jansen@aol.com", "name": "Bart Jansen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

The White House has said Republican lawmakers only want the audio so they can chop it up and use it for political purposes.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued witnesses might be less likely to cooperate if they know their interviews might become public. Garland told lawmakers he would not \"jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Garland said. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the committee's top Republican, criticized Garland in his opening statement for a broad array of what he depicted as politically motivated decisions by federal law enforcement -- including the conclusions by different special counsels that Trump criminally mishandled classified documents while Biden did not.\n\n\"Many Americans believe there's now a double standard in our justice system. They believe that because there is,\" Jordan said.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, who was investigated by the Justice Department but not charged in a sex trafficking inquiry, had a tense exchange early in the hearing when he demanded to know if the department would produce records related to the New York state case in which Trump was convicted last week.\n\nGarland disputed as false allegations by Gaetz that he had \"dispatched\" to the Manhattan District Attorney office a Justice Department attorney who later became part of the Trump prosecution team, insisting that he had nothing to do with it.\n\nRate my president: 35% of college students favor Trump, 33% Biden, ahead of November election Rate my president: 35% of college students favor Trump, 33% Biden, ahead of November election Choosing beyond Biden and Trump Trump voters more likely to be men -- and heterosexual Surveyed students share concerns about economy and social policy No shortage of influencers for surveyed students Half of surveyed students don't trust the system Biden supporters have faith in free and fair elections\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Garland, facing a contempt vote in Congress, will lash out at House Republicans on Tuesday, accusing his critics of seeking to undermine the rule of law, peddling \"conspiracy theories\" and spreading falsehoods, according to his prepared remarks.\n\nThe usually mild-mannered Mr. Garland is expected to push back against the false accusation that the Justice Department was somehow behind the prosecution and subsequent conviction of former President Donald J. Trump on state charges.\n\n\"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" he is expected to say in testimony he will deliver to the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe committee and the House Oversight Committee recommended last month holding Mr. Garland in contempt for refusing to turn over audio recordings of interviews that Robert K. Hur, the special counsel, did with President Biden last year. Mr. Hur ultimately cleared Mr. Biden of criminal wrongdoing over his retention of classified material, despite faulting his memory and handling of sensitive documents. By contrast, prosecutors accused Mr. Trump of risking national security secrets by hoarding government records at his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\n\"Certain members of this committee and the Oversight Committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining -- for no legitimate purpose -- sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations,\" Mr. Garland is expected to say. He has argued that the recordings could be altered and used in pro-Trump political ads.\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" his prepared remarks continue. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated.\n\nLast month, President Biden asserted executive privilege to deny House Republicans access to the recordings, denouncing their effort as a political stunt with dire implications for federal law enforcement.\n\nIt came two months after a transcript was made public.\n\nThe move was intended to shield the department, and Mr. Garland, from prosecution if House Republicans voted to hold him in contempt. They have yet to schedule a floor vote.\n\nMr. Garland said at the time that the bid by Republicans was the latest in \"a series of unprecedented and, frankly, unfounded attacks\" on the department and the rule of law.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Garland is expected to tell Republicans that those efforts are feeding \"heinous\" threats against \"individual career agents\" and prosecutors.\n\n\"These attacks have not, and they will not, influence our decision making,\" he is expected to say.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Oversight_and_Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the committee's top Republican, criticized Garland in his opening statement for a broad array of what he depicted as politically motivated decisions by federal law enforcement -- including the conclusions by different special counsels that Trump criminally mishandled classified documents while Biden did not.\n\n\"Many Americans believe there's now a double standard in our justice system. They believe that because there is,\" Jordan said.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, who was investigated by the Justice Department but not charged in a sex trafficking inquiry, had a tense exchange early in the hearing when he demanded to know if the department would produce records related to the New York state case in which Trump was convicted last week.\n\nGarland disputed as false allegations by Gaetz that he had \"dispatched\" to the Manhattan District Attorney office a Justice Department attorney who later became part of the Trump prosecution team, insisting that he had nothing to do with it.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The committee subpoenaed Garland for those tapes in February as part of an investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents.\n\n\"The Department of Justice, under Attorney General Merrick Garland, is advancing a two-tiered system of justice and has been directly involved in the lawfare against its political opponents like President Trump,\" Jordan told the Washington Examiner in a statement. \"Committee members will press Attorney General Garland on these abuses and his role in playing defense counsel for the President by withholding key evidence from Congress.\"\n\nGarland's testimony also comes as lawmakers consider holding him in contempt for evading the subpoena, a move that would force an uncomfortable vote for many vulnerable Republicans running for reelection in Biden-won districts. It's unclear when such a measure could be brought to the floor, as a time frame is still being worked out among GOP leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are threatening to hit back against the Biden administration in other ways after Trump was convicted of 34 charges last week by a Manhattan jury, something they largely accuse Democrats of orchestrating in order to harm Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nShortly after Trump's verdict was announced, Jordan sent requests to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and prosecutor Matthew Colangelo to appear before Congress later in June for a public hearing to discuss the case. Jordan has been investigating the two attorneys over the last several months over allegations the pair had revived the criminal case against Trump to sink his reelection bid.\n\nJordan has also made funding requests for the 2025 fiscal year to include cuts for \"politicized prosecutions from state and local prosecutors engaged in lawfare,\" specifically naming Bragg, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in Georgia, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who each have opened cases against Trump.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee chairman also requested to cut funding for \"abusive federal law enforcement agencies,\" including special counsel Jack Smith, who is heading Trump's Jan. 6 election interference and classified documents criminal cases.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nOther GOP lawmakers have also called for the defunding of Smith's office, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who has previously introduced legislation to cut off funding to his investigation into Trump.\n\nJohnson has suggested he would be open to restricting federal funds, telling Fox News on Sunday that Smith is \"abusing his authority.\" It's not entirely clear how Johnson would move forward, but the speaker noted the House has \"mechanisms to try to get control of that. We'll be doing that within the confines of our jurisdiction.\"\n\nGreene has repeatedly called on Johnson to defund Smith's office, even using it as leverage earlier this year as she threatened to force a motion to vacate and remove him from the speakership position.\n\n\"The speaker of the House is one of the most powerful people in the country. We control the budget, we control the power of the purse,\" Greene said on Tuesday. \"If Speaker Johnson actually supports President Trump like he claims, he should stop special counsel Jack Smith and we should be using the power of the purse to hold New York accountable for the sham convictions against President Trump.\"\n\nEven if the House managed to pass government funding legislation that included cuts to the Justice Department and Smith's office, the proposals are unlikely to survive in the Democratic-led Senate, risking a government shutdown later this fall. When pressed on that risk, Greene contended that \"it doesn't matter.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I mean, it literally does not matter, and that's how people feel,\" she said. \"We aren't a serious country anymore. We are literally a banana republic. So what does it matter funding the government?

We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nIn May, Republicans initiated proceedings to hold Garland in contempt of Congress after the Justice Department refused to provide lawmakers with audio recordings of a deposition President Joe Biden gave to Special Counsel Robert Hur's investigation into classified documents found at Biden's office and residence. When Hur announced that the DOJ would not be leveling criminal charges against Biden, he described the president \"as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,\" and claimed Biden could not remember critical dates and events, including the death of his son Beau. The White House strongly condemned the characterization of the president's mental faculties, calling the report, released in February, \"highly prejudicial\" against Biden.\n\nAs the GOP moved to punish Garland for refusing to hand over the recordings - despite the fact that lawmakers already had access to full transcripts of the interview -- the Biden administration exerted executive privilege over the recordings.\n\n\"Certain members of this committee, and the Oversight Committee, are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining - for no legitimate purpose - sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations,\" Garland told the committee on Tuesday.\n\nInevitably, lawmakers' focus was repeatedly directed to last week's conviction of Trump in New York on charges of falsification of business records.\n\nGarland was adamant in his testimony that state prosecutor's offices -- including the New York office that brought the case against Trump -- operate independently of the Justice Department. \"We don't control the Manhattan district attorney and he does not report to us. The Manhattan district attorney makes its own decisions about cases that he wants to bring under his state law,\" Garland said.\n\nRep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) pushed back on the GOP's claims that the Justice Department has been weaponized to unfairly persecute conservatives. Cohen noted that the DOJ was currently prosecuting cases against Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, and Hunter Biden, the president's son.\n\nCohen also noted that the department had declined to bring charges against Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) after an investigation into allegations of sex trafficking. \"He is living testimony to the fact -- and direct evidence -- that you have not weaponized,\" the department.\n\nGarland warned that the conspiracy theories surrounding the Justice Department, including claims that the FBI had planned to assassinate Trump during their search of Mar-a-Lago, \"raises the threats of violence against prosecutors and career agents.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The White House has said Republican lawmakers only want the audio so they can chop it up and use it for political purposes.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued witnesses might be less likely to cooperate if they know their interviews might become public. Garland told lawmakers he would not \"jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Garland said. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the committee's top Republican, criticized Garland in his opening statement for a broad array of what he depicted as politically motivated decisions by federal law enforcement -- including the conclusions by different special counsels that Trump criminally mishandled classified documents while Biden did not.\n\n\"Many Americans believe there's now a double standard in our justice system.

The committee subpoenaed Garland for those tapes in February as part of an investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents.\n\n\"The Department of Justice, under Attorney General Merrick Garland, is advancing a two-tiered system of justice and has been directly involved in the lawfare against its political opponents like President Trump,\" Jordan told the Washington Examiner in a statement. \"Committee members will press Attorney General Garland on these abuses and his role in playing defense counsel for the President by withholding key evidence from Congress.\"\n\nGarland's testimony also comes as lawmakers consider holding him in contempt for evading the subpoena, a move that would force an uncomfortable vote for many vulnerable Republicans running for reelection in Biden-won districts. It's unclear when such a measure could be brought to the floor, as a time frame is still being worked out among GOP leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are threatening to hit back against the Biden administration in other ways after Trump was convicted of 34 charges last week by a Manhattan jury, something they largely accuse Democrats of orchestrating in order to harm Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nShortly after Trump's verdict was announced, Jordan sent requests to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and prosecutor Matthew Colangelo to appear before Congress later in June for a public hearing to discuss the case. Jordan has been investigating the two attorneys over the last several months over allegations the pair had revived the criminal case against Trump to sink his reelection bid.\n\nJordan has also made funding requests for the 2025 fiscal year to include cuts for \"politicized prosecutions from state and local prosecutors engaged in lawfare,\" specifically naming Bragg, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in Georgia, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who each have opened cases against Trump.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee chairman also requested to cut funding for \"abusive federal law enforcement agencies,\" including special counsel Jack Smith, who is heading Trump's Jan. 6 election interference and classified documents criminal cases.\n\nOther GOP lawmakers have also called for the defunding of Smith's office, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who has previously introduced legislation to cut off funding to his investigation into Trump.\n\nJohnson has suggested he would be open to restricting federal funds, telling Fox News on Sunday that Smith is \"abusing his authority.\" It's not entirely clear how Johnson would move forward, but the speaker noted the House has \"mechanisms to try to get control of that. We'll be doing that within the confines of our jurisdiction.\"\n\nGreene has repeatedly called on Johnson to defund Smith's office, even using it as leverage earlier this year as she threatened to force a motion to vacate and remove him from the speakership position.\n\n\"The speaker of the House is one of the most powerful people in the country. We control the budget, we control the power of the purse,\" Greene said on Tuesday. \"If Speaker Johnson actually supports President Trump like he claims, he should stop special counsel Jack Smith and we should be using the power of the purse to hold New York accountable for the sham convictions against President Trump.\"\n\nEven if the House managed to pass government funding legislation that included cuts to the Justice Department and Smith's office, the proposals are unlikely to survive in the Democratic-led Senate, risking a government shutdown later this fall. When pressed on that risk, Greene contended that \"it doesn't matter.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I mean, it literally does not matter, and that's how people feel,\" she said. \"We aren't a serious country anymore.

He has repeatedly vowed to follow the facts and the law along the way but has been unable to limit criticisms about how he and the department he runs have gone about the cases.\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Garland said. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending democracy.\"\n\nHe has overseen three special counsel investigations: one into President Joe Biden's handling of classified documents, a probe into the president's son and two cases against Trump for allegedly mishandling classified documents and playing a role in the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.\n\nThe appointment of special counsels to oversee the cases was meant to avoid politics from getting in the way of investigations, but instead has angered lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Hur's investigation of Biden prompted Democratic backlash for painting an unflattering image of Biden's mental fitness despite clearing him of facing charges. The saga has also put Garland in the crosshairs of GOP lawmakers, who are considering holding the attorney general in contempt of Congress for refusing to turn over an audio recording of Hur's interviews with the president that raised questions about his mental state.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued against releasing audio recordings over concerns that it could deter future witnesses and others from cooperating with future investigations.\n\n\"Certain members of this committee and the Oversight Committee are seeking contempt as a means of obtaining -- for no legitimate purpose -- sensitive law enforcement information that could harm the integrity of future investigations,\" Garland said. \"This effort is only the most recent in a long line of attacks on the Justice Department's work.\"\n\nThe White House has also said Republican lawmakers just want the audio to selectively edit it and use it for political purposes.\n\nDemocrats on the committee accused Republicans of using their majority to help further Trump's legal defense and ambitions to get back to the White House.\n\n\"This committee, once an agent of momentum to move our country forward, has become little more than a field office for the Trump campaign. The Republicans on this committee have spent 20 million taxpayer dollars working to get Trump reelected,\" said committee ranking member Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.\n\nBoth cases brought by Jack Smith against Trump have stalled out in courts and appear unlikely to go to trial before the November election as the former president's legal team has sought to delay them from the outset. Garland and the Justice Department have frequently been targeted by Republicans with accusations of weaponizing the legal system to hurt Trump's presidential campaign and going out of its way to target conservatives.\n\n\"Justice is no longer blind in America,\" committee chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said. \"Today it's driven by politics. Example No. 1 is President Trump.\"\n\nGOP investigators in the House have held a series of hearings and requested thousands of pages of documents in the cases against Trump, Biden and the president's son and conducted numerous interviews with people involved in them. Republicans have also floated revoking funding from Smith's investigations of Trump, though that is highly improbable with fiscal year spending bills unlikely to be finished before the November election and a Democratic Senate and White House.\n\nVOTE |Do you think the Justice Department has been politically weaponized against Republicans and Donald Trump?\n\nOpening arguments in Hunter Biden's gun case were getting underway as the hearing with Garland began. A jury was sat in the case on Monday, teeing off another politically sensitive court case for the justice system to navigate.\n\nWhile Hunter Biden's case is now going to trial, that did not come without its own winding saga and accusations of politics weighing on how it played out. A plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time collapsed in unexpected fashion when a judge questioned it, and it being offered sparked criticisms from congressional Republicans of a \"sweetheart deal\" for the president's son while Trump faced two federal cases.\n\nSeveral GOP lawmakers also accused the Justice Department was involved in the hush money case against Trump, which was brought by a local district attorney in state court. Trump and others have charged that New York prosecutors brought the case at the discretion of the Justice Department, though federal prosecutors declined to file charges on the issue.\n\nGarland batted those accusations away as a \"conspiracy theory\" that further diminishes the standing of the justice system and judicial process.\n\nHe also sought to rebut a claim made by the former president and some other Republicans that the FBI had approval to assassinate him during their search of Mar-a-Lago in the classified documents case, noting that it was standard language in serving warrants and was also included in a search of Biden's home.", "source": {"uri": "okcfox.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KOKH"}, "authors": [{"uri": "austin_denean@okcfox.com", "name": "Austin Denean", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nGarland's appearance before Congress comes after Trump was convicted last week by a jury in New York City on 34 counts of falsifying documents to cover up a payment to silence an adult film star ahead of the 2016 election. It's the first time a former president has been criminally indicted, let alone convicted.\n\nSeveral Republicans in Congress have pilloried the verdict, with some suggesting that the department in U.S. President Joe Biden's administration was somehow influencing the decision to prosecute in New York.\n\nWATCH l Trump warns of potential 'breaking point' for public if he's imprisoned:\n\nTrump still faces three other looming criminal cases -- two brought by federal special counsel Jack Smith over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his mishandling of classified documents, and a state case in Georgia also tied to his actions in the 2020 election.\n\nRepublicans have claimed all four cases are politically motivated and represent an effort by Trump's rival Biden to interfere in the 2024 election on Nov. 5, though every investigation that led to charges began before Trump announced he was running for the nation's highest office.\n\n\"We do not control the Manhattan district attorney, the Manhattan district attorney does not report to us,\" said Garland of Trump's recent conviction by a jury.\n\n\"That conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" he said at another point.\n\nWith respect to the documents case, Garland defended law enforcement after Trump falsely claimed the FBI was \"authorized to shoot me\" and was \"locked and loaded\" when a search warrant was executed at his Florida estate in August 2022.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declined to impose a gag order barring Trump from making inflammatory comments that could endanger FBI agents, some of whom will be witnesses at trial.\n\nWATCH l Wildly different conclusions in Congress to report on presidential probe:\n\nGarland said \"baseless and extremely dangerous falsehoods\" are being spread about the FBI's law enforcement operations, and that he was distressed by an atmosphere in which prosecutors, witnesses, civil servants and election workers are receiving threats for performing their duties.\n\nOn Monday, NBC News reported that Michael Cohen, the former Trump lawyer who testified against him, had been subjected to doxing of personal information.\n\nHis department was prepared to file charges for any action against public servants that crosses over into criminality, he said.\n\nNot long after the search at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, an Ohio man was killed in a gun battle after an attack on an FBI office. A year later, in August 2023, a Utah man who had made violent threats online against Biden and prosecutors in Trump cases was shot dead.\n\nDemocrats, including Tennessee Rep. Steve Cohen at Tuesday's hearing, have countered Republican claims of a weaponized or two-tier justice system by pointing out that Garland's department has filed criminal charges against Democratic legislators Bob Menendez and Henry Cuellar in corruption cases.\n\nAs well, Garland appointed a special counsel to examine various allegations involving Hunter Biden, the president's son. Hunter Biden is facing trial beginning this week on an illegal gun possession charge, and he faces a September trial date for alleged tax offences.\n\nDespite those prosecutions, Republican congressman Tom McClintock on Tuesday asserted that the president's son had received \"a sweetheart deal\" without elaborating.\n\nThe House's judiciary committee and the House's oversight committee have also sought to advance contempt proceedings against Garland, after he refused to provide audio recordings of Joe Biden's interview with a special counsel who investigated his retention of classified records. Garland said that Republican request serves \"no legitimate purpose.\"\n\nThat special counsel, Robert Hur, said in a report that a jury would possibly sympathize with Joe Biden as a \"well meaning, elderly man\" with a \"poor memory.\"\n\nElsewhere, Garland touted the department's efforts to disrupt international drug trafficking as well as prosecuting corporate malfeasance, pointing to the recent lawsuit directed at Live Nation, owner of Ticketmaster.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The White House has said Republican lawmakers only want the audio so they can chop it up and use it for political purposes.\n\nThe Justice Department has argued witnesses might be less likely to cooperate if they know their interviews might become public. Garland told lawmakers he would not \"jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"\n\n\"I will not be intimidated,\" Garland said. \"And the Justice Department will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, the committee's top Republican, criticized Garland in his opening statement for a broad array of what he depicted as politically motivated decisions by federal law enforcement -- including the conclusions by different special counsels that Trump criminally mishandled classified documents while Biden did not.\n\n\"Many Americans believe there's now a double standard in our justice system.

Republicans say that access to the tapes would provide valuable information beyond what a written transcript can provide, but the Department of Justice has raised questions over whether the House GOP is seeking the audio files solely for political purposes and maintains they have distinct privacy concerns to protect.\n\nIn April, CNN sued for access to the recordings of Biden's interview.\n\nGarland denounced Republican-led attacks on the Justice Department in remarks following the announcement that Biden would assert executive privilege.\n\nThe White House asserted executive privilege at the request of Garland, who wrote to the president on May 15.\n\nIn their contempt reports, Republicans stated the DOJ does not get to determine what information is useful to their investigation, and argued that the verbal nuances of an audio recording provide unique insight into a subject that are not reflected in a transcript.", "source": {"uri": "us.cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "annie_grayer@us.cnn.com", "name": "Annie Grayer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "devan_cole@us.cnn.com", "name": "Devan Cole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "hannah_rabinowitz@us.cnn.com", "name": "Hannah Rabinowitz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

The committee subpoenaed Garland for those tapes in February as part of an investigation into Biden's handling of classified documents.\n\n\"The Department of Justice, under Attorney General Merrick Garland, is advancing a two-tiered system of justice and has been directly involved in the lawfare against its political opponents like President Trump,\" Jordan told the Washington Examiner in a statement. \"Committee members will press Attorney General Garland on these abuses and his role in playing defense counsel for the President by withholding key evidence from Congress.\"\n\nGarland's testimony also comes as lawmakers consider holding him in contempt for evading the subpoena, a move that would force an uncomfortable vote for many vulnerable Republicans running for reelection in Biden-won districts. It's unclear when such a measure could be brought to the floor, as a time frame is still being worked out among GOP leaders.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are threatening to hit back against the Biden administration in other ways after Trump was convicted of 34 charges last week by a Manhattan jury, something they largely accuse Democrats of orchestrating in order to harm Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nShortly after Trump's verdict was announced, Jordan sent requests to Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and prosecutor Matthew Colangelo to appear before Congress later in June for a public hearing to discuss the case. Jordan has been investigating the two attorneys over the last several months over allegations the pair had revived the criminal case against Trump to sink his reelection bid.\n\nJordan has also made funding requests for the 2025 fiscal year to include cuts for \"politicized prosecutions from state and local prosecutors engaged in lawfare,\" specifically naming Bragg, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in Georgia, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who each have opened cases against Trump.\n\nThe Judiciary Committee chairman also requested to cut funding for \"abusive federal law enforcement agencies,\" including special counsel Jack Smith, who is heading Trump's Jan. 6 election interference and classified documents criminal cases.\n\nOther GOP lawmakers have also called for the defunding of Smith's office, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who has previously introduced legislation to cut off funding to his investigation into Trump.\n\nJohnson has suggested he would be open to restricting federal funds, telling Fox News on Sunday that Smith is \"abusing his authority.\" It's not entirely clear how Johnson would move forward, but the speaker noted the House has \"mechanisms to try to get control of that. We'll be doing that within the confines of our jurisdiction.\"\n\nGreene has repeatedly called on Johnson to defund Smith's office, even using it as leverage earlier this year as she threatened to force a motion to vacate and remove him from the speakership position.\n\n\"The speaker of the House is one of the most powerful people in the country. We control the budget, we control the power of the purse,\" Greene said on Tuesday. \"If Speaker Johnson actually supports President Trump like he claims, he should stop special counsel Jack Smith and we should be using the power of the purse to hold New York accountable for the sham convictions against President Trump.\"\n\nEven if the House managed to pass government funding legislation that included cuts to the Justice Department and Smith's office, the proposals are unlikely to survive in the Democratic-led Senate, risking a government shutdown later this fall. When pressed on that risk, Greene contended that \"it doesn't matter.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I mean, it literally does not matter, and that's how people feel,\" she said. \"We aren't a serious country anymore. We are literally a banana republic. So what does it matter funding the government?

He added that Mr. Colangelo's employment history \"demonstrates his obsession with investigating a person rather than prosecuting a crime.\"\n\nThe attorney general on Tuesday criticized Republican lawmakers on the House panel, saying that he \"will not be intimidated,\" and \"we will continue to do our jobs free from political influence. And we will not back down from defending our democracy.\"\n\n\"It comes alongside threats to defund particular department investigations, most recently the special counsel's prosecution of the former president,\" Mr. Garland added.\n\nPresident Trump still faces three other state or federal criminal cases, two brought by special counsel Jack Smith over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his alleged mishandling of classified documents, and a state case in Georgia, also tied to his actions in the 2020 White House race.\n\nRepublicans have alleged all four cases are politically motivated and represent an effort by President Trump's rival, President Joe Biden, to interfere in the Nov. 5, 2024, election.\n\n\"Many Americans believe there is now a double standard in our justice system,\" Mr. Jordan, the House Judiciary chairman, said on Tuesday. \"They believe that because there is.\"\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) on Tuesday asked Mr. Garland several times about whether he had \"dispatched\" Mr. Colangelo to work with the Manhattan District Attorney's office.\n\n\"It's false,\" Mr. Garland replied. \"I did not dispatch Mr. Colangelo anywhere.\"\n\nThe attorney general also pushed back on the Judiciary Committee's threats to hold him in contempt of Congress. \"I view contempt as a serious matter,\" he said. \"But I will not jeopardize the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"\n\nA judge has set a sentencing date for President Trump of July 11. He previously pleaded not guilty to the charges, saying they're part of a longstanding effort to imperil his reelection chances.\n\nLast week, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declined to impose a gag order barring President Trump from making comments after he said that FBI agents were \"locked and loaded\" during their raid targeting his Mar-a-Lago residence in a separate case. Mr. Smith, the special counsel, has since renewed a gag order request.\n\nMr. Garland and the FBI have both said that the FBI agents used the bureau's standard operating procedure when conducting the search.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type":

Both cases resulted in several indictments. Jordan wanted to know why Smith was chosen:\n\nJordan: Why did you pick... This is probably the most high-profile special counsel investigation, maybe in American history. You're going to be investigating a former president, a candidate for president and leading in all the polls. And you pick Jack Smith. Most important selection maybe ever made from the attorney general. When you comes to a special counsel, I want to know why you could have picked.\n\nGarland: Well, I'm-\n\nJordan: Former AGs, deputy AGs, U.S. attorneys, you got all kinds of lawyers in this town, but you pick Jack Smith.\n\nGarland: All the people you just mentioned were political would be political appointees. I appointed somebody who is not a political appointee, somebody who is an independent, nonpartisan with a record of career experience as a prosecutor. That seemed to me the perfect resume for making that kind of-\n\nJordan: He was a guy, the guy worked, you had to bring him back from Europe. You worked at the ICC, worked at the World Court. He was the best pick for the most high profile investigation ever?\n\nGarland: He was independent, he was nonpartisan. He had never held a political office. He was never appointed in a political office.

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and Attorney General Merrick Garland butted heads right out of the gate at a fiery House hearing on Tuesday.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Garland highlighted a number of actions the Justice Department has taken recently, and he also pushed back against Donald Trump supporters who argue President Joe Biden and Garland have anything to do with Trump's legal troubles, including his hush money trial in Manhattan where he was recently convicted on more than 30 felony counts.\n\nGaetz was the first lawmaker to get time to question Garland, and he told the attorney general he could clear up the \"dangerous conspiracy theory\" of collusion if he agreed to hand over any and all communications between the Justice Department and the offices of prosecutors targeting Trump, like Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\n\nGarland pushed back, saying those are independent offices and the two began going back and forth with Gaetz finally growing frustrated with Garland explaining the separation of state and federal offices.\n\n\"The question is whether or not you will provide all your documents and correspondence. I don't need a history lesson,\" Gaetz said.\n\nGarland echoed his previous point.\n\nGaetz found Garland equally unwilling to answer thinly-veiled questions about Trump's hush money trial.\n\n\"When you were a judge, did you ever make political donations to partisan candidates?\" Gaetz asked, referring to Garland's past as a judge and the revelation that Judge Juan Merchan, who presides over Trump's trial in Manhattan, previously donated to Biden.\n\n\"No,\" Garland answered, explaining there's a federal rule against such donations.\n\nThe attorney general grew frustrated with Gaetz's questions about Trump's trial after as Gaetz began asking about having family \"profit\" off of a specific case. Gaetz appeared to be referring to reports that Merchan's daughter works for a consulting firm that works with Democrats.\n\n\"I'm well aware you're not asking me a hypothetical. You're asking me to comment on a jury verdict in another jurisdiction which has to be respected. I won't comment on it. That case is still ongoing -- \" Garland said before Gaetz jumped back in.\n\n\"Mr. Attorney General, I hadn't asked you about the verdict yet. We were getting there. I was talking about the judge,\" he said.\n\nGarland echoed his past point that he can't directly comment about the case.\n\n\"Well, it seems you're connecting the dots, Mr. Attorney General! I'm just asking in general principle, but you are aware that Judge Merchan's daughter was profiting off this prosecution,\" Gaetz said. \"You are aware that that creates the appearance of impropriety. You know there's a reason there's a federal rule against judges giving donations because it is the very attack on the judicial process that we're concerned about.\"\n\n\"I'm sorry. I don't agree with anything you just said,\" Garland shot back, \"but I'm not going to comment on an active [case].\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Merchan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juan Merchan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Free_Donations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Free Donations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/gaetz.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623002", "eventUri": "eng-9623002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who had been under investigation for a case that involved sex trafficking, and Cohen called him a \"living testament to the fact, and direct evidence, that you have not weaponized the Justice Department.\"\n\n\"While many were expecting a prosecution, you chose not to prosecute this very active Republican,\" Cohen said.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Cohen (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/washington-dc-july-13-house-judiciary-committee-member-rep-steve-cohen-d-tn-c-tells-a-fellow-committee-member-to-shut.jpg?id=52377066&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623002", "eventUri": "eng-9623002", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

Robert Hur's interview with Mr. Biden because the president asserted executive privilege over the audio. Prosecutors had previously released the transcript of the deposition, and it remains uncertain whether the contempt vote will be brought to the full chamber for a vote.\n\nThe attorney general struck a more defiant tone than in past hearings, telling the committee: \"I will not be intimidated. And the Department of Justice will not be intimidated. We will continue to do our job without political influence. And we will not to support away from the defense of our democracy\".\n\nThe Justice Department has argued that handing over the actual recording of Mr. Biden's interview risked chilling future investigations.\n\n\"I view contempt as a serious matter,\" Garland said Tuesday. \"But I will not compromise the ability of our prosecutors and agents to do their jobs effectively in future investigations.\"\n\nof special adviserwho was appointed by Garland to lead the probe, chose not to charge Mr. Biden as part of the probe, but criticized his handling of classified records and questioned whether prosecutors would have been able to convince a jury to convict Mr. given his age and memory.\n\nIn response to last month's executive privilege claim, Jim Jordan, Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee claimed, \"President Biden is claiming executive privilege for the same reason we need the audio recordings -- they provide a unique perspective. \"\n\nThe White House and Mr. Biden rejected Hur's characterizations of the president's retraction in the interview and argued that the transcript offered a more complete view of the deposition.\n\nHur is not the only special counsel Garland has appointed in his three years leading the Justice Department, and he likely won't be the only independent investigator Garland will have to answer for as he testifies Tuesday.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has brought two cases against former President Donald Trump -- one related to the 2020 election and the other related to his handling of classified information. Meanwhile, special counsel David Weiss, a Trump-appointed US attorney from Delaware, is currently in the middle of a trial against the president's son, Hunter Biden. He claimed Hunter Biden had illegally purchased a firearm while on drugs.\n\nBoth Trump and Hunter Biden have pleaded not guilty, denied wrongdoing and accused the Justice Department of letting politics influence the investigation, accusations from both the political right and left that Garland has denied.\n\n\"[The contempt threat] is just the latest in a long line of attacks on the work of the Justice Department,\" the attorney general told lawmakers. \"It comes alongside threats to defund investigations of individual departments, most recently the prosecution of former to the president by the special counsel.\"\n\nA Justice Department spokesman said in a statement before the testimony that Garland will highlight the department's work throughout his tenure and \"forcefully push back false narratives about the Department's employees and their work.\"\n\nGarland's three years at the helm of the Justice Department have produced results on what he said are the department's priorities, including war crimes charges brought in connection with Russia's offensive in Ukraine, antitrust cases brought against corporate giants like Apple and Ticketmaster and efforts to curb violent crime.\n\nHowever, Tuesday's testimony from the attorney general and questions from the panel are likely to highlight partisan political tensions.\n\n\"We are seeing heinous threats of violence directed at career public servants of the Department of Justice,\" Garland said in his opening statement.\n\nIn particular, he also addressed Trump's conviction in New York state court last week on 34 felony charges, calling insinuations by Trump and his supporters that the Justice Department was involved \"false.\"\n\n\"This conspiracy theory is an attack on the judicial process itself,\" Garland said. \"These repeated attacks on the Department of Justice are unprecedented and baseless....These attacks have not -- and will not -- influence our decision-making.\"\n\nOne of the Justice Department's top officials, FBI Director Christopher Wray, is scheduled to appear before a Senate Appropriations Committee subcommittee hours after the attorney general faces the House committee.\n\nDuring his most recent appearance on Capitol Hill, Wray warned: \"I would be hard-pressed to think of a time where so many threats to our public and national security were so high at once.\" He is likely to reiterate those concerns on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe FBI director told Congress in April that he was continuing conflict in Gaza has fueled an increase in threats against the US, with the most imminent danger posed by those seeking to launch attacks on US soil.\n\nDuring that testimony earlier this year, Wray, like Garland, also warned of \"increasing threats\" against agents and facilities. \"Having a badge is dangerous enough. It shouldn't also make you a target,\" he said.\n\nSince then, Smith, the special counsel investigating Trump, asked a federal judge to limit the former president's public comments after Trump made false claims that FBI agents were \"authorized to shoot\" him while executing a court-authorized search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago mansion in August 2022. Smith claimed last month that Trump had \"grossly distorted these standard practices by mischaracterizing them as a plan to kill him, his family and US Secret Service agents.\" His social media posts and campaign emails on the subject, prosecutors wrote, \"present a significant, imminent and foreseeable danger to law enforcement agents.\"\n\nTrump opposed the move, and the federal judge overseeing that case has yet to rule on the matter and asked for further briefing in the coming weeks.\n\nIn a statement, the FBI said, \"The FBI followed standard protocol in this search, as we do for all search warrants, which includes a standard policy statement limiting the use of deadly force. No one ordered additional steps to be taken and no there was no departure from the norm in this matter.\"", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Executive privilege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deposition (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Classified information"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Hur", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

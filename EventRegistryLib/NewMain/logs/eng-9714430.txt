What Louisiana recently did with requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in all schools is a clear violation of the Establishment Clause. No religion should be able to claim government approval in America.\n\nAn important story in the New Testament tells us that the words of the Ten Commandments are not what is most important about them. It is their inherent meaning that is important. A rich young man asks Jesus what he must do to be saved. When told to \"keep the commandments,\" he confidently answered \"I have kept them from my youth.\" Then he is told, \"One thing you lack, go sell everything you own and give the money to the poor.\" He went away very sad because he had a lot of money and did not want to part with it. Those who want to post the text of the Ten Commandments are missing the point. In fact, the summary of the Ten Commandments ends with \"love your neighbor as yourself.\" The essential question then becomes, \"Who is my neighbor?\"\n\nThe answer is given in the famous story of the despised outcast person who aids an injured person that several religious leaders had passed by. The injured \"neighbor\" is cared for and arrangements made for continuing care at an inn until he is well.\n\nAmerica as a nation can actually fulfill the inner meaning of the Ten Commandments by having policies and programs that help people who have been injured in life or are not able to help themselves because of age or sickness. Under President Roosevelt in the 1930s our society began to make arrangements to take care of those who needed it with Social Security. Later under President Johnson we added Medicare and Medicaid. Then, under President Obama, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was added and has provided tens of millions with affordable health insurance. In these and other examples, our country has made attempts to care for those who are simply not strong enough to care for themselves in our expensive world, as the Good Samaritan did in the Bible.\n\nWe need to elect leaders who have a vision for lifting people through extending many opportunities for education, work and remaining healthy. It turns out that it is not the actual words of the Ten Commandments that are most important, but what amounts to the \"The Golden Rule\" of doing unto others as we would have them do unto us, almost universally recognized by all religions and those with no religion as the way we should live. It is written in the consciences of people as what is right to do. It is what our nation needs to constantly work at doing for our people and with other nations for all people. Our nation has shown over the years that building wealth alone and for ourselves ends up hurting everyone, as in the Great Depression caused by the lack of regulation of the 1920s. That is a lesson we can never forget.\n\nIn fact, we are now in danger of damaging our world beyond repair. As human beings we will always need sensible regulations to preserve creation. Living for maximum profit alone is breaking the unwritten commandments of the human heart. When we do that (not caring for our neighbors) we break ourselves as individuals and as a nation. It took us decades up to the present to learn that a society that plans for the care of all, including our fellow humans and the world around us, is what is best for all of us. All people know that caring for others as we care for ourselves is the most fulfilling life and creates the most satisfying and fulfilling society.\n\nMore: Opinion: America's secular government must not favor any specific religion\n\nMore: Opinion: Change in attitude and acceptance of LGBTQ people became socio-religious movement\n\nRev.

Jeff Landry in June, mandates that by January 1, 2025, a poster-sized display of a state-approved version of the Ten Commandments with \"large, easily readable font\" be put in every classroom from kindergarten through the university-level at state-funded schools. Louisiana is currently the only state with the requirement.\n\nIn the complaint, the plaintiffs argue that mandating the Ten Commandments be posted in every classroom renders them \"unavoidable\" and \"unconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state's favored religious scripture.\"\n\n\"It also sends the harmful and religiously divisive message that students who do not subscribe to the Ten Commandments -- or, more precisely, to the specific version of the Ten Commandments that H.B. 71 requires schools to display -- do not belong in their own school community and should refrain from expressing any faith practices of beliefs that are not aligned with the state's religious preferences,\" the complaint continues.\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, on behalf of nine \"multi-faith families\" with students enrolled in Louisiana public schools.\n\nIt names state Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, several other Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education officials, and some local school boards.\n\nWhen asked about the lawsuit, Brumley told CNN in a statement last month that he looked forward to implementing the law.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments law passed with overwhelming support in Louisiana's state legislature and was enthusiastically signed by our Governor,\" he said. \"I look forward to implementing the law and defending Louisiana's sovereign interest to select classroom content fundamental to America's foundation.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They are now seeking an injunction from a federal court to prevent the law from being enforced when students return to school in August.\n\nAs of June, Louisiana made it compulsory for every public school classroom to exhibit the Ten Commandments. The law specifies that by January 1, 2025, every classroom in the state must feature the Ten Commandments on a poster or framed document measuring at least eleven by fourteen inches, with a font size that is large and easy to read.\n\nWhen Louisiana's Republican governor, Jeff Landry, signed the law, he said it was a way of respecting Moses as \"the original law giver.\" When Landry was questioned about the legality of the requirement, he bragged, \"I can't wait to be sued.\" Landry's wish was fulfilled just days later when a multifaith group of nine families filed a federal lawsuit claiming that law violates the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana.\n\nThe plaintiff families, represented by the ACLU and multiple advocacy organizations, filed a motion for preliminary injunction Monday, asking the court to issue an emergency order blocking the law so that children returning to school in August are not subjected to \"unavoidable, permanently displayed religious directives.\"\n\nIn their filing, the plaintiffs noted that Landry posted about the law on his official social media pages, asking, \"Since when did the Ten Commandments become a bad way to live your life?!\" and sent out a fundraising email asking his supporters to help him defend the lawsuit and \"ADVANCE [] the Judeo-Christian values that this nation was built upon.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs say that the law pushes a denomination of Christianity that applies to only one segment of Louisiana residents -- one which \"is principally associated with Protestant beliefs and denominations.\" The scripture required by the state \"differ[s] in meaningful ways from those used by other denominations and faiths that recognize the Ten Commandments as part of their theology, including Catholicism and Judaism.\"\n\n\"The Act requires this Protestant version of the Ten Commandments to be displayed,\" the filing adds, after noting that for many religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and \"other non-western faiths,\" the Ten Commandments \"have no place at all.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs also argue that they are likely to win their lawsuit on its merits, because the Supreme Court has already clearly ruled that mandated Ten Commandments postings are unconstitutional. They also argued that maintaining the status quo while the legal challenges proceed is unlikely to cause harm.\n\nOver 40 years ago, the Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky statute that required posters of the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms. No ruling has ever overturned that precedent, and several later cases have reinforced its holding.\n\nStill, the challenge to the Louisiana law is proceeding at a time when the conservative-majority Supreme Court has been extraordinarily supportive of an expanded view of \"religious liberty.\" Moreover, the lawsuit is proceeding in federal district court in Louisiana and is presided over by U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles, a Barack Obama appointee. Should deGravelles side with the plaintiffs, Louisiana would have the option of appealing to the ultraconservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Middle_District_of_Louisiana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judeo-Christian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judeo-Christian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Exercise_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free Exercise Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Civil Liberties Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_denomination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian denomination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protestantism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hinduism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judaism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Theology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://am23.mediaite.com/lc/cnt/uploads/2024/06/Louisiana-Ten-Commandments.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714430", "eventUri": "eng-9714430", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Jeff Landry in June, mandates that by January 1, 2025, a poster-sized display of a state-approved version of the Ten Commandments with \"large, easily readable font\" be put in every classroom from kindergarten through the university-level at state-funded schools.\n\nLast month, Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters issued a memo requiring that schools in the state incorporate the Bible and the Ten Commandments into their curriculum, calling the Bible an \"indispensable historical and cultural touchstone.\"\n\nThe memo came after the state's Supreme Court blocked an effort to establish the first publicly funded religious charger school in the country, CNN previously reported.\n\nPlaintiffs in the Louisiana lawsuit argued mandating that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every classroom renders them \"unavoidable\" and \"unconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state's favored religious scripture.\"\n\n\"It also sends the harmful and religiously divisive message that students who do not subscribe to the Ten Commandments -- or, more precisely, to the specific version of the Ten Commandments that H.B. 71 requires schools to display -- do not belong in their own school community and should refrain from expressing any faith practices of beliefs that are not aligned with the state's religious preferences,\" the complaint continues.\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, on behalf of nine \"multi-faith families\" with students enrolled in Louisiana public schools.\n\nIt names state Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, several other Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education officials, and some local school boards.\n\nWhen asked about the lawsuit, Brumley told CNN in a statement last month that he looked forward to implementing the law.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments law passed with overwhelming support in Louisiana's state legislature and was enthusiastically signed by our Governor,\" he said. \"I look forward to implementing the law and defending Louisiana's sovereign interest to select classroom content fundamental to America's foundation.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

This essay is the prepared version of remarks he delivered at a Shabbat service on June 28.\n\nWell, let's see - what's in the news? What's in the news?\n\nHmm, let's see. Oh, there was an anti-Jewish pogrom outside of a synagogue in LA, with police in riot gear standing idly by for an hour while Jews were being blocked from shul, pepper-sprayed, and attacked in various ways.\n\nHmm... oh, all the major news outlets continued to ignore comprehensive analysis reports debunking previous, unfounded reports about imminent famine in Gaza, and they continue to ignore the UN's revised estimate of civilian casualties in Gaza in favor of the demonstrably false numbers supplied by Hamas.\n\nLocally... the Iowa Supreme Court ruled to allow the restriction of abortion within the state to impossible and unconscionable parameters, while supporters of the restriction continue to ignore possible unintended consequences such as a potential increase in abortion numbers as people are forced to make hasty decisions \"just in case.\"\n\nAnd on the Federal level, the media continues to refuse to inform the public about Supreme Court decisions, instead insisting on telling us what to think about Supreme Court decisions, based on what team we're on.\n\nAnd, lastly, in the wake of President Biden's dumpster-fire of a performance in last night's debate, Democrats are freaking out and making lists of possible alternative candidates, none of which include the otherwise excellent choice of Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, because we now live in a time when it is an uncontested given that a Jew could not possibly run for president right now.\n\nWith all that in mind, I'd like to offer some suggestions about how we might rearrange the deck chairs on this here Titanic. [That is to say, given all that's going on, the following seems like proverbial small potatoes:]\n\nFrom Louisiana House Bill No. 71. Section 1a:\n\nEach public school governing authority and the governing authority of each nonpublic school that receives state funds shall display the Ten Commandments in each building it uses and classroom in each school under its jurisdiction. The nature of the display shall be determined by each governing authority with a minimum requirement that the Ten Commandments shall be displayed on a poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches. The text of the Ten Commandments shall be the central focus of the poster or framed document and shall be printed in a large, easily readable font.\n\nAs it turns out, idiocy is neither a crime nor a specific religious transgression. However, for the authors and sponsors of this bill:\n\nRepresentatives Horton, Amedee, Bacala, Bamburg, Bayham, Billings, Boyer, Butler, Carlson, Carrier, Carver, Crews, Dewitt, Dickerson, Echols, Edmonston, Egan, Fiment, Galle, Kerner, Mack, Melerine, Owen, Riser, Schamerhorn, Taylor, Thompson, Ventrella, Wileder, and Wiley, and Senators Bass, and Hodges...\n\n...I, Rabbi Neal Schuster, hereby accuse you... of violating the Ten Commandments.\n\n...I mean, I also accuse you of being idiots, but that's not a formal charge.\n\nIs this uncharitable assertion because I have something against the Ten Commandments? I mean, just two weeks ago we celebrated the festival of Shavuot, commemorating the giving of the Ten Commandments. We stood and read them aloud from the Torah during morning services, so what could I possibly have against them?\n\nI have nothing against the Big Ten, as I like to call them. I'm actually a huge fan. I would love it if more people actually knew them and lived by them. They are not the issue.\n\nAnd the issue also isn't the completely overlooked irony that the same political forces that pushed this legislation, as columnist Peter Greene put it, have \"worked hard to end indoctrination in classrooms, [now] seem intent on installing some indoctrination of their own.\"\n\nAnd the issue isn't even the micromanaging and controlling aspect of specifying the size and style of the displays - although that does lend a bit of a sublime weirdness to the bill.\n\nWhere the issue does begin is with specifying the exact text of the so-called Ten Commandments that is to be displayed.\n\nWhy \"so-called\" Ten Commandments? Well, first of all, in Jewish tradition, they're not actually called the Ten Commandments. They're called aseret ha-dibrot, the Ten Utterences is really what it means. Still, I'm OK with calling it the Ten Commandments. But in this case, I say \"so-called\" because the text they provide is completely mangled and mistranslated.\n\nNot only does it ignore the fact that the Ten Commandments appear twice in the Torah, first in Exodus and again in Deuteronomy, with slight variations in the wording, but their version is chopped up and edited down. It's not even the whole thing.\n\nAnd the translation is totally off. There is no commandment \"Thou shalt not kill.\" It's \"Thou shalt not murder.\" The Hebrew is very clear, and killing and murder are not the same thing.\n\nWhere the issue really gets rolling, as columnist Eli Federman points out, is with the fact that in order to justify the requirement that it be posted in every classroom, they have declared that it is not a sacred, religious document, but, rather, a document of secular, historical importance -- they're no different from the Magna Carta, the Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence.\n\nIn the name of... whatever it is they're trying to do, they have turned the Ten Commandments from a sacred and religious covenant, into a secular object. But even worse, they have turned it into a secular object that they then proceed, effectively, to bow down to and worship.\n\nThat is what we call idolatry, and idolatry is definitely against the Ten Commandments.\n\nBut the worst violation is even more serious. If they had a better translation, they might know that the third commandment is not \"Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain,\" it is \"Thou shalt not carry the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\" And if they hadn't chopped up that commandment, they would know that it continues, and that it is the only one of the ten that says God will not forgive (or \"hold blameless\" or, literally, \"cleanse\") those who carry God's name in vain.\n\nIt is not a prohibition against saying God's name in vain, it is, ultimately, about not giving God a bad name, about not belittling or damaging the name and reputation of God. And that, they have accomplished in spades.\n\nDid they not know that it would be challenged and that the Supreme Court has already struck down a law like this in 1980?\n\nWas this bill a willful, intentional sewing of discord and conflict in our nation? Did none of them hesitate about turning something sacred and beautiful into an idolatrous object of political posturing. They weren't concerned about turning the Ten Commandments into an object of scorn and a byword for ugliness and strife and partisanship?\n\nLike we needed something else to be upset and fight about.\n\nSo, to the Louisiana legislature: Keep your hands off my commandments! Stop breaking them in order to save them. You don't like it when someone forces their ideology on you, so, please, stop forcing your ideology on everyone else.\n\nAnd just for one last good measure, to you Louisiana legislators, here are few other commandments you might want to keep in mind (from Leviticus 19):\n\nYou shall not hate your brother in your heart. You shall surely reproach your kinsfolk and do not bear sin because of them.\n\nYou shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against your people.\" - Ve-ahavta l'rei-echa k'mocha - \"You shall love your neighbor as yourself:\" and as the verse concludes, Ani Adonai - I am God.\n\nGod is God. Not you. Not me. Only God is God. So please stop giving \"Him\" a bad name. And, if you like, I'd be happy to print that up, in a large, readable font, on a nice 11\" x 14\" poster. Just, please don't make them post it at school.", "source": {"uri": "bleedingheartland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Heartland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The plaintiffs filed a motion Monday for a preliminary injunction, which would stop schools from posting displays while the court case plays out.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge John deGravelles of Louisiana's Middle District in Baton Rouge, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, is presiding over the case. If he grants the injunction, it would prevent any school from placing Ten Commandments displays once the school year begins.\n\n\"As argued in the brief, these displays will violate long-standing Supreme Court precedent,\" Americans United for Separation of Church and State, one of the groups representing plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in a statement. \"More than 40 years ago, in Stone v. Graham, the Supreme Court overturned a similar (Kentucky) state law, holding that the separation of church and state bars public schools from posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms.\"\n\nPlaintiffs' attorneys also note in the brief that the new law calls for a Protestant version of the Ten Commandments, which differs from those recognized by the Catholic and Jewish faiths.\n\nDefendants in the case include Louisiana Education Superintendent Cade Brumley, members of the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education and the school boards of East Baton Rouge, Livingston, Orleans, St. Tammany and Vernon parishes.\n\nGov.

The law requires that by Jan. 1, 2025, every public school classroom in the state must display the Ten Commandments \"on a poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches,\" in \"a large, easily readable font.\"\n\nWhen Louisiana's Republican governor, Jeff Landry, signed the law, he said it was a way of respecting Moses as \"the original law giver.\" When Landry was questioned about the legality of the requirement, he bragged, \"I can't wait to be sued.\" Landry's wish was fulfilled just days later when a multifaith group of nine families filed a federal lawsuit claiming that law violates the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana.\n\nThe plaintiff families, represented by the ACLU and multiple advocacy organizations, filed a motion for preliminary injunction Monday, asking the court to issue an emergency order blocking the law so that children returning to school in August are not subjected to \"unavoidable, permanently displayed religious directives.\"\n\nIn their filing, the plaintiffs noted that Landry posted about the law on his official social media pages, asking, \"Since when did the Ten Commandments become a bad way to live your life?!\" and sent out a fundraising email asking his supporters to help him defend the lawsuit and \"ADVANCE [] the Judeo-Christian values that this nation was built upon.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs say that the law pushes a denomination of Christianity that applies to only one segment of Louisiana residents -- one which \"is principally associated with Protestant beliefs and denominations.\" The scripture required by the state \"differ[s] in meaningful ways from those used by other denominations and faiths that recognize the Ten Commandments as part of their theology, including Catholicism and Judaism.\"\n\n\"The Act requires this Protestant version of the Ten Commandments to be displayed,\" the filing adds, after noting that for many religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and \"other non-western faiths,\" the Ten Commandments \"have no place at all.\"\n\nThe plaintiffs also argue that they are likely to win their lawsuit on its merits, because the Supreme Court has already clearly ruled that mandated Ten Commandments postings are unconstitutional. They also argued that maintaining the status quo while the legal challenges proceed is unlikely to cause harm.\n\nOver 40 years ago, the Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky statute that required posters of the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms. No ruling has ever overturned that precedent, and several later cases have reinforced its holding.\n\nStill, the challenge to the Louisiana law is proceeding at a time when the conservative-majority Supreme Court has been extraordinarily supportive of an expanded view of \"religious liberty.\" Moreover, the lawsuit is proceeding in federal district court in Louisiana and is presided over by U.S. District Judge John W. deGravelles, a Barack Obama appointee.

Truth is, it was never there to begin with. | Jonathan Zimmerman", "body": "Supporters of a Louisiana law that requires schools to display the Ten Commandments argue they were part of public education for centuries. But saying so would actually break the ninth one.\n\nOnce upon a time, public schools respected religion. They taught the Bible and posted the Ten Commandments. Then big bad liberals came along and took God out of the schools. And the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThat's what right-wingers want you to think, but they're wrong. In earlier eras, religious instruction wasn't nearly as common as they say. And when it did happen, it was promoted by political liberals as well as conservatives.\n\nYou're unlikely to hear that from Republicans in Louisiana -- who recently pushed through a law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in all classrooms -- or in Oklahoma, where the GOP superintendent of education ordered schools to teach the Bible in grades five through 12. They've got their story, and they're sticking to it.\n\nAccording to the Louisiana measure, the Ten Commandments \"were a prominent part of American public education for more than three centuries.\" No, they weren't.\n\nTrue, as the law notes, the Ten Commandments were included in the New England Primer and McGuffey's Reader in the colonial period and in the 1800s. But James Madison never claimed that \"the whole future of our new nation\" rests upon \"the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the principles of the Ten Commandments,\" as the measure also says.\n\nAccording to the editors of Madison's papers, there's no record of him making that statement. It's a hoax, which Louisiana has now enshrined into law.\n\nAnd in 1927, a poll by the Methodist Episcopal Church showed that most Americans couldn't name more than five of the commandments; the only one people identified consistently was the prohibition on adultery. What they knew came less from schools -- which had long abandoned McGuffey's Reader -- than from pop-culture adaptations like Cecil B. DeMille's 1923 blockbuster film, The Ten Commandments.\n\nDeMille released a glitzy new version of the movie in the 1950s, which also witnessed the first broadscale efforts to require the posting of the Ten Commandments in American classrooms. If the commandments had been such a longtime feature of schools, as the Louisiana law claims, we wouldn't have needed mandates to display them 70 years ago.\n\nDitto for Bible reading, which was hardly the ubiquitous practice conservatives imagine. Responding to an 1896 questionnaire, Nevada's school superintendent wrote that \"there is not one school in the State where the Bible is read.\" Of 26 school districts replying to the survey in California, 19 reported no Bible reading.\n\nIn the 1950s, advocates said that religious teaching would help distinguish America from the Soviet Union and 'Godless Communism.'\n\nSchool districts stepped up Bible instruction in the 1950s, just as they did with the posting of the Ten Commandments. In the midst of the Cold War, advocates said that religious teaching would help distinguish America from the Soviet Union and \"Godless Communism.\" During these same years, a similar rationale inspired Congress to add \"In God We Trust\" to our currency and \"Under God\" to the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nBut some citizens supported religious instruction as a way of fighting injustice at home, not just threats from abroad. That's why African Americans lined up to watch DeMille's The Ten Commandments, which depicted Moses liberating Jews from slavery in Egypt. The film is the \"Voice of the Minorities trying to be heard,\" one Black observer wrote. \"Take your family so that the story of the struggle will never grow dim.\"\n\nIn segregated Black schools, chapel services reminded students about the Bible's message of freedom for all. Likewise, white civil rights supporters said that lessons from Scripture would help liberate young people from \"the mental stockades of racial injustice,\" as a North Carolina Bible teacher wrote.\n\nThis coalition fell apart in the 1960s, when the U.S. Supreme Court barred school-sponsored prayer and Bible reading. Fearful of eroding the authority of the court on matters like voting rights and housing discrimination, liberals retreated from religion in schools.\n\nThat ceded the issue to conservatives, who have been braying for the Ten Commandments and Bible reading ever since. To get around obvious constitutional objections, Republican advocates for the Louisiana and Oklahoma measures have gamely argued that their efforts have a secular purpose -- to teach the role of these texts in American history -- rather than a religious one.\n\nIronically, the measures distort that same history. And their true purpose was more accurately captured by the GOP's putative presidential nominee, Donald Trump. \"I LOVE THE TEN COMMANDMENTS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS,\" Trump tweeted, in support of the Louisiana law. \"THIS MAY BE, IN FACT, THE FIRST MAJOR STEP IN THE REVIVAL OF RELIGION, WHICH IS DESPERATELY NEEDED IN OUR COUNTRY. BRING BACK TTC!\"\n\nSeveral parents have already sued to block the Louisiana measure on exactly those grounds: It promotes a distinct religion, in a nation that's not supposed to establish one. Although the Supreme Court struck down a similar law in Kentucky in 1980, the current court has signaled greater support for religious expression in the public sphere. Instead of creating ironclad rules, the court says it will follow \"history and tradition.\"\n\nBut religious instruction is not as traditional as many of us suppose. Now is the time to remember that history, rather than reinventing a past we never had. That's the only way to create a more just and fair future for all Americans, no matter what faith they might practice.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_zimmerman@inquirer.com", "name": "Jonathan Zimmerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bible"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cecil B.

Proponents said the measure is not solely religious, but that it has historical significance. In the language of the law, the Ten Commandments are \"foundational documents of our state and national government.\"\n\nThese posters must be in place in classrooms by the start of 2025.\n\nSimilar bills requiring the Ten Commandments be displayed in classrooms have been proposed in other states including Texas, Oklahoma and Utah.\n\nIn 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a similar Kentucky law was unconstitutional and violated the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says Congress can \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\"\n\nWe asked our panel: Should the Ten Commandments be displayed in public school classrooms?\n\nProtect the Constitution and freedom of religion\n\nMicheal L. Peterson, northwestern Nevada media specialist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n\nAt this point I don't believe that the Ten Commandments should be required to be posted in public classrooms. We believe in obeying and sustaining the laws of the land and, as of now, the Supreme Court has ruled in 1980 that there is no secular purpose and therefore is unconstitutional. Although the Ten Commandments are a vital part of the Gospel, I lean toward the Constitution, which I believe to be an inspired document and is constantly under threat. We are already in jeopardy of losing our freedom of religion in this country and we should not want the government involved with religion and similarly, we should not have religion involved with government. Interestingly, the state of Louisiana is the only state that requires the Ten Commandments be posted in public classrooms and it will be interesting to see if this law will be heard by the Supreme Court.\n\nYes, if ...\n\nDawn M. Blundell, lead pastor, Epworth United Methodist Church, Fallon\n\nAs a lifelong Christian myself, and a lover of history and world cultures, I believe things like the Ten Commandments can be extremely useful as learning tools. Religion and spirituality play important roles in the lives of many human beings, after all, especially when those human beings group themselves together into cultures and nations. Understanding different beliefs and guiding principles can help us understand ourselves and each other, our histories and our motivations.\n\nThat's the key, though, for me. I am appalled at the idea of displaying only the Ten Commandments. It makes no sense to post them without their context, for one thing. And as Americans, we can't reasonably justify posting these in public schools or government buildings without displaying the basic principles of other world religions and secular groups right beside them. If we did that, then I'd be all for it.\n\nA friend published this Facebook meme: \"Posting the Ten Commandments in Louisiana Public Schools should open the doors for also posting the Five Pillars of Islam, Five Precepts of Buddhism, 613 Jewish Mitzvot, Rastafarian Commandments, Dharma of Hinduism, Five Principles of Shinto, and Diasporic Religion of Haitian Vodou, to mention but a few of the over 6,000 estimated religions practiced on earth.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court previously analyzed similar cases using the question: Was the display \"motivated by a purpose to advance religion?\" Logically, the answer is, yes, that's the goal -- to inculcate youth with Biblical values;'\" thus, not legally allowed. While the Ten Commandments are precious to Judaism, Judaism is not a proselytizing religion. One need not be Jewish, or of any religion -- to be a \"good,\" ethical person, nor to \"reach heaven.\" Thus, we should be fair to each person and respect diverse choices where possible.\n\nNo, for three reasons\n\nStephen R. Karcher, presiding priest, Saint Anthony Greek Orthodox Church\n\nFirst, we should understand the context within which the Ten Commandments were given, and that along with the rest of the Torah and Holy Scripture, they are meant to speak specifically to the community of God's people. It was the Lord who gave the commandments originally, and who completed and fulfilled the Mosaic Law ultimately by sending the Spirit into the hearts and minds of his apostles and disciples. To be extracted from the Torah, taken out of the context of the Church of God and placed on walls in any public-school classroom is reckless. Second, we should avoid weaponizing religion in order to bolster a particular political ideology, as happens in other parts of the world. And third, we shouldn't need to tack up posters to remind us of what is a \"moral life.\" Let's show it by how we live, otherwise we come across as pretenders and martinets.\n\nOur Founding Fathers clearly stated that the government should not select one religion over others as our national religion. If we are to be truly a nation that subscribes to E Pluribus Unum -- \"out of many, one\" -- we must respect the religious beliefs of everyone, a core Baha'i belief.\n\nThe Ten Commandments come directly from the Bible, laden with Judeo-Christian references. Even within them, there are various versions. Therein lies the main problem, without even considering the age-appropriateness of concepts such as adultery!\n\nIf the purpose of posting the Ten Commandments is to teach children moral values, could they be taught without a nod to a particular religion, as my Baha'i friend has done for years? Virtues common to all religions, as well as humanists -- such as honesty, kindness, and justice -- could likely be agreed upon, while the theological particulars could then be reinforced by families and their religious leaders.\n\nSubject to governing authorities\n\nAlex J. Berger, teaching pastor, Summit Christian Church, Sparks\n\nFor me, this conversation starts with Romans 13:1-2: \"Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.\" My understanding of the First Amendment is that government does not establish a national religion and we are each free to practice our faith.\n\nSo, do I personally believe the Ten Commandments should be displayed? No. Should they be prohibited from being discussed in classrooms? No. Christianity is a foundational piece of our nation's history, culture, and morality and can be discussed regarding history.\n\nStudents should be able to talk about their faith and I know many wonderful teachers who don't share my religious beliefs. Why would I require them to comment on my family's religion? That's not fair to the teachers or my kids. However, if someone wants to learn about my faith, they're welcome and free to come visit my church.\n\nOf course not!\n\nKenneth G. Lucey, philosophy/religion professor emeritus, University of Nevada\n\nSome people believe our country was founded as a Christian nation. Nothing could be further from the truth! Our founders were men of the 18th century's \"age of enlightenment\" who believed that reason was the primary source of all authority. Therefore, they made certain from the outset that the American Constitution established separation of church and state. This foundational document prohibits the establishment of any particular religion. Indeed, our Constitution's First Amendment prohibits the government from making any laws \"respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"\n\nThe Ten Commandments of the Bible's Old Testament are core principles of Christianity and Judaism and, well meaning as these principles may be, they have no role in American civic life. Public schools are certainly not the places for them to be taught. Displaying them in publicly funded classrooms verges upon indoctrination.\n\nReligion does not belong in classrooms\n\nMuhammed A. Quddus, member, Northern Nevada Muslim Community\n\nRegardless of one's political affiliation, there is widespread recognition that the American Founding Fathers possessed remarkable talent and foresight. Drawing on their unpleasant direct experiences with the role of religion in the old world, they intentionally designed a constitution to keep religion and government separate. This separation was meant to avert the hazards of state-backed religion, perils that are evident in various regions of the globe today.\n\nWhile the Ten Commandments hold significant meaning for many, their display in public school classrooms is inappropriate. It violates the constitutional principle of separating church and state, compromises the inclusivity of the educational environment, and diverts attention from the primary educational mission of schools. It is crucial to maintain a secular, inclusive educational space to foster a respectful and diverse society.\n\nProminently featuring the tenets of one particular religion marginalizes students of other faiths and creates an atmosphere that is non-conducive to learning.\n\nIn abundant wisdom, our forefathers wrote a constitution that would divide church and state. And with good reason -- many of their ancestors immigrated to escape religious persecution. So, how far will Christian elitism be allowed to go today? Where is the \"moral code\" when we exclude many of our children whose heritage isn't represented by the Ten Commandments? When anyone tries to make a name for themself by clutching at the pearls of an era that didn't exist in the forming of this nation, the rest of us must double our efforts to advocate for equality for all spiritual belief systems.\n\nKing Ur-Nammu, ruler in southern Mesopotamia c. 2112-2094 BCE, is credited as having given us the oldest known surviving example of legal code. Not Moses. Yes, Moses is great, but the Ten Commandments? We can develop relevant tools that aren't exclusionary to raise morally and ethically responsible children.\n\nThorny issue ...\n\nDaniel H. Mueggenborg, bishop, Roman Catholic Diocese of Reno\n\nThere is no \"Catholic\" position on this question so I will offer a merely personal perspective.\n\nLet me begin by stating my support of teaching the Ten Commandments in any legitimate forum where they can be well-received. These commandments contain basic precepts that should be apparent to reasonable people of good will and have similarities with other ancient codes. As such, they are foundational to western society.\n\nHowever, we live in a culture that values free will more than good will. The Ten Commandments will inevitably be seen as an expression of Judeo-Christian faith. Should they be posted in public schools, then groups harmful to the common good could and would request the posting of their teachings as well. I believe the end result of such an action would be a detriment to the formation of our youth. Therefore, I would urge caution in displaying the Ten Commandments in public schools.\n\nNo -- don't play favorites\n\nMatthew T. Fisher, resident priest, Reno Buddhist Center\n\nTen Commandments should not be displayed in classrooms in the U.S. Buddhism respects all religions. We focus on universal truths. These Commandments are one expression of such truths, but not the only one. The government should \"make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" Displaying the Commandments promotes a specific religion (or family of religions) and thereby alienates people/students of other backgrounds. If one, then all -- the essential codes of many religions should be displayed. The government must not play favorites.\n\nThe pluralistic view is the best. We cultivate friendships across faith-lines. We seek out friends of many faiths. Hopefully this question can spark positive dialogue, promoting understanding and respect between faiths. We gather in friendship at interfaith events whenever possible. The misguided action of displaying religious content in schools is exactly the kind of error you don't make when you have friends from other religions.\n\nWe all know the answer to this week's question. It's distressing even to be asked, as if more than one acceptable answer were possible. The question is embarrassing. Isn't it? I don't like it. Not an atheist, though being nonreligious comes into it. Nor do I balk because I'm a Jew, though the Christian Nationalist motivation for mandating the display of the Commandments appalls me. The reason I resist the question is obviously (it should be obvious!) that as an American I know the righteous answer in my bones.\n\nDo you find such a pronouncement self-righteous? Then shame on you! For once I know I speak for most. There's no \"on the one hand, on the other hand\" about it. The issue has a simple right and wrong. Simpler, I dare say, than some of the Big Ten.\n\nWhat more can I say?

Jeff Landry in June, mandates that by January 1, 2025, a poster-sized display of a state-approved version of the Ten Commandments with \"large, easily readable font\" be put in every classroom from kindergarten through the university-level at state-funded schools.\n\nLast month, Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction Ryan Walters issued a memo requiring that schools in the state incorporate the Bible and the Ten Commandments into their curriculum, calling the Bible an \"indispensable historical and cultural touchstone.\"\n\nThe memo came after the state's Supreme Court blocked an effort to establish the first publicly funded religious charger school in the country, CNN previously reported.\n\nPlaintiffs in the Louisiana lawsuit argued mandating that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every classroom renders them \"unavoidable\" and \"unconstitutionally pressures students into religious observance, veneration, and adoption of the state's favored religious scripture.\"\n\n\"It also sends the harmful and religiously divisive message that students who do not subscribe to the Ten Commandments -- or, more precisely, to the specific version of the Ten Commandments that H.B. 71 requires schools to display -- do not belong in their own school community and should refrain from expressing any faith practices of beliefs that are not aligned with the state's religious preferences,\" the complaint continues.\n\nThe lawsuit was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Louisiana, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, on behalf of nine \"multi-faith families\" with students enrolled in Louisiana public schools.\n\nIt names state Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley, several other Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education officials, and some local school boards.\n\nWhen asked about the lawsuit, Brumley told CNN in a statement last month that he looked forward to implementing the law.\n\n\"The Ten Commandments law passed with overwhelming support in Louisiana's state legislature and was enthusiastically signed by our Governor,\" he said. \"I look forward to implementing the law and defending Louisiana's sovereign interest to select classroom content fundamental to America's foundation.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Louisiana is set to become the first state to impose such a requirement, though the action has been debated in other jurisdictions.\n\nThe law in question, House Bill No. 71, mandates that the full text of the Ten Commandments be prominently displayed with a \"context statement\" in each classroom. The context statement stresses that the Ten Commandments are a \"prominent part of American public education.\" Lawmakers claim that the context statement avoids an expressly religious interpretation of the document.\n\nHowever, the plaintiffs argue that the law conflicts with the constitutional requirement of state neutrality towards religion. They filed a lawsuit on July 1 after the bill was signed into law on June 19. In their original complaint, the plaintiffs allege that \"H.B. 71 is not neutral with respect to religion. By design, it expressly requires the display of religious scripture ... and it requires a specific, state-approved version of that scripture to be posted.\" Plaintiffs contend that not even all Christians view the particular version of the Ten Commandments to be authoritative, let alone those of other faiths. They argue that requiring this expression by schools violates the Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\n\nThe injunction seeks to restrain the application of the law until there has been a full trial.

Abashed but nonplussed, Moses presents the Israelites with the, uh, Ten Commandments that are left. I wonder what the other five were.\n\nHold that thought while we consider the 10 that we have.\n\nOn June 19, Louisiana's Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed a bill requiring that the Ten Commandments be displayed in every public classroom from elementary school through university \"on a poster or framed document that is at least eleven inches by fourteen inches\" and \"printed in a large, easily readable font.\"\n\nCritics wonder how this could possibly be constitutional, since the First Amendment's Establishment Clause clearly forbids the government making any law \"respecting an establishment of religion.\" In fact, the courts have rejected efforts of other states -- Kentucky, Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi, South Carolina -- to enforce the posting of the Ten Commandments.\n\nThat's why defenders of the Louisiana law rely on what they say are the Commandments' cultural and historical -- that is, secular -- roots, which is reminiscent of the rationale that the Supreme Court uses to justify religious references such as \"In God We Trust\" on our coinage or \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nThis is sometimes called \"ceremonial deism,\" which protects such usages from Establishment scrutiny because, as Justice William Brennan wrote in 1984, \"they have lost through rote repetition any significant religious content.\"\n\nIn other words, it's OK to have prayers before legislative sessions or to engrave God's name on our nickels precisely because such acts have been drained of their religious content.\n\nIt's hard to see how this is healthy for either Church or State.\n\nIsn't the point of the Ten Commandments that they came directly from God? If you think of them merely in cultural or historical terms, are they really any better than the rules that every culture sets up so that people can live together?\n\nBut here's a bigger problem: It might surprise some proponents of the Louisiana law that the Ten Commandments aren't actually in the Bible. You can find several versions of them in the Old Testament -- Exodus 20, Exodus 34, Deuteronomy 5 -- but the Commandments posted in Louisiana classrooms will be an edited, abbreviated version that leaves out relevant context.\n\nFor example: \"Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.\" But this doesn't mean much without the context: On the sabbath \"thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant [that is, slave], nor thy maidservant [again, slave], nor thy cattle.\" So, on the sabbath, no work. None. By anyone. Got that, kids? This includes homework.\n\nOr: \"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image.\" Why? Because God is a \"jealous\" god who will visit \"the iniquity of the fathers upon the children until the third or fourth generation.\" The context puts teeth into the commandment.\n\nOr: \"Thou shalt not covet.\" The context suggests that this commandment applies only to men, as it forbids coveting your neighbor's house, his manservant [slave], his maidservant [slave], his ass or his wife, but says nothing about coveting your neighbor's husband.\n\nOtherwise, the Commandments provide some rules so obvious -- \"Thou shalt not kill\"; \"Thou shalt not steal\" -- that nearly every culture has adopted some version of them. They're not exactly inspired.\n\nBut back to the five commandments that Moses fumbled in Mel Brooks's imagination. How about these?:\n\nThou shalt not enslave other people.\n\nThou shalt treat men and women exactly the same.\n\nThou shalt not hit the children, ever.\n\nThou shalt not discriminate against anyone, including Black and brown people and LGBTQ+, for I, the Lord thy God, made them all.\n\nThou shalt do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\n\nWhile we're at it, how about a Sixteenth Commandment, from comedian George Carlin's brilliant riff on the Ten Commandments:\n\nThou shalt keep thy religion to thyself.", "source": {"uri": "yakimaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yakima Herald-Republic"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ten Commandments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Establishment_Clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Establishment Clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablets_of_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablets of Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Landry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Landry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Brooks", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mel Brooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sinai", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mount Sinai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israelites", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israelites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceremonial_deism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ceremonial deism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pledge of Allegiance (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_J._Brennan_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William J.

They also sought an expedited briefing and hearing schedule requiring the state to respond by July 19 and for a hearing on July 29, shortly before public schools open in early August.", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kion546.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Supreme_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana Supreme Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9714430", "eventUri": "eng-9714430", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 541, "textEnd": 548}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-29", "textStart": 570, "textEnd": 577}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Jeff Landry was asked to defend his support for a new state law requiring public schools to display a version of the Ten Commandments in public classrooms, he made sure to touch on the bill's obvious religious connections.\n\n\"This country was founded on Judeo-Christian principles, and every time we steer away from that, we have problems in our nation,\" Landry, a Catholic, said during an interview with Fox News.\n\nBut just a few days later, it was Christian clergy -- along with an array of religious leaders and parents of various faiths -- who filed a lawsuit against the new statute, backed by the Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, the Freedom From Religion Foundation and offices of the ACLU.\n\n\"As a minister, this law is a gross intrusion of civil authority into matters of faith,\" the Rev. Jeff Sims, a Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) minister and plaintiff in the case, said in a press conference about the lawsuit. \"It interferes with the administration of God's word, co-ops the word for the state's own purposes, or claims God's authority for the state.\"\n\nThe back-and-forth is part of a broader fight raging across the country, with conservative state lawmakers -- often backed by conservative Christians -- pushing faith-focused laws and running into opposition from other religious people and their secular allies.\n\nOver the past two years, at least 19 states have considered faith-forward legislation, including bills promoting the display or discussion of the Ten Commandments in schools and those allowing for school chaplains. Three states -- Louisiana, Utah and Arizona -- have already passed Ten Commandments legislation, although Arizona's governor vetoed the bill, and Utah's Legislature walked back their initial proposal, with lawmakers ultimately only adding the decalogue to a list of historic documents that can be discussed in class. In addition, Louisiana recently joined two other states -- Texas and Florida -- that have passed laws allowing for chaplains in public school.\n\nAt least one state has achieved similar aims by circumventing the legislative process altogether. Last month, Oklahoma Superintendent of Public Education Ryan Walters issued a directive requiring schools to \"incorporate the Bible, which includes the Ten Commandments, as an instructional support,\" and has said teachers who fail to teach students about the Scripture could risk losing their license.", "source": {"uri": "ncronline.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Catholic

Jeff Landry is satisfied. After he signed the law that mandates all public schools and state-supported universities display the Ten Commandments, Landry courted lawsuits. However, it's imperative to understand the new law isn't about students' rights or religious freedom.\n\nAfter all, students, teachers, school employees can practice their religion without the Louisiana government's ham-fisted insistence and imposition. I wonder if Landry or the Louisiana State Legislature's members display the Ten Commandments in their homes?\n\nState Rep. Dodie Horton, R-Haughton, sponsored the legislation and professes confidence that it will survive legal scrutiny. I imagine she believes in the tooth fairy also. Moreover, Landry engorged with hubris, said, \"If you want to respect the rule of law, you've got to start from the original lawgiver, which was Moses.\" Wrong, Moses was God's intermediary. Moses wrote: \"And the Lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God.\" (Deuteronomy 9:10 KJV)\n\nIn Lemon v. Kurtzman, a 1971 Supreme Court case, the court established a three-pronged criteria in which the government can assist religion: It must have a secular purpose; it can't inhibit or promote a religion, and there can be no excessive church or state entanglement.\n\nHowever, the new court isn't relying solely on the so-called Lemon test. They've concluded that the test that determine a law's constitutionality is whether it complies with the country's history and traditions.\n\nThe Louisiana law is a brazen political move adorned with religious lace. Would Landry's jubilation remain if Hindu, Buddhist or Islamic doctrine adorned the walls?\n\nCourt rulings aside, what hinders any individual from actually obeying the Ten Commandments?\n\nMARC D.

A thunderstorm watch is in place between 10pm tonight and 5am Friday.\n\n\"Rainfall of this intensity can cause surface and/or flash flooding, especially about low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or narrow valleys, and may also lead to slips. Driving conditions will also be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain.\"\n\nBay of Plenty and Tasman are \"two regions where widespread rain accumulations look to reach our heavy rain warning criteria so are covered by orange warnings,\" according to MetService. Both regions have a \"minimal chance\" of being upgraded to red warnings.\n\nA 24-hour orange heavy rain warning applies to Tasman, northwest of Motueka, from 6pm tonight, with between 120-to-150 mm of rain to accumulate. In Bay of Plenty and Rotorua, an orange heavy rain warning applies between 3am and 8pm tomorrow.\n\n\"Clear your drains and gutters to prepare for heavy rain. Avoid low-lying areas and drive cautiously. Streams and rivers may rise rapidly. Surface flooding, slips, and difficult driving conditions are possible,\" MetService suggests.\n\nSeveral other parts of the country are under heavy rain watch between today and tomorrow as the rain moves in from the northwest.\n\n\"The upper half of the North Island is covered with a moderate risk of thunderstorms embedded in the band of rain,\" according to MetService.\n\nA heavy rain watch applies to Northland, Auckland, Coromandel Peninsula, Taupo, Mt Taranaki, and Fiordland north of Doubtful Sound and the ranges of the Westland District.\n\nTwo disturbances in the Tasman Sea were expected to drag tropical moisture into New Zealand from Friday into next week, according to forecaster NIWA.\n\n\"The combined system will produce rounds of heavy rainfall, particularly in the northern and eastern South Island, possibly swirling in the Tasman for up to a week.\"\n\nBy Saturday, most rain will have cleared, but showers look to pepper the western coasts of both the North and South Islands with Sunday likely to bring much of the same.\n\nMetService's Ferris said: \"After a damp day on Friday, there might even be some afternoon sunshine around Mystery Creek on Saturday for those attending Fieldays.\"", "source": {"uri": "1news.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "1 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_District", "type":

The warnings were in Canterbury, West Coast, Tasman, Taranaki and Wellington.\n\nHowever, later in the week forecasters are expecting heavy rainfall to hit the country, possibly reaching warning levels.\n\nNIWA said a \"vigorous sub-tropical jet stream\" will drive the development of a strong, slow-moving low towards the end of this week.\n\nIt said rain and wind may become more widespread, affecting much of the country, and heavy rain and thunderstorms will be a threat.\n\n\"This will coincide with an atmospheric 'stop sign' (blocking high pressure) east of New Zealand, likely leading to widespread rain, some heavy - and it may last a while,\" NIWA said. \"Blocking highs have resulted in high-impact weather across the country in recent years.\n\n\"If you have plans from Friday through next weekend, you'll want to keep an eye on the forecast, as it isn't looking particularly pleasant at the moment.\"\n\nAccording to MetService's severe weather outlook, a northerly flow develops over New Zealand on Wednesday and a front over the Tasman Sea approaches the South Island at night.\n\nThe front moves onto western areas of the country on Thursday, with a low chance rainfall will approach warning criteria in Fiordland and southern Westland, and also about the west of the Tasman District.\n\nOn Friday, the front is expected to cross New Zealand, bringing rain and strong north easterlies to many places.\n\nMetService said there is moderate confidence of \"significant heavy rain\" for the upper South Island, and low confidence over Westland and northern Fiordland, and also the central North Island from Taranaki to East Cape.\n\nThere is also low confidence that north-to-northeast gales could become severe over a large part of the North Island and

These downpours could occur with or without thunderstorms.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Northland driving conditions would be hazardous with surface flooding and poor visibility in heavy rain, MetService said.\n\n\"The thunderstorm and downpour risk initially starts in the Far North this afternoon, then spreads southwards to other parts of Northland this evening.\"\n\nNorthland has a heavy rain watch in place until 11am tomorrow, with a moderate chance of an upgrade to a warning, MetService said.\n\n\"Thunderstorms and localised downpours possible.\"\n\nThere's a low pressure system to the west of the country, MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane said.\n\n\"It is going to be bringing bands of rain over the next few days while it's around.\"\n\nAucklanders and Northlanders are being warned the wet weather could cause surface or flash flooding, especially in low-lying areas such as streams, rivers or valleys, and could also spark slips.\n\nAuckland's heavy rain watch, which also extends to Great Barrier Island and Coromandel Peninsula, is from 8pm today to 2pm tomorrow when periods of heavy rain may approach warning criteria, MetService said.\n\nThunderstorms and localised downpours are also possible, they said.\n\nThe rain should ease to showers in the afternoon, before easing in the evening, although thunderstorms and hail are possible until evening.\n\nDespite the foul conditions, it'll be mild for the time of year, with a high of 18C forecast in Auckland tomorrow, 3C above the June average. A high of 18C is forecast for Whang\u0101rei tomorrow.\n\n\"Northeasterlies [will be] turning southwesterly in the afternoon, fresh in the evening\", they said for Auckland.\n\nThe heavy rain and possible thunderstorms would also likely bring windy conditions, MetService meteorologist John Law said.\n\n\"Especially overnight, Thursday into Friday, into the northern areas.\"\n\nThe watches are among a slew of weather warnings and watches around the country.\n\nA heavy rain warning has been issued for Tasman, northwest of Motueka, from 24 hours from 6pm today, with 120mm to 150mm

any high-risk areas for blocked culverts, and we have arborists and Geotech on standby, should we need them.\"\n\nLynskey said a particular focus was the council's earth dam at Waih\u012b Beach,

of the Central Plateau and blew into Hawke's Bay.\"\n\nThe meteorologist added: \"We also can't ignore climate change -- setting a new national temperature record for June is consistent with

Rates of 25 to 35mm/h are possible in localised downpours and thunderstorms.\n\nRotorua and Tauranga councils were monitoring weather forecasts and taking usual precautions for heavy rain.\n\nRotorua Lakes Council said staff would be checking critical stormwater inlets were clear, ensuring wastewater treatment storage ponds were as empty as possible and that plant systems, including back-up provisions, were operating.\n\nThe council said in a statement residents should check their drains at home and clear debris. They should also have an emergency preparedness plan and ensure everyone in the household was aware of it.\n\nIn preparation for any localised or surface flooding, sandbags could be bought from local hardware stores.\n\nA Tauranga City Council spokesperson said staff were monitoring the weather situation and ready to respond if needed.\n\n\"Right now we are carrying out all our usual checks for when there's significant rain on the radar.\n\n\"If residents need to report an issue they can call our contact centre 24/7 on 07 577 7000.\"\n\nMetService said streams and rivers may rise rapidly and

Zealand from Friday into next week.\n\n\"The combined system will produce rounds of heavy rainfall, particularly in the northern and eastern South Island, possibly swirling in the Tasman for up to a week.\"\n\nMetService meteorologist John Law said the heavy rain and possible thunderstorms would also likely bring windy conditions, \"especially overnight, Thursday into Friday, into the northern areas\", Law said.\n\nFor the South Island, heavy rain is set to come into force for Tasman from 6pm and last for 24 hours.\n\nExpect 120 to 150mm of rain to accumulate and peak rates of 15 to

The thunderstorm and downpour risk initially starts in the Far North this afternoon, then spreads southwards to other parts of Northland this evening.\n\nLocalised downpours between 25-40mm/hr are possible with severe thunderstorms, this might cause some surface flooding in some areas if these totals are reached. The heavy rain watch is in place from 8pm Thursday until 2pm Friday. The severe storm watch is n place from about 10pm tonight and 5am Friday.\n\nAn orange heavy rain warning is in place for Bay of Plenty and Rotorua from 3am until 8pm. Expect 80 to 110 mm of rain to accumulate. Peak rates of 15 to 25 mm/h, but rates of 25 to 35 mm/h possible in localised downpours and thunderstorms.\n\nA heavy rain watch from 6am to 9pm Friday is in place for Taupo, with periods of heavy rain expected. Rainfall may approach warning criteria. Thunderstorms are also possible.\n\nMt Taranaki can expect the same as Taupo - except their watch is in place from 11pm Thursday to 7pm Friday.\n\nAn orange heavy rain warning is in place for Tasman northwest of Motueka from 6pm Thursday to 6pm Friday. Expect 120 to 150 mm of rain to accumulate. Peak rates of 15 to 25 mm/h.\n\nA heavy rain watch is in place for Fiordland north of Doubtful Sound and the ranges of the Westland District from Thursday morning until Friday 4am. Periods of heavy rain are expected, and amounts may approach warning criteria.\n\nWarning to Aucklanders\n\nAuckland Council emergency management general manager Adam Maggs said residents should take precautionary measures before the rain was expected to set in from about 8pm.\n\n\"Just check the drains around the property, if [residents have] got things that are loose and laying around, tuck them away, just do some of those checks that you'd do if you know some weather's coming in,\" he said.\n\n\"We're not expecting huge volumes of rain, but we are expecting lots of showers and messy weather coming from the north and the east.\"\n\nThe northern and eastern parts of the region could see more rain than other areas, Maggs said.\n\nThe rain would likely exacerbate already damp conditions, he said.\n\n\"Soils are saturated, so we're going to see run-off off the land, and there will be localised flooding likely,\" he said.\n\n\"Water's got nowhere to go except basically run-off, so we're likely to see, even with reasonable numbers, some localised flooding on some of our roads, some of the areas that would typically see surface flooding, might see that surface flooding until it's got time to drain away.\n\n\"We're not talking huge volumes of rainfall, just the fact that, at this time of year, we're already pretty wet anyway and we've just got more rain coming.\"\n\nResidents should report any blocked drains or fallen trees to the council.\n\n\"If people see trees down, report a problem on the Auckland Council online website, it's important, and any blocked drains, feel free to call Auckland Council on 09 301 0101, and we'll get that resolved,\" Maggs said.\n\nHe warned rain could still be pouring on Friday morning, and advised motorists to take care on the roads and drive to the conditions.\n\nRNZ", "source": {"uri": "newshub.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newshub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type":

jet stream': Rainmaker brewing over Tasman Sea to drench NZ", "body": "A rainmaker is brewing over the Tasman Sea threatening to bring deluges to the upper North Island later this week.\n\nMetService meteorologist Allan Baillie said the rain will start moving over the country late tomorrow night from the Tasman Sea.\n\nBaillie said the storm is made up of several \"complex lows\", meaning it is a large weather system stretching the length of the country with multiple \"centres\".\n\nHe said it is likely most areas of the country will see at least a little bit of rain, while others will see extended drenchings.\n\nHeavier rainfall would affect areas in the upper North Island, including Auckland, Northland, Bay of Plenty and Coromandel Peninsula.\n\n\"[It also means] the rain distribution differs slightly between the models, so there's quite a bit of doubt at this stage as to where the heaviest [rain will hit],\" Baillie said.\n\nThe lower half of the country is also tipped to see heavy rain as the front crosses the South Island on Thursday night.\n\nFiordland and the south of the Westland District are first in the firing line, followed by Dunedin and North Otago.\n\nThe National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (Niwa) said: \"A vigorous sub-tropical jet stream will drive the development of a strong, slow-moving low later this week.\n\n\"This will coincide with an atmospheric 'stop sign' (blocking high pressure) east of NZ, likely leading to widespread rain, some heavy - and it may last a while.\"\n\nBaillie said the rain will continue into the weekend and possibly linger into Monday and Tuesday next week.\n\n\"There's going to be periods of rain and showers after that main front goes through,\" Baillie said.\n\nThe weather system will also push the unusually warm temperatures out to make space for chillier nights.\n\nMetService meteorologist John Law said temperatures were \"very warm for this time of year\" over the last few days, but that will not last.\n\n\"We have been spoilt with some very unseasonable temperatures but it was a brief blip and we'll be back to something much more familiar for this time of year.\"\n\nWhile New Zealand should expect heavy and widespread rain later in the week, Law said we are looking at a much better few days beforehand.\n\n\"[Today] and Wednesday look pretty good, with much more settled weather.\n\n\"It's worth keeping an eye on the forecast because I think things will go downhill for the rest of the week.\"", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ

Island.\n\nA number of heavy rain watches and warnings are in place around the country from Thursday night until Friday.\n\nAffected residents are being advised to clear drains and gutters, avoid low-lying areas and drive cautiously.\n\nLocal Civil Defence and emergency management groups for Northland, Auckland, Waikato, and Bay of Plenty are reiterating MetService's information on the watches and warnings.\n\nMetService said the weather systems from the Tasman Sea could affect the country into next week.\n\nMeanwhile, National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research said low pressure was forecast to stall in the Tasman Sea for the next week.\n\n\"Areas of vorticity, or atmospheric spin, will 'pinwheel' around the low, bringing semi-regular rounds of rain & thunderstorms to many regions of the country, starting tonight.\"\n\nAuckland Council emergency management general manager Adam Maggs said residents should take precautionary measures before the rain was expected to set in from about 8pm.\n\n\"Just check the drains around the property, if [residents have] got things that are loose and laying around, tuck them away, just do some of those checks that you'd do if you know some weather's coming in,\" he said.\n\n\"We're not expecting huge volumes of rain, but we are expecting lots of showers and messy weather coming from the north and the east.\"\n\nThe northern and eastern parts of the region could see more rain than other areas, Maggs said.\n\nThe rain would likely exacerbate already damp conditions, he said.\n\n\"Soils are saturated, so we're going to see run-off off the land, and there will be localised flooding likely,\" he said.\n\n\"Water's got nowhere to go except basically run-off, so we're likely to see, even with reasonable numbers, some localised flooding on some of our roads, some of the areas that would typically see surface flooding, might see that surface flooding until it's got time to drain away.\n\n\"We're not talking huge volumes of rainfall, just the fact that, at this time of year, we're already pretty wet anyway and we've just got more rain coming.\"\n\nResidents should report any blocked drains or fallen trees to the council.\n\n\"If people see trees down, report a problem on the Auckland Council online website, it's important, and any blocked drains, feel free to call Auckland Council on 09 301 0101, and we'll get that resolved,\" Maggs said.\n\nHe warned rain could still be pouring on Friday morning, and advised motorists to take care on the roads and drive to the conditions.", "source": {"uri":

slow-moving low later this week.\n\n\"This will coincide with an atmospheric 'stop sign' (blocking high pressure) east of NZ, likely leading to widespread rain, some heavy - and it may last a while.\"\n\nLaw said heavier rainfall would affect areas in the upper North Island, including Bay of Plenty, Northland and Auckland.\n\n\"As we go in towards Friday, the area of low pressure adds a bit more circulation which could feed that wet weather into the eastern coast of the South Island into places like Canterbury and Otago.\"\n\nLaw said the unusually warm temperatures won't last when colder air pushes up through the South Island, bringing chillier nights.\n\n\"It's back to what you would expect for June,\" he said.\n\n\"We have been spoilt with some very unseasonable temperatures but it was a brief blip and we'll be back to something much more familiar for this time of year.\"\n\nWhile New Zealand should expect heavy and widespread rain later in the week, Law said we are looking at a much better few days beforehand.\n\n\"Tuesday and Wednesday look pretty good, with much more settled weather.\"\n\nRoad snow warnings are set to come into effect for Lindis Pass and Crown Range Rd from 10pm tonight until early tomorrow morning.\n\nBetween 1-3cm of snow is expected to fall to around 700 metres.\n\nWhile between 5-10cm of snow is expected to fall to around 700 metres on Milford Rd for four hours from 9pm.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_Sea",

This kicks off what looks like a run of generally unsettled weather through into next week.\n\nMetService meteorologist Lewis Ferris states: \"With the band of rain moving onto the upper North Island today our Severe Weather team decided there was enough potential for downpours to issue a Severe Thunderstorm Watch covering Northland and Auckland. There are also Heavy Rain Watches in force.\"\n\nIt's important to note that any downpours associated with the Severe Thunderstorm Watch would be in addition to the widespread rainfall accumulations in the Heavy Rain Watch. As a result, small pockets around Northland and Auckland where downpours occur could experience localised impacts such as flooding and slips.\n\nBay of Plenty and Tasman are the two regions where widespread rain accumulations look to reach our Heavy Rain Warning criteria so are covered by Orange Warnings.\n\nOther parts of the country are under Heavy Rain Watch between today and tomorrow as the rain moves in from the northwest.

This kicks off what looks like a run of generally unsettled weather through into next week.\n\nMetService meteorologist Lewis Ferris states: \"With the band of rain moving onto the upper North Island today our Severe Weather team decided there was enough potential for downpours to issue a Severe Thunderstorm Watch covering Northland and Auckland. There are also Heavy Rain Watches in force.\"\n\nIt's important to note that any downpours associated with the Severe Thunderstorm Watch would be in addition to the widespread rainfall accumulations in the Heavy Rain Watch. As a result, small pockets around Northland and Auckland where downpours occur could experience localised impacts such as flooding and slips.\n\nBay of Plenty and Tasman are the two regions where widespread rain accumulations look to reach our Heavy Rain Warning criteria so are covered by Orange Warnings.\n\nOther parts of the country are under Heavy Rain Watch between today and tomorrow as the rain moves in from the northwest. The upper half of the North Island is covered with moderate risk of thunderstorms embedded in the band of rain.\n\nBy Saturday morning most of the rain will have cleared across the country but showers look to pepper the western coasts of both the North and South Islands with Sunday likely to bring much of the same.\n\n\"After a damp day on Friday, there might even be some afternoon sunshine around Mystery Creek on Saturday for those attending Fieldays,\" Ferris says.\n\nWhile higher parts of the South Island will see some snow during this unsettled period of weather it's unlikely to be the dump of snow to really kick off the season for the skifields.\n\nAs we move past the weekend it looks like more rain is due from the northwest thanks to a large, stagnant, low pressure system which is forecast to park itself in the Tasman Sea over the weekend and hang around into next week.

take cover now:\n\nThis warning is a red warning for a localised area.\n\nWhen extremely severe weather is occurring or will do within the hour.\n\nSevere thunderstorms have the ability to have significant impacts for an area indicated in the warning.\n\nIn the event of a Severe Thunderstorm Red Warning: Act now!\n\nRed Warnings are about taking immediate action:\n\nWhen extremely severe weather is imminent or is occurring\n\nIssued when an event is expected to be among the worst that we get - it will have significant impact and it is possible that a lot of people will be affected\n\nIn the event of a Red Warning: Act now!\n\nOrange Warnings are about taking action:\n\nWhen severe weather is imminent or is occurring\n\nTypically issued 1 - 3 days in advance of potential severe weather\n\nIn the event of an Orange Warning: Take action.\n\nThunderstorm Watch means thunderstorms are possible, be alert and consider action\n\nShow the area that thunderstorms are most likely to occur during the validity period.\n\nAlthough thunderstorms are often localised, the whole area is on watch as it is difficult to know exactly where the severe thunderstorm will occur within the mapped area.\n\nDuring a thunderstorm Watch: Stay alert and take action if necessary.\n\nWatches are about being alert:\n\nWhen severe weather is possible, but not sufficiently imminent or certain for a warning to be issued\n\nTypically issued 1 - 3 days in advance of potential severe weather.\n\nDuring a Watch: Stay alert\n\nOutlooks are about looking ahead:\n\nTo provide advanced information on possible future Watches and/or Warnings\n\nIssued routinely once or twice a day\n\nRecommendation: Plan.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetService", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MetService"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severe weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northland_Region", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Northland Region"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northland Region"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Plenty", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bay of Plenty"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bay of Plenty"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tasman Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storm Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks_and_Watches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Clocks and Watches", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Weather_Beliefs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Folklore/Weather Beliefs", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 55}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9647614", "eventUri": "eng-9647614", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-17", "textStart": 32, "textEnd": 39}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Sullivan liked him, and Warsofsky \u2014 not one to back down \u2014 said he didn\u2019t. \u201cThat was probably the first moment I\u2019m like, \u2018I love this,\u2019\u201d Warsofsky said of catching the coaching bug from Sullivan, a longtime friend from his hometown of Marshfield, Massachusettes now in his 10th year of coaching the Pittsburgh Penguins. \u201cThis is what it\u2019s all about. The preparation, the meetings. He\u2019s been great for me.\u201d Now, roughly 20 years later, Warsofsky is the youngest head coach in the NHL, in charge of bringing the rebuilding San Jose Sharks back to respectability after they finished this past season with the league\u2019s worst record. Warsofsky, just eight years after he began coaching professional hockey, was promoted after he spent two seasons as an assistant under David Quinn, who was fired on April 24. Warsofsky\u2019s rapid rise included two years as an ECHL coach in South Carolina and four years coaching in the AHL with stints in Charlotte and Chicago, winning at every stop, before he was told last week that he was the 11th head coach in Sharks history. \u201cHe\u2019s always won, whatever level he\u2019s been at,\u201d Sharks general manager Mike Grier said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great communicator, which is going to be important. We\u2019re going to have a young group, and speaking with and bonding with these young players is going to be super important.\u201d Grier did not want to be specific about how many people he spoke with about the Sharks coaching job but added that Warsofsky\u2019s familiarity with everyone on the roster aided his candidacy. \u201cWe just went through two really tough years. I know what they need,\u201d Warsofsky said. \u201cThey\u2019re beat up a little bit. We need some new light. We need some energy. We need some positivity. Now we have some hope with the prospects that are coming.\u201d Warsofsky has a huge task ahead of him \u2014 helping to develop those prospects while also trying to move forward after the Sharks finished last season at 19-54-9. The Sharks signed top prospect Will Smith to an entry-level contract last month and are expected to select Boston University\u2019s Macklin Celebrini on the first day of the NHL Draft on June 28 in Las Vegas. Whether Celebrini will turn pro or return to BU for his sophomore season is unclear. But how well the Sharks develop these players and others will go a long way in determining whether they can end a five-year playoff drought sooner rather than later. Warsofsky said he wants the Sharks \u201cto be fast, we want to get on teams. There will be a very distinct look of what our team looks like, I can tell you that right now. Fans will leave our building and say, \u2018Wow, that was a fun team to watch.\u2019 The opponent will say, \u2018Man, that was a tough team to play against.\u2019\u201d All too often in recent years, the rebuilding Sharks were anything but a hard team to play against. This past season, San Jose allowed an NHL-worst 226 goals against during 5-on-5 play, and in two years under Quinn, the Sharks won just 19 of 82 home games, as the formerly formidable SAP Center became a sanctuary for visiting teams. This past season, the Sharks lost 11 times by five goals or more, hitting rock bottom following the trades of Timo Meier, Erik Karlsson, and Tomas Hertl. \u201cThat was a tough year last year, and I take accountability (for) that, too,\u201d Warsofsky said. \u201cBut there\u2019ll be some changes that I think will help correct those mistakes.\u201d Warsofsky didn\u2019t want to discuss specifics about what type of system he\u2019ll employ, especially since the team is getting a makeover this summer, with some prospects and veterans added and others older players jettisoned. \u201cObviously, the numbers weren\u2019t great, the analytics weren\u2019t great,\u201d Warsofsky said. \u201cWe have to make changes. There has to be a system in place that our players know what\u2019s going on. They understand the system. \u201cWhen we have the puck, we know what to do with it, and when we don\u2019t, we know how to get it back.\u201d Warsofsky grew emotional Monday when speaking about everyone who helped him arrive at this point, including his family and longtime friends. Sullivan\u2019s parents are Warsofsky\u2019s grandparents. Warsofsky\u2019s grandmother died when he was young, and Sullivan\u2019s mom became Warsofsky\u2019s grandmother in many respects. \u201c(Sullivan) texted me that (Warsofsky\u2019s grandparents would) be smiling right now,\u201d Warsofsky said, \u201cbecause they\u2019d be very proud.\u201d Other notes from Monday: THE ASSISTANTS: Warsofsky said he\u2019ll speak this week with assistant coaches Scott Gordon, Brian Wiseman, Thomas Speer, and Nick Gialdini about their futures, leaving it unclear whether any of them will return. He did say he will probably have three assistants. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to (Grier) and his staff of how we want to progress,\u201d Warsofsky said, \u201cand go from there.\u201d Warsofsky said it was his priority to bring back goalie coach Speer, who had a good working relationship with Mackenzie Blackwood. THE CAPTAIN: Warsofsky said he\u2019s spoken with Sharks captain Logan Couture a few times this offseason, but not about his health or whether he\u2019ll be ready to go for the start of training camp in September. A sometimes debilitating groin injury kept Couture off the ice for all but six games last season. Warsofsky said his conversations with players have been more about what\u2019s been going on off the ice. Grier did emphasize that he is not looking to trade Couture, who has three more years left on his eight-year, $64 million contract. \u201cIf you look at us bringing in young players here and having a young team,\u201d Grier said, \u201che\u2019s exactly the type of person you want to have around our young players.\u201d THE EX-SHARK: Grier said he spoke with Marco Sturm about the coaching job but added that any reports suggesting Sturm was a finalist were inaccurate. \u201cHe did a good job, and I let him know that Ryan was just a better fit,\u201d Grier said of his conversation with Sturm. \u201cWe had a good conversation about some of the things that maybe, in my view, he can improve for his next job. \u201cBut he\u2019s a good coach and a good person and very passionate about the Sharks.\u201d", "summary": "San Jose Sharks GM Mike Grier on Ryan Warsofsky: \u201cHe\u2019s always won, whatever level he\u2019s been at.\"", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/06/17/warsofsky-era-begins-with-san-jose-sharks-we-need-some-new-light/", "image": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BNG-L-SHARKS-0618-13.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 01:16:09", "author": "Curtis Pashelka", "authors": ["Curtis Pashelka"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.182}

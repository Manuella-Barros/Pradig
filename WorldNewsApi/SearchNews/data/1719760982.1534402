{"id": 225036742, "title": "Caitlin Clark's coach wants her to make two big changes as Fever struggle", "text": "Caitlin Clark is adjusting to the WNBA \u2014 and her coach has a couple of noteworthy suggestions. The Fever rookie, who scored a season-best 30 points in an 88-82 home loss to the Sparks on Tuesday night, needs to work on her mid-range game and spend less time talking to officials. That message came from Indiana head coach Christie Sides after the Fever fell to 1-7 in front of a sellout crowd of 16,013 \u2014 featuring Pacers stars Tyrese Haliburton, Bennedict Mathurin and Andrew Nembhard, former Colts receiver T.Y. Hilton and NFL players Shaquille Leonard and Nick Cross \u2014 at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. \u201cWe\u2019re spending too much time talking to the officials. We\u2019ve got to leave that alone. We\u2019ve got to just play our game and let them do their job and not put it in their hands,\u201d Sides said in a postgame press conference when asked about Clark\u2019s technical foul in the first quarter. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t get technicals. Let me get the technicals.\u201d Clark received a technical foul with 2.7 seconds remaining in the first quarter, for what appeared to be a verbal matter, and Sides had words for her when she pulled her to the side during L.A.\u2019s free throws. Sides did not explain why Clark was assessed the tech. The coach also emphasized that she wanted her players \u2014 specifically Clark \u2014 to focus on their mid-range game ahead of Friday\u2019s eventual 78-73 win against the Sparks. The coach even changed up pre-game shooting drills to work on long two-pointers first, according to The Indy Star. Sides has been vocal about getting Clark \u2014 who\u2019s known for flashy long-range 3-pointers, which made her arguably the greatest shooter in college basketball \u2014 more comfortable in the mid-range. Despite a complete performance by Clark \u2014 the former Iowa product added five rebounds and six assists \u2014 the Fever couldn\u2019t outlast the only other one-win team in the WNBA on Tuesday. Indiana shot just 38.2 percent from the field, and struggled with turnovers and perimeter defense. The Sparks made a season-best 14 3-pointers. Sides explained that the Fever didn\u2019t execute their defensive scheme correctly. \u201cWe were going under some of the screens that we were supposed to be going over on these shooters and we were gambling,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting out of position and then late to where we were supposed to be.\u201d Clark drew eight fouls, the most by any WNBA rookie this season. \u201cI think everybody\u2019s physical with me. They get away with things, you know, probably other people don\u2019t,\u201d Clark said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough, but it\u2019s a very physical game. That\u2019s just professional basketball.\u201d Sides agreed, adding, \u201cThey could probably have called five or six more fouls with the way they keep both hands on her.\u201d Aliyah Boston, the Fever\u2019s No. 1 overall draft pick in 2023, finished with 17 points, six rebounds and two assists.

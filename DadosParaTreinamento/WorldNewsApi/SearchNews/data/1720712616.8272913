Ruggable Ruggable is arguably the hottest rug brand right now. With collaborations from names including Morris & Co, Jonathan Adler, Grey Malin, and Justina Blakeney, it\u2019s not a surprise that in June 2023, a collection was launched with tastemaker and Real Housewife of Beverly Hills Kathy Hilton and her daughter Nicky Hilton Rothschild. Ruggable X The Hiltons has a vintage art deco aesthetic with options that can compliment a range of styles. Like all Ruggable rugs, the material is spill proof, incredibly durable and easily comes clean in a home washing machine or through spot cleaning. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the collaboration. Versatility And Durability As a mom with three children and dogs, Rothschild tells me she was thrilled to discover the brand \u201cI have a beautiful, antique, expensive rug, and it needed to be professionally cleaned. The bill was more expensive than the rug. So, yes, we are huge Ruggable fans.\u201d Bryant Sage & Cream Ruggable Hilton loves Ruggable for similar reasons\u2014because the rugs are just as practical as they are stylish. \u201cThis house is always full, even with the kids grown\u2014they're back here every five, six weeks, and my grandchildren and there are playdates and birthday parties. There are people and three pets, so there's a lot of wear and tear, and the first place you see it is the rug.\u201d MORE FOR YOU India-Pakistan T20 Clash In New York Today: Here\u2019s What To Know About The Biggest Cricket Game Of The Year A Ukrainian Drone Strike May Have Destroyed A Russian Air Force Su 57 Stealth Fighter Hit Man Mows Down Godzilla Minus One As Film Trends Big On Netflix Working Together Not only was this collection a collaboration between the Hiltons and the Ruggable team, but it was also something the mother-and-daughter duo were seeking out. \u201cMy mom and I have been wanting to do something together professionally for a really long time. We love design and decorating. My mom always says every room starts with the rug. So, it just evolved from there.\u201d Diana Trellis Rose Gold Rug Ruggable Creating a versatile line was also important to them. For example, the Diana Trellis Rose Gold Rug is in Hilton\u2019s dining room but also in Rothschild\u2019s daughter\u2019s room. It compliments both spaces perfectly. The Collection Ruggable X The Hiltons Ruggable There are nine different designs in a variety of colorways, sizes, and shapes from rectangular to round, and runner. Chrysler runner Ruggable Each rug is a nod to the home the Hiltons have lived in. For example, the Chrysler rug is named after the New York City landmark. \u201cMy favorite would be the Chrysler because, at night at the Waldorf towers, you see the Chrysler Building all lit up,\u201d says Rothschild. The Trellis Rose Gold Rug is another standout from the collection. It beautifully complements Hilton's living room. \u201cI have fabrics from Colefax and Fowler, Jane Churchill, Old World Weavers and Scalamandre. They're sitting on these rugs, and they fit right in,\u201d she explains. Astoria Rose Gold Ruggable The Astoria Rose Gold rug has a similar colorway. Named after the famed New York City hotel where the family once resided, the tile pattern adds a pop of warmth and texture. On the other hand, the Bryant Sage & Cream has a similar aesthetic to the Trellis Rose Gold but with a fresher, more botanical hue. On the opposite end of the color spectrum is the Brooklawn Latte Brown, which is named for Baron Hilton\u2019s estate, along with the Encatada Ash Brown rug. This one is ideal for a mid century style space. With geometric accents, these are the most modern choices in the collection. Flora Ink Ruggable The Flora Ink and Montecito Indigo rugs also feature dark hues and work gorgeously in contemporary spaces as well as more traditional rooms. Ivory Bel Air rug Ruggable Lastly, the Bel Air rug is available in Ivory and Dark Chocolate. While the Dark Chocolate color is modern, the Ivory version has a more contemporary feel. Timeless At It\u2019s Finest What\u2019s beautiful about these rugs is that they\u2019re an ideal compliant to more traditional or grand millennial homes. Hilton acknowledges there's been a major resurgence of this style in recent years. She tells me, \u201cMy husband is in real estate. So I've seen every house there is. I think people are tired of the big white box.\u201d Fortunately, Ruggable makes it really easy to turn a big white box into a chic home. Follow me on Twitter. Check out my website.

Nile Taylor, 49 \u2014 who is in custody on an assault rap in the fiery Saturday afternoon attack on 23-year-old Petrit Alijaj at the Varick Street station in Manhattan \u2014 has now been charged over a similar Feb. 5 incident at the West 28th Street subway station, too, police said. A man now identified as Taylor can be seen on surveillance footage in the February incident holding two cans of flammable liquid and hurling them at a group of people at the station. No one was hurt in the incident, and the suspect fled and remained on the lam until now. Around 2:45 p.m. Saturday, Alijaj and his fiancee were about to get off a No. 1 train at West Houston and Varick streets as they headed to the Statue of Liberty when Taylor allegedly hurled flaming liquid at him. The burn victim told The Post on Saturday that he used his body to block his girlfriend from the flames. \u201cI protect my fiancee with my body,\u201d he said. Alijaj ended up ripping off his burning shirt while his assailant fled the scene. \u201cI touched myself to put out the fire,\u201d Alijaj recalled. \u201cSo, while I was running, I was burning. \u201cThe doctors said 30% of my body was burnt. But I don\u2019t think it is 30%. Maybe more like 10%,\u201d he said. The victim was taken to New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Hospital to be treated for his burns. Taylor was nabbed by cops about five blocks away at Canal and Renwick streets near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel \u2014 done in by the cell phone he\u2019d swiped off the subway platform afterward, allowing quick-thinking officers to track him down through it. He was being questioned by NYPD detectives and awaiting arraignment Sunday \u2014 as cops identified him as the alleged suspect in the earlier incident, law-enforcement sources said. He is now charged with assault, arson, reckless endangerment and weapons possession in the February case. Taylor also has been arrested for theft of service in a sealed case and criminal possession of a weapon in 1997, sources said. Meanwhile, he isn\u2019t the only alleged vagrant firebug in the transit system. In March, police charged Israel Montero, a Bronx menace with a history of emotional disturbances, with setting a garbage bag on fire on a subway car at the 125th Street station in Manhattan. Montero, 49, even set his own shoes on fire in the May 3 blaze, police said.", "summary": "The deranged nut who tossed flaming liquid at an unsuspecting straphanger also tried to torch a group of commuters at a Manhattan subway station earlier this year, cops said Sunday.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/26/us-news/maniac-who-set-nyc-straphanger-on-fire-was-behind-earlier-similar-incident-cops/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/82732160.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/qLs2b1CM-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:35:30", "author": "Joe Marino,Jorge Fitz-Gibbon", "authors": ["Joe Marino", "Jorge Fitz-Gibbon"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.515}

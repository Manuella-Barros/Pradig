There's no evidence the virus can cause a human outbreak, but authorities are keeping a close eye on the situation. What do we know about the H5N1 virus and how worried should we be?\n\nBird flu is a disease caused by a virus that infects birds and sometimes other animals, such as foxes, seals and otters.\n\nThe major strain - circulating among wild birds worldwide - is a type of the virus known as H5N1. It emerged in China in the late 1990s.\n\nBird migration has led to outbreaks in domestic and wild birds. The virus has in very rare cases infected humans.\n\nScientists say the current risk to humans is low. Transmission from birds to humans is rare and there has been no sustained human-to-human transmission.\n\nThere is no way to predict whether avian flu will trigger a pandemic in humans, but experts are monitoring its spread and studying how it is changing and evolving.\n\nH5N1 is now spreading rapidly in dairy cow herds in the US in what the US Centres for Disease Control, CDC, describes as an \"ongoing multi-state outbreak\".\n\nThe virus's jump into cattle astounded scientists, who thought cows weren't susceptible to it.\n\nIt comes amid another unusual development: In early June, a 59-year-old man in Mexico died with another type of bird flu - H5N2 - which had never before been recorded in people. It is unclear how he got it, although there have been cases in some poultry farms in Mexico.\n\nHealth bodies such as the World Health Organization and the CDC consider the overall public health risk from bird flu to be low. But scientists say we need to keep a close eye on the spread of the virus.\n\n\"This case is one more in a series of developments that collectively could be considered a red flag,\" says Professor Sir Peter Horby, director of the Pandemic Sciences Institute at the University of Oxford.\n\nH5N1 has been on scientists' radar for the past few years, with the virus spreading across all continents. Thousands of outbreaks have been recorded in poultry and wild birds.\n\nThere have been outbreaks in animals farmed for their fur, including mink.\n\nIn late 2023 in Peru, more than 5,000 sea lions died with the virus, which scientists say was caused by the animals' direct contact with infected wild birds.\n\nThe virus has also been detected in foxes, bears, otters, raccoons, cats, dogs, goats and others.\n\n\"It's a virus that's on the march so we've been watching it with concern for that reason,\" says Dr Ed Hutchinson, Senior Lecturer, MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research.\n\nFlu viruses are known for their ability to shape-shift, picking up genes and changing over time as they move outside their natural host.\n\nScientists are watching closely for signs H5N1 might gain a sustained foothold outside poultry and wild birds.\n\nFinding the virus in cattle was \"a real shock\", says Dr Hutchinson.\n\n\"When it turns up in an animal where large numbers of them are farmed and therefore in close proximity with humans that immediately is a reason for paying close attention to it.\"\n\nScientists think the route of transmission is what they call \"artificial\" - the cows are not passing it to one another through natural contact and it probably isn't transmitting in airborne particles from cow to cow.\n\nInstead, they think all the transmission is happening in milking parlours. \"It looks like it's through contaminated milking machinery,\" explains Dr Thomas Peacock from the Pirbright Institute.\n\nThis means that the virus, at the moment, doesn't have the ability to spread naturally from animal to animal. The longer it does go on spreading through dairy herds though, Dr Peacock says, the higher the chance that it evolves in a way that would allow it to do that.\n\nPasteurisation is understood to destroy the virus, but it's estimated that about 5% of Americans consume raw, unpasteurised milk.\n\nAcross the border in Canada, scientists have also begun testing milk.\n\nThere have been cases of humans catching H5N1 from time to time, usually from contact with sick animals, in several countries, including Cambodia, Chile, China, Vietnam, Australia, USA and the UK.\n\nA few hundred human cases have been reported since 1997, around half of whom died.\n\nMore recently, there have been a few cases in US dairy workers, who had only mild symptoms.\n\nMany US states are investing in preventative measures, like protective clothing and goggles for farm workers.\n\nExperts studying the virus say there's no evidence it has morphed into a form that would pose a big threat to humans.\n\nBut as two eminent flu experts warned in an article in the British Medical Journal: \"the hazard and risk of a major outbreak of H5N1 are large, plausible and imminent.\"\n\nVirologist Tom Peacock says the more that it spreads across the US, the higher the chance that the virus gets into humans.\n\nAnd, importantly, the higher the chance that it gets into waterfowl - ducks and geese.\n\n\"That's what we're worried about,\" he tells the BBC. \"Because [those birds] are the ones that one are very susceptible to this, and they seem to be the ones that carry it very large distances.\n\nSome countries are discussing deploying vaccines or are working to secure supplies.\n\nBut with only limited supplies available, any vaccine campaign would be limited, with doses distributed to front line workers including poultry farmers, veterinarians, scientists who study the virus, and people who work on fur farms housing animals like mink and fox.\n\nDr Jayna Raghwani, a biologist from the UK's Royal Veterinary College, points out that, in terms of designing new avian flu vaccines, we are relatively well prepared.\n\n\"We don't have to start from scratch with an influenza virus,\" she says. \"And we have a good understanding of how those [existing flu vaccines] work in order to raise an immune response and be protective.\n\n\"In an ideal world,\" she adds, there would be more surveillance for the virus close to farms.\n\n\"We could do more general monitoring of wildlife close to places we know outbreaks are occurring and more in domestic animals,\" Dr Raghwani says, \"to better understand how the virus changes between species.\"\n\n\"I don't want to downplay concerns about the influenza [circulating in cows],\" says Dr Raghwani. \"But if I was talking to my mum or my grandma about the risk to humans, I would say 'don't worry'.\"\n\nDr Hutchinson puts it this way: \"It's not February 2020 but it does demand our close attention. There are definite risks associated with this and they might not go anywhere but we'd be very foolish not to pay attention to them.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

That pathogen is, of course, bird flu or avian influenza, especially the H5N1 strain.\n\nWhile we're not there yet, nearly all the conditions are ripe for a new pandemic. H5N1 is seemingly everywhere we look. It's in wild birds, factory farm birds, cats, mice and traces of it have shown up in milk thanks to hundreds, if not thousands, of dairy cows that have become the new focal point in this unwinding crisis. But a lot of open questions remain, including if we have the capacity to stop it in time.\n\nBird flu is far from being a new pathogen. Whispers of a \"fowl plague\" date back to the late 19th Century, while H5N1 specifically was first detected in 1996 in Chinese geese. A year later, H5N1 virus outbreaks were detected in poultry in Hong Kong, infecting 18 people and killing six. That's around when virologists and public health experts noticed H5N1 is a particularly nasty bug with broad pandemic potential and have been closely monitoring it ever since.\n\nOver the years, it has sprung up and disappeared again and again, infecting about 900 people, killing 463 to date. That gives it a severe death rate of 52%, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nBut our current situation -- the one that is becoming increasingly harder to ignore -- really began about three years ago, when bird flu began spreading rapidly in wild birds, massacring millions of them. It alarmed experts who reported it even threatened to wipe out entire colonies of penguins in Antarctica. But it became even more alarming when the virus began spreading more easily in mammals. It killed hundreds of sea lions and walruses, but also began to kill house cats and other wild animals.\n\nBirds peck at food intended for dairy cattle (Getty Images/Dusty Pixel photography)\n\nThis is concerning because spreading in mammals means it's more likely to infect humans. The 1918 swine flu virus H1N1, which killed an estimated 20 million people, had both mammalian and avian genetics. For context, SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind COVID, has infected approximately 775 million people globally and has so far killed about 7 million people, giving it around a 1% death rate. (COVID is no longer surveilled as much as before, however, so these numbers are most likely an undercount.)\n\nAnd now things in the U.S. have seemingly reached a crescendo, in which dairy cows are harboring the virus, spreading it amongst each other and even killing cows in some instances. So far, outbreaks in more than 100 dairy farms in 12 states have been reported, but experts have said that cases are likely flying under the radar. So far this year, three Americans have been infected by H5N1 viruses that started in cows, and all of them recovered, but some experts say that patients may be avoiding doctors or refusing tests.\n\nNaturally, another pandemic emerging is a huge risk. But how severe is this situation really? And what can be done to make sure it doesn't reach a devastating worst case scenario?\n\nThe definition of a \"pandemic\" varies. An epidemiology dictionary defines a pandemic as one step above an epidemic, which is sudden, widespread occurrence of infectious disease. According to this definition, an influenza pandemic would occur when \"almost simultaneous transmission takes place worldwide.\"\n\nWhen H1N1 began to spread in 2009, experts characterized it as a pandemic due to its proliferation across both hemispheres. The WHO has three criteria that must be met in order for a pandemic to be declared: First, it must be a new strain that has not circulated among humans before. So while HIV was a pandemic in the '80s, today it is not considered such. Second, it must infect humans and cause serious illness. Lastly, it must spread efficiently among humans.\n\nWant more health and science stories in your inbox?

Despite there not being an \"official definition of what constitutes a pandemic,\" it is generally when there is sustained transmission of humans worldwide.\n\nA pelican suspected to have died from H5N1 avian influenza is seen on a beach in Lima, on December 1, 2022. (ERNESTO BENAVIDES/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\"We are not close to this, given it's not spreading human-to-human yet,\" Jetelina said.\n\nTo date, there have only been three human cases of bird flu associated with the outbreak of U.S. dairy cows. Nonetheless, it's still worrying because in the latest confirmed case, respiratory symptoms were reported (unlike the other two cases), which means the virus could be evolving ways to spread more easily.\n\n\"The bovine situation is a step up from this, just due to how widespread the virus is, and how many people have exposure to cattle (compared to small mink farms or remote sea lion colonies),\" Dr. Tom Peacock, a virologist at Imperial College London and the Pirbright Institute, told Salon. \"This clearly represents a much larger human-animal interface than the other examples. Pandemics occur when the unlikely event of one of these influenza viruses gets the right combination of mutations. It's a little like buying a lottery ticket -- this outbreak is allowing the virus to bulk buy lottery tickets.\"\n\nAccording to a report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in December 2023, there had been 902 cases of bird flu in humans in 23 countries since 1997. These cases had a cumulative case fatality proportion of greater than 50 percent.\n\nNotably, the three recent cases that have been associated with the outbreak among dairy cattle in the U.S. have been categorized as \"mild.\" Only one had respiratory symptoms. Still, experts say that bird flu in humans is \"deadly.\" To put it in context of the 1918 flu pandemic, experts estimate that it had a 2.5 percent mortality rate.\n\nRasmussen said this is a difficult question to address, in regards to how \"deadly\" the bird flu is.\n\n'\"Deadly' might depend on the host species. The viruses circulating in cattle appear to not cause severe disease in them and haven't yet caused severe disease in the known human cases,\" she said. \"The 'highly pathogenic' term for avian influenza viruses refers to severity in birds.\"\n\nHowever, she said, we do know that HPAI H5N1 viruses -- like the one circulating in cattle -- can be lethal in humans.\n\n\"We don't fully understand what determines how severe disease will be in one species or one individual over another and this is an important and critical area of research,\" she said.\n\n\"I don't think we know enough [data] yet to make conclusions about this,\" Peacock said. \"Similar viruses are circulating in wild birds as well in the U.S., for example. There is a lot of variability in reports about how deadly H5N1 is, a lot of this is due to ascertainment issues (i.e. lots of mild or asymptomatic cases never being detected) and it may also be partly due to virus dose and exposure route (inhaling high titre virus contaminating liquids versus getting milk splashed in someone's eye.)\"\n\nBird flu has been the cause of death for millions of wild and domestic birds worldwide. It's also been extremely deadly in seals, sea lions and minks. It has wiped out cats, foxes and even a polar bear. As it stands, it doesn't seem to be as deadly in cows -- which is the host humans are likely getting an infection from, but some cows did get so sick they had to be euthanized.\n\n\"It seems that the death rate is far lower in cows than other animals we've seen, like birds and cats,\" Jetelina said. \"Unfortunately, we don't know why. There is so much we don't understand about the pathophysiology of what makes it more lethal for one animal than another.\"\n\nWhile it seems that many of the infected cattle have recovered, Rajnarayanan said \"there are anecdotal reports of very sick cattle and a few dead and culled dairy cattle.\"\n\nEarlier this month, WHO shared that a 59-year-old patient died of H2N2 in Mexico. It was the first laboratory-confirmed case of H2N2 globally, and the first reported case in Mexico. But notable, it is a different strain than the bird flu strain that is circulating in livestock in the United States. (The H and the N in these names refer to specific proteins on the virus, which can significantly differ in how they infect and cause illness.)\n\nMore recently, WHO clarified that the man died from separate health conditions, though the patient did test positive for bird flu. Experts who Salon spoke with said they weren't concerned about this case.\n\n\"The H5N2 is concerning because someone died and that is always sad, however, Mexico vaccinates for H5 flu and it is endemic in the bird population,\" Dr. Keith Poulsen, an associate professor of large internal medicine at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told Salon. \"Same in Asia; every once in a while we see an outbreak or a single person die -- the outbreaks are rare, but are important.\"\n\nOne of the most prevalent criticisms of the federal agencies tasked with surveilling and curtailing this virus is that testing is scarce, delayed and lacking transparency.\n\n\"Testing still seems somewhat random and voluntary. We should be doing more -- both in cattle and humans,\" William Hartmann, an assistant professor of anesthesiology and principal investigator for the UW-Madison COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Program, told Salon.\n\n\"I would prefer to see more testing of farm workers and milk,\" Dr. Daniel Goldhill, a lecturer in virology at the Royal Veterinary College at University of London, told Salon. \"I would like to see serology to see if workers were infected asymptomatically. In terms of virus sequencing data, releasing the sequences is a positive step though more metadata such as sample date and state or farm would be helpful.\"\n\nWith at least 25 confirmed infected herds, Michigan seems to have the most outbreaks (though recently surpassed by Idaho with 26) but that's because they are doing more testing than most other places.\n\n\"I don't think people were surprised when additional cases were found in Michigan,\" Goldhill said. \"Other states do not seem to be tracking human symptoms as well as Michigan, so it is possible that human cases have been missed. Without doing serology testing, we will not be able to know if we have missed cases.\"\n\n\"States that are testing more are likely to report more cases. Test positivity is the key to gauge the spread,\" Rajnarayanan said. In the meantime, \"we definitely are not testing enough,\" he said.\n\nPoulsen said commercially available tests are already available.\n\n\"Anyone can buy PCR and ELISA tests,\" he said. \"They are not idiot proof, like at home COVID tests, nor should they be, because we want them to be accurate. That means trained people with sophisticated equipment with a low error rate.\"\n\nHe added there is no \"CLIA requirement for animal testing,\" referring to federal lab standards and private labs can do all the testing they want. There is also no legal requirement to report test results, but there is no way to enforce that effectively. Moreover, he said, the infrastructure is there for testing.\n\n\"We are ready and equipped to test,\" he said. \"We just need industry, the states, or the USDA to allow us to do so.\"\n\nJetelina said that even at-home flu tests will likely pick up H5N1 because it's closely related to influenza A.\n\n\"The big challenge will be fall, as we will not be able to differentiate between [seasonal] flu and H5 unless we have a more specific test,\" she said.\n\n\"I think that COVID demonstrated both the best and the worst about vaccines,\" Goldhill said. \"We produced an amazing vaccine but people still died due to vaccine hesitancy and inequitable distribution of vaccines. Current flu vaccines are not as effective as mRNA vaccines were against COVID. It will be interesting to see how well mRNA vaccines work against flu. In any case, it takes a significant amount of time to make a vaccine, during which the virus would be able to spread.\"\n\nA rooster is held in a cage on a farm on January 23, 2023 in Austin, Texas.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\n\nDespite conservative news outlets pushing the sales of raw milk, scientists unanimously agree that it's not a good idea to drink it. Pasteurization is a process most commercial milk goes through that kills not only viruses but bacteria and other pathogens that may be present in dairy.\n\n\"Raw milk from sick cows has a good load of viable virus, while the exact risk to humans is not known,\" Rajnarayanan said. \"It's playing with wildfire when you consume raw milk loaded with a viable virus.\"\n\nNotably, cats that consumed raw milk from infected cows died.\n\n\"Even without a H5N1 outbreak in cows, raw milk is not safe because of bacteria that can severely sicken people,\" Jetelina said. \"There's a reason why we have had pasteurization for over 100 years -- nit works.\"\n\nWith H5N1, she said, there is added unknown risk.\n\n\"We know that it is in raw milk, however how sick it will make people is still under investigation,\" she said. \"The risks, though, are presumed to greatly outweigh benefits.\"\n\n\"I am starting to worry more now,\" Hartmann said. \"The virus wants to make a successful jump from birds to cows and to humans. It continues to spread in herds [and] has changed in humans to some extent as well. The first two confirmed cases had only conjunctivitis, this last individual developed respiratory illness. Once it gets to the lungs, it becomes much easier to spread. These are reasons to really be alert.\"\n\nPoulsen said he is worried that the virus will become endemic in the country's dairy cattle population, which could create significant long-term health and productivity problems.\n\n\"The longer that this virus is allowed to propagate unchecked, the risk of human health problems goes up,\" Poulsen said. \"I worry now that we are not doing effective surveillance and we are not providing industry with the tools they need to control the disease.\"\n\nHe added that if the H5N1 variant that is circulating, it becomes endemic.\n\n\"We do not want H5N1 that is circulating to become endemic and be in the same position as Asia and Mexico, but we are handling the disease in a similar way,\" Poulsen said.\n\nIndeed, most experts expressed a concern that the lack of data and surveillance is a major issue. Jetelina said the government isn't doing \"even close to enough\" testing on animals and humans.\n\n\"I don't think it's because they don't want to, but rather there are very real challenges on the ground, including lack of trust,\" she said. \"Building partnerships with the front line is the most urgent thing we need to do to get a better handle on this.\"\n\nRasmussen said part of the issue with testing is that it requires a collaboration between multiple state and local agencies, as well as the USDA and CDC, which don't always cooperate. It also requires participation and consent from the affected farms.\n\n\"As a result it's hard to know how much testing has been done and how much will be done going forward,\" Rasmussen said. \"It can differ a lot by jurisdiction.\"\n\nPoulsen elaborated and said there are too many \"legal and political barriers\" to testing, and that the laws differ for poultry and cattle.\n\n\"I will start worrying once wastewater H5 levels increase in a location and it starts to correlate with an increase in human cases,\" Rajnarayanan said. \"If we wait till it starts translating into ER department visits and hospital ICUs, then it will be too late.\"", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here's what it might look like", "body": "No forms of the bird flu virus seem to have spread efficiently from person to person, but that is no guarantee that H5N1 will not acquire that ability, says an expert on the disease\n\nTHE bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle has so far spilled over to just three farmworkers in the United States, as far as public health authorities know. All of them have had mostly mild symptoms.\n\nBut that does not guarantee that the virus, called H5N1, will remain benign if it begins to spread among people. Accumulating evidence from the animal world and data from other parts of the globe, in fact, suggest the opposite.\n\nSome dairy cows never recovered from H5N1, and died or were slaughtered because of it. Infected terns seemed disoriented and unable to fly. Elephant seal pups had trouble breathing and developed tremors after catching the virus. Infected cats went blind, walking in circles; two-thirds of them died.\n\n\"I definitely don't think there is room for complacency here,\" said Anice Lowen, a virologist at Emory University.\n\n\"H5N1 is a highly pathogenic type of influenza virus, and we need to have a high degree of concern around it if it's spilling over into humans,\" she said.\n\nIn ferrets experimentally inoculated with the virus through their eyes - the presumed route of infection in the US farmworkers - the virus rapidly spread to their airways, lungs, stomach and brain, according to a report published last Wednesday (Jun 12).\n\nOther studies have found similar patterns in mice fed contaminated milk. The findings suggest that entry through the eyes or digestive system ultimately may not make the virus any less a threat.\n\nH5N1 has shown itself to be promiscuous, rapidly gaining new hosts - wild birds and poultry, mice and bears, cats and sea lions. Since its discovery in 1996 in Hong Kong, it has also infected nearly 900 people.\n\nAn older version of the virus circulating in Asia has killed about half of those infected.\n\nOf the 15 people known to have been stricken with the version that is now circulating in cattle, one in China died and another was hospitalised. Two patients in Chile and Ecuador had severe symptoms. Four Americans - one last year and the three infected with the latest outbreak - have fared better.\n\nCrucially, no forms of the bird flu virus seem to have spread efficiently from person to person. That is no guarantee that H5N1 will not acquire that ability, said Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist and bird flu expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\n\"I think the virus is clearly changing its property, because we never saw outbreaks in cows,\" Kawaoka said.\n\nConjunctivitis, also known as pink eye and the primary symptom in two of the three farmworkers, is not typical of H5N1 infection. The appearance of the virus in mammary glands - in cattle and even in non-lactating mice - was also unexpected.\n\nThe worry now is that as H5N1 continues to infect mammals and evolve, it may pick up the mutations needed to spread efficiently among people, setting off another pandemic.\n\nThe incubation period for flu is two to four days, and a human-to-human version could spread far before cases were detected, said Erin Sorrell, a virologist and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\n\"If it goes into the general public, it's too late,\" she said. \"We've missed the boat.\"\n\nFlu is typically most severe in older adults and children younger than five. (An outbreak of swine flu in 2009 was not as devastating as feared, yet it killed nearly 1,300 children.) The severity of illness also depends on how much virus the infected patients are exposed to and for how long, as well as the route of entry and their genetic background and general health.\n\nInfected people generally have fever and respiratory symptoms; some cases advance quickly to pneumonia or death. If the bird flu virus were to adapt to people, the world would need billions of doses of vaccines and antivirals to stave off these outcomes.\n\nThe federal stockpile holds four types of flu antivirals, but the drugs must be taken within 48 hours of symptom onset to be effective. One recent review found too little evidence to gauge the effectiveness of three of the four drugs, including the commonly used oseltamivir, sold as Tamiflu.\n\nSome new versions of H5N1 have mutations that make the virus resistant to oseltamivir and to the other two drugs, but those changes, fortunately, have not been widely transmitted in animal populations. No mutations have been observed against the fourth drug, baloxavir.\n\nBut there are only a few hundred thousand doses of that drug in the stockpile, according to David Boucher, the infectious disease director of the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.\n\nVaccines are a better bet to stem a pandemic, but enough doses are not likely to be available for many months, at the least. Even if global production of seasonal flu vaccines were entirely shifted to vaccines against H5N1, the number of doses manufactured would be enough for fewer than two billion people, assuming two doses were needed for each person.\n\nIn the United States, the national stockpile holds hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses that could be rolled out to those at risk, including children. Companies contracting with the government could make more than 100 million doses in the first 130 days, Boucher said.\n\nOfficials recently announced that they had taken steps to ready 4.8 million doses that could be bottled without disrupting seasonal flu vaccine production.\n\nBut most of these plans will help only if the virus cooperates.\n\nSince H5N1's first appearance, it has branched into many forms, and scientists have created a library of 40 so-called candidate vaccine viruses to match. Having them ready to go saves crucial time, because creating a new candidate can take three months, said Todd Davis, a virologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSo far, he said, the virus has changed only minimally, especially the part of the virus that binds to human cells, called hemagglutinin or HA.\n\nIf the virus were to spread among people, it would first have to change significantly, some experts noted.\n\n\"If this virus jumps into humans, you can bet that the HA is going to change, because right now the HA of this virus does not bind very effectively to human cells,\" said Scott Hensley, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTraditional flu vaccines are made by growing candidate viruses in eggs or in mammalian cells, both of which are fraught with potential problems: The virus may not grow quickly enough, or it may mutate too much as it grows.\n\nIn 2009, the candidate virus grew well in eggs but evolved into a poor match for wild H5N1 virus, introducing long delays in distribution to the public. \"By the time the vaccine stocks were made and distributed, the initial wave of pandemic had already subsided,\" Hensley said.\n\nCSL Sequiris, a leading manufacturer of seasonal flu vaccines, has a cell-based H5N1 vaccine that is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn the event of a pandemic, once CSL receives a candidate vaccine virus that matches the circulating virus, it could provide 150 million doses for Americans within six months, said Marc Lacey, an executive director at the company. (The firm also has contracts with 19 other countries.)\n\nBut 150 million doses would protect only about one in five Americans. Federal officials also are exploring mRNA bird flu vaccines, which could be made very quickly, as the Covid pandemic illustrated, to protect both cows and people. Hensley's team is testing an mRNA vaccine in cows.\n\nOfficials have hesitated to deploy vaccines for cows because of trade concerns, experts said. Some countries bar imports of products from vaccinated birds and animals.\n\nBut immunising cows would curb the risk to farmworkers, and to other cows, and limit the opportunities for the virus to keep spreading and evolving, experts said.\n\nSo far, federal officials have also been reluctant to vaccinate farmworkers, saying that the risk is still low.\n\nThe real danger, Lowen of Emory said, is if a farmworker becomes infected with both H5N1 and a seasonal flu virus. Flu viruses are adept at swapping genes, so a co-infection would give H5N1 opportunity to gain genes that enable it to spread among people as efficiently as seasonal flu does.\n\nThe possibility underscores the importance of vaccinating farmworkers, Lowen said.\n\n\"Anything we can do to limit seasonal infection in people that are occupationally exposed to H5N1 could really reduce risk.\"

Here's What It Might Look Like.", "body": "The bird flu outbreak in dairy cattle has so far spilled over to just three farmworkers in the United States, as far as public health authorities know. All of them have had mostly mild symptoms.\n\nBut that does not guarantee that the virus, called H5N1, will remain benign if it begins to spread among people. Accumulating evidence from the animal world and data from other parts of the globe, in fact, suggest the opposite.\n\nSome dairy cows never recovered from H5N1, and died or were slaughtered because of it. Infected terns seemed disoriented and unable to fly. Elephant seal pups had trouble breathing and developed tremors after catching the virus. Infected cats went blind, walking in circles; two-thirds of them died.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\n\"I definitely don't think there is room for complacency here,\" said Anice Lowen, a virologist at Emory University.\n\n\"H5N1 is a highly pathogenic type of influenza virus, and we need to have a high degree of concern around it if it's spilling over into humans,\" she said.\n\nIn ferrets experimentally inoculated with the virus through their eyes -- the presumed route of infection in the U.S. farmworkers -- the virus rapidly spread to their airways, lungs, stomach and brain, according to a report published Wednesday.\n\nOther studies have found similar patterns in mice fed contaminated milk. The findings suggest that entry through the eyes or digestive system ultimately may not make the virus any less a threat.\n\nH5N1 has shown itself to be promiscuous, rapidly gaining new hosts -- wild birds and poultry, mice and bears, cats and sea lions. Since its discovery in 1996 in Hong Kong, it has also infected nearly 900 people.\n\nAn older version of the virus circulating in Asia has killed about half of those infected.\n\nOf the 15 people known to have been stricken with the version that is now circulating in cattle, one in China died and another was hospitalized. Two patients in Chile and Ecuador had severe symptoms. Four Americans -- one last year and the three infected with the latest outbreak -- have fared better.\n\nCrucially, no forms of the bird flu virus seem to have spread efficiently from person to person. That is no guarantee that H5N1 will not acquire that ability, said Yoshihiro Kawaoka, a virologist and bird flu expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\n\"I think the virus is clearly changing its property, because we never saw outbreaks in cows,\" Kawaoka said. Conjunctivitis, also known as pink eye and the primary symptom in two of the three farmworkers, is not typical of H5N1 infection. The appearance of the virus in mammary glands -- in cattle and even in nonlactating mice -- was also unexpected.\n\nThe worry now is that as H5N1 continues to infect mammals and evolve, it may pick up the mutations needed to spread efficiently among people, setting off another pandemic.\n\nThe incubation period for flu is two to four days, and a human-to-human version could spread far before cases were detected, said Erin Sorrell, a virologist and a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\n\"If it goes into the general public, it's too late,\" she said. \"We've missed the boat.\"\n\nFlu is typically most severe in older adults and children younger than 5. (An outbreak of swine flu in 2009 was not as devastating as feared, yet it killed nearly 1,300 children.) The severity of illness also depends on how much virus the infected patients are exposed to and for how long, as well as the route of entry and their genetic background and general health.\n\nInfected people generally have fever and respiratory symptoms; some cases advance quickly to pneumonia or death. If the bird flu virus were to adapt to people, the world would need billions of doses of vaccines and antivirals to stave off these outcomes.\n\nThe federal stockpile holds four types of flu antivirals, but the drugs must be taken within 48 hours of symptom onset to be effective. One recent review found too little evidence to gauge the effectiveness of three of the four drugs, including the commonly used oseltamivir, sold as Tamiflu.\n\nSome new versions of H5N1 have mutations that make the virus resistant to oseltamivir and to the other two drugs, but those changes, fortunately, have not been widely transmitted in animal populations. No mutations have been observed against the fourth drug, baloxavir.\n\nBut there are only a few hundred thousand doses of that drug in the stockpile, according to David Boucher, the infectious disease director of the federal Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response.\n\nVaccines are a better bet to stem a pandemic, but enough doses are not likely to be available for many months, at the least. Even if global production of seasonal flu vaccines were entirely shifted to vaccines against H5N1, the number of doses manufactured would be enough for fewer than 2 billion people, assuming two doses were needed for each person.\n\nIn the United States, the national stockpile holds hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses that could be rolled out to those at risk, including children. Companies contracting with the government could make more than 100 million doses in the first 130 days, Boucher said.\n\nOfficials recently announced that they had taken steps to ready 4.8 million doses that could be bottled without disrupting seasonal flu vaccine production.\n\nBut most of these plans will help only if the virus cooperates.\n\nSince H5N1's first appearance, it has branched into many forms, and scientists have created a library of 40 so-called candidate vaccine viruses to match. Having them ready to go saves crucial time, because creating a new candidate can take three months, said Todd Davis, a virologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nSo far, he said, the virus has changed only minimally, especially the part of the virus that binds to human cells, called hemagglutinin or HA.\n\nIf the virus were to spread among people, it would first have to change significantly, some experts noted. \"If this virus jumps into humans, you can bet that the HA is going to change, because right now the HA of this virus does not bind very effectively to human cells,\" said Scott Hensley, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nTraditional flu vaccines are made by growing candidate viruses in eggs or in mammalian cells, both of which are fraught with potential problems: The virus may not grow quickly enough, or it may mutate too much as it grows.\n\nIn 2009, the candidate virus grew well in eggs but evolved into a poor match for wild H5N1 virus, introducing long delays in distribution to the public. \"By the time the vaccine stocks were made and distributed, the initial wave of pandemic had already subsided,\" Hensley said.\n\nCSL Sequiris, a leading manufacturer of seasonal flu vaccines, has a cell-based H5N1 vaccine that is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIn the event of a pandemic, once CSL receives a candidate vaccine virus that matches the circulating virus, it could provide 150 million doses for Americans within six months, said Marc Lacey, an executive director at the company. (The firm also has contracts with 19 other countries.)\n\nBut 150 million doses would protect only about 1 in 5 Americans. Federal officials also are exploring mRNA bird flu vaccines, which could be made very quickly, as the COVID pandemic illustrated, to protect both cows and people. Hensley's team is testing an mRNA vaccine in cows.\n\nOfficials have hesitated to deploy vaccines for cows because of trade concerns, experts said: Some countries bar imports of products from vaccinated birds and animals.\n\nBut immunizing cows would curb the risk to farmworkers, and to other cows, and limit the opportunities for the virus to keep spreading and evolving, experts said.\n\nSo far, federal officials have also been reluctant to vaccinate farmworkers, saying that the risk is still low.\n\nThe real danger, Lowen of Emory said, is if a farmworker becomes infected with both H5N1 and a seasonal flu virus. Flu viruses are adept at swapping genes, so a co-infection would give H5N1 opportunity to gain genes that enable it to spread among people as efficiently as seasonal flu does.\n\nThe possibility underscores the importance of vaccinating farmworkers, Lowen said: \"Anything we can do to limit seasonal infection in people that are occupationally exposed to H5N1 could really reduce risk.\"",

For the past couple of decades, global health agencies have kept tabs on the virus, which is most well known for decimating poultry flocks and infecting wild birds, while mammalian and human cases have been rare.\n\nYet the current spate of outbreaks, first detected in Europe in Fall 2020, has drawn particular concern and attention. Unlike in prior outbreaks, mammalian infections have become significantly more common, and many mammal species including pet cats, seals, foxes, mice, skunks, bobcats, and even a bottlenose dolphin have been falling ill and testing positive for the flu. Also unlike in past outbreaks, some mammals seem to be spreading the virus among themselves, indicating that H5N1 has mutated to be more easily transmissible beyond birds.\n\nIn one of the latest developments, dairy cows in the U.S. have begun contracting the influenza subtype, shedding it in their milk. An outbreak first detected in Texas in March has now impacted at least 12 states, with cases so far reported on 90 dairy farms nationwide- numbers many experts believe to be an underestimate.\n\n\"Avian influenza is something that most people in epidemiology, infectious disease, and pandemic preparedness have been worried about for a long time,\" says Nahid Bhadelia an infectious disease physician and the founding director of Boston University's Center on Emerging Infectious Disease. \"What's different about the current scenario is that you are seeing possible changes in the way that the virus is now infecting animals, to the point where it's closer to where human beings are-both geographically and physiologically,\" she tells Popular Science.\n\nLivestock and humans exist in close proximity, particularly in the case of dairy cows, which have to be regularly milked by dairy workers. With more human-animal contact opportunities, the virus, which has already spilled over from wild birds into dozens of species around the world, could continue to mutate and eventually become readily transmissible between people, Bhadelia says. Sustained human transmission would be a step towards a bird flu pandemic that hasn't been observed before.\n\nSince 1997, 912 human cases of H5N1 have been confirmed globally, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The large majority of these infections were in people with close contact to infected animals. A small portion of cases are believed to be attributable to human-to-human transmission, but sustained human-to-human transmission hasn't been seen.\n\nIn the current outbreak, three human cases of H5N1 have been reported in the U.S., all mild infections in dairy workers. To mitigate the risk of many more human cases, experts say we need proactive efforts involving virus surveillance, multiple types of testing and data collection, robust communication and information sharing, new biosecurity strategies, worker safety protections, and improved vaccines.\n\nUltimately, we can't control how a virus' genome changes, and we can't entirely avoid the possibility of another flu pandemic, says William Schaffner, a physician and infectious disease professor at Vanderbilt University. What we can do is try to reduce risk and control how we prepare for it. Testing, multiple sources say, is a big part of that.\n\n\"Everyone agrees, I think, that we would love to do much more testing than we're doing at the present time,\" Vanderbilt says.\n\n\"There should be more testing,\" in more states, of more animals, of more people, and of environmental proxies for viral spread like wastewater, says Bhadelia.\n\n\"Where I really think we should be focused is testing of farmworkers and testing of animals,\" Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at New York University and the Kaiser Family Foundation, tells Popular Science.\n\n\"We don't have what we need to be making effective decisions. The number one priority I would identify is we need to be doing a lot more surveillance,\" says Rachael Piltch-Loeb, an assistant professor of public health and policy at the City University of New York.\n\nThough testing alone doesn't stop viral spread, it provides key information about where and how that spread is happening. \"Not knowing is never a good thing,\" emphasizes Shaffner. Currently, there are lots of unanswered questions about H5N1 in cows and people. We don't know how often exposed animals or people become infected, we don't know everywhere the virus is currently spreading, we don't know if it is moving through airborne transmission or just contact with contaminated equipment and milk droplets.\n\nIn past human cases, the fatality rate for H5N1 has been about 50%. But none of the three recently infected U.S. workers have died or even gotten severely ill. Why is \"one of the great mysteries,\" Bhadelia says, though she adds that that historical fatality rate is likely a big overestimate. Often only the most severe infections are documented early in a virus' emergence and multiple factors like differences in transmission route, viral mutations, and who is getting sick and where can drastically shift disease outcomes. But still, we need testing to know more.\n\nTesting doesn't just show what animals or people are currently positive for the virus, but it can also reveal how spread is unfolding, by what means, and specifics about the virus itself. Understanding the geography of outbreaks can inform when and where isolation strategies like quarantines are applied. With testing and follow-up, close contacts of infected people and animals can be monitored and precautions can be taken to minimize spread. Genetic sequencing performed on virus samples collected through tests can help virologists spot new, potentially dangerous mutations and piece together paths of transmission. Serology testing, which measures antibodies in blood, can show if there are asymptomatic cases proliferating in people and animals.\n\n\"The notion of surveillance is to identify a problem before it is at the scale that we can't control,\" says Piltch-Loeb. With the problem identified, you can offer clearer guidance.\n\nThere are many testing efforts already underway. The USDA has begun mandating testing for lactating dairy cows being transported across state lines. The CDC is continuing to track influenza A cases beyond the regular flu season. And multiple state agencies have voluntary testing programs. Yet these efforts haven't been as successfully implemented everywhere and there are barriers in trust and communication standing in the way.\n\nPandemic prevention needs to be a collaborative effort between government agencies at every level and the stakeholders most directly affected by the spreading virus, says Bhadelia. In most places, dairy farm owners and workers have been slow to start testing for and reporting cases.\n\nUnlike poultry and pig farmers, dairy farmers haven't previously been swept up in an avian influenza scare. Suddenly, their livelihood is potentially at risk. \"They're all confused and anxious about this,\" says Schaffner. Owners don't want to test cows and then be forced to shut down milk production and lose money.\n\nAt the same time, many farm workers-often undocumented and economically vulnerable- are reluctant to report symptoms or undergo testing because they want to avoid government attention and deportation, Gounder notes. Both groups need assurances and incentives to get them on board in the public health effort, she says. In May, the USDA announced a compensation program to help dairy farmers bear the costs of testing their livestock, sampling their milk, sanitizing equipment, and the burden of lost milk production. Ideally, Gounder says there would be a similar federal effort to protect workers-potentially granting them legal status- if they come forward for testing as well.\n\nFiguring out how to boost trust and dialogue with farms is an ongoing process nationwide, but one place is already ahead of the curve. Michigan has been a standout, say both Piltch-Loeb and Bhadelia. Michigan is doing more testing and reporting than any other state (hence why they've detected more cases among both cows and humans than anywhere else-it's not because there's actually more virus there, says Bhadelia).\n\nNatasha Bagdasarian, the state's chief medical executive and an infectious disease physician, credits much of that success so far to transparent communication and a dedication to building proactive and inclusive public health infrastructure. They've expanded their testing lab capacity to seven-day-a-week operations. They've got locally known dairy inspectors reaching out to farmers they've already established relationships with. They've been coordinating across human health, natural resource, labor, veterinary, and agricultural departments with daily meetings. They're working with local health providers and migrant worker outreach organizations. \"From day one, we've taken a very 'one health' response to this-it's the concept that human health, animal health, and environmental health are closely linked.\"\n\nIn Michigan, as with everywhere else, trust in public health entities declined during the Covid-19 pandemic, says Bagdasarian. But the state took that decline seriously and began trying to combat it even before avian influenza materialized in midwest dairy farms, she notes. The state created a public health advisory council that published a report full of recommendations last year. \"Maybe some of that work is paying off,\" she says.\n\nThe state has a serology study planned. Michigan dairy workers receive regular health check-ins via text. The state agricultural agency has required farms to implement biosecurity measures like disinfection of people and vehicles moving between farms and logging farm visitors. Health officials there are also talking with dairy workers to better understand the riskiest aspects of their job and what sorts of personal protective equipment might be best to recommend-PPE should ideally grant safety without compromising someones' ability to work. \"It doesn't make sense for us to put out guidance that isn't practical for people on the ground,\" says Bagdasarian. It's just one of many ways engaging those on the front lines is important.\n\nTesting, PPE, incentives, and information sharing are all important public health measures. But ultimately, the only thing that can stop a virus in its tracks-especially one that is widely circulating in wild animals- is an effective vaccine, says Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\"We need much better vaccines- ones with durability, broad range of prediction, and that are readily available,\" he says. Continually studying flu viruses and funding vaccination development is critical, he adds.\n\nThe Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, part of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, does have a candidate vaccine for H5N1 that's being stored in bulk. The administration announced plans in May to put that vaccine into vials, producing nearly five million doses over the next few months. This is a good step towards preparedness, says Bhadelia, but it comes with complications.\n\nOnce portioned into vials, vaccine doses begin the countdown to expiration, says Schaffner. Vaccines can interfere with our ability to track flu spread, because vaccinated people will have antibodies, despite no history of actual infection, notes Bhadelia. People have to be convinced to take a vaccine. How, where, and when to deploy those doses remains unsettled. And it's unclear how well the candidate vaccine will protect the possible future strains of virus that might mutate to transmit between people, says Osterholm.\n\nConversations about if and how to use vaccines are ongoing in Michigan, says Bagdasarian, and beyond, says Schaffner. Soon, there will be a national case study to look to in Finland. There, the disease hasn't yet appeared in cows, but there have been outbreaks on poultry, mink, and fox farms. The government will soon offer H5N1 vaccines to select groups of people with potential exposure routes like scientists studying the virus, certain farmers, and veterinarians. That test could help improve future vaccination formulas and strategies.\n\nThere is no biological law that says H5N1 will definitely become a pandemic disease that easily passes from person to person. A pivotal mutation emerging would be the product of randomness and opportunity-likely beginning with an unlucky animal or person getting infected with two flu types at once, allowing the viruses to \"reassociate\" and swap genetic material. At multiple points over the past 25 years, Osterholm says flu scientists have warned of an imminent potential avian flu pandemic. In 2012, he notes that biologists said the virus was just one mutation away from that worst-case scenario. So far, that threat hasn't materialized. But there is also no biological law that says it won't. Flu pandemics have occurred throughout human history, and as recently as 2009 with swine flu (H1N1). A future flu pandemic-whether it be from this particular global outbreak or another-could always happen, Osterholm says-which is why preparedness and thinking ahead are so important.\n\nThe CDC maintains that the threat of avian flu to the general public is low for the time being. Dairy workers are currently the people most at risk. But there are still some steps that everyone can take towards public health right now. For starters, people should take extra care in interacting with animals-wild or domestic, says Bhadelia-especially those that seem sick. And everyone should absolutely avoid drinking raw unpasteurized milk, say Bhadelia and Schaffner.\n\nUnpasteurized milk is always a safety risk, but especially so now-when we know that at least one in five milk samples contain H5N1 virus. Cats and mice have gotten sick and died of the avian flu after drinking milk from infected cows. The virus ended up in the cats' brains and lungs, triggering lesions. And it's not just a matter of individual safety. When it comes to opportunities for H5N1 to evolve in humans, every person who decides to drink raw milk is opting to potentially trigger a public health crisis. Little is clear and well-established about H5N1 right now, but over 100 years of scientific evidence supports pasteurization of milk for human health and safety.\n\nBeyond the immediate, an open mind will be important moving forward. Given the number of unknowns, one of the most critical aspects to a successful pandemic risk mitigation effort is flexibility, says Schaffner. \"We're going to learn a lot of new things, we may have to change our minds. That's a very hard thing for the public to grasp.\" Yet still, people will have to keep up. Communication and education efforts will have to improve. Health agencies at every level will have to share information as they learn it. The public will have to have reason to trust that information, even as it shifts.", "source": {"uri": "popsci.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Popular Science"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Even when COVID-19 had started to spread extensively outside China in 2019, I was not as worried as I am now about H5N1.\" -- Dr. Matthew Miller, viral immunologist and director of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster University\n\nThroughout the world, in numerous interviews and articles written in reputable journals, scientists and experts are raising alarm bells about the growing dangers that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1 bird flu) could spill over into the human population and potentially become the next pandemic. Should this transpire, the resulting public health disaster would dwarf that of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed nearly 30 million people and debilitated hundreds of millions with Long COVID globally.\n\nWith a case fatality rate of above 50 percent among humans -- roughly 50 times higher than that of COVID-19 -- it is not hyperbole to state that an H5N1 bird flu pandemic would be apocalyptic. Averting this is of the utmost urgency, and the demand for a global public health program against bird flu must be taken up immediately by the international working class.\n\nH5N1 bird flu was initially discovered in farmed birds in southern China in 1996, with the first recorded case among humans detected the following year. Since then, the virus has been considered one of the most dangerous pathogens with pandemic potential, due to its rapid rate of mutations and high lethality.\n\nSince 2020, coinciding with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, H5N1 has quickly spread among dozens of species, including wild birds and poultry, cats, sea lions, polar bears, and most recently dairy cattle and house mice in the US, with hundreds of millions of animals estimated to have died or been culled globally.\n\nThe spread of the virus to dairy cattle is most concerning to scientists because of their close proximity to farmworkers and the greater inherent dangers of mammal-to-human transmission. So far, there have been three confirmed infections among US farmworkers, with the third raising alarm due to the appearance of respiratory symptoms.\n\nScientists have warned that the essential evolutionary pathway for bird flu to develop into a global pandemic would be the capability of human-to-human airborne transmission, as was the case with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In the worst-case scenario, the virus would develop this capacity, leading to a scene reminiscent of the initial spillover of SARS-CoV-2 at a wet market in Wuhan, China. With an average incubation period of 2-5 days (and up to 17 days), growing numbers of people would unknowingly spread the virus in their community, then globally via air travel, with chains of transmission extending through numerous countries simultaneously. Only this time, the spillover is more likely to take place at a dairy farm in Michigan or Texas than at a wet market in Wuhan.\n\nThe deepening threat of a bird flu pandemic is now concentrated in the United States, where the response of the dairy industry, in collusion with the Biden administration and all responsible federal agencies, has been nothing short of criminal. Sitting on an epidemiological time bomb, they are proceeding with reckless disregard for the health and lives of the US and world population.\n\nOver the past six months, H5N1 has spread rapidly among dairy cattle across the US and is now confirmed to be affecting 94 herds. The first case has been traced to December 2023, with the virus spreading undetected among cattle until late March. Ever since then, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other federal agencies under the Biden administration have bent over backwards to accommodate the dairy industry and ensure their steady flow of profits at the expense of public health.\n\nFar from drawing lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic, an attitude of indifference and cover-up now pervades in official circles. Aside from a single statement by White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre in early May, in which she repeatedly claimed \"the risk is low,\" the White House has said nothing about the growing dangers of bird flu. Reprising its role during the COVID-19 pandemic, the corporate media continuously refers to the \"low risk\" facing the population, when in fact the danger of a bird flu pandemic has never been higher.\n\nMost significantly, the Biden administration has not imposed any requirements on the dairy industry to allow the CDC and other agencies to systematically test, report or track infections among cattle and farmworkers.\n\nTo date, only 239 viral genomic samples have been publicly released by the USDA, despite numerous appeals by scientists for the agency to release data on every infection. The sequences that have been released are from early April at the latest, and therefore do not clarify the evolutionary path of the virus.\n\nRepeating one of the greatest crimes of the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Biden administration and the CDC have conducted the bare minimum of testing, the cornerstone of any public health strategy to prevent pandemics. Only 45 dairy farmworkers or others in contact with infected cattle have received an influenza test, meaning that a growing number of cases are likely going undetected as farmworkers are left defenseless and at the mercy of their corporate bosses.\n\nIn May, the CDC discouraged wastewater surveillance testing for H5N1, when this was offered by leading molecular virologist and wastewater tracker Dr. Marc Johnson.\n\nThe latest USDA epidemiologic brief revealed that 28 percent of all US farms transport their livestock using trucks shared with other farms that are not cleaned prior to use. Perhaps the most basic public health measure of cleaning such facilities was not enforced over the past three months, and there is no indication that the Biden administration intends to change this status quo.\n\nDespite the existence of a bird flu vaccine that is being used on poultry in multiple countries and could be tested among US dairy cattle, this has not been imposed due to the profit imperatives of the dairy industry, as some countries bar imports of products from vaccinated animals.\n\nNeither the Biden administration nor any of the agencies responsible have issued a ban on unpasteurized milk and other dairy products, despite the fact that consumers infected by these products would increase the likelihood of the virus developing the capacity for human-to-human transmission. They have also not mandated the use of ultra-pasteurization, despite a recent study finding that H5N1 can survive normal pasteurization.\n\nSumming up this process, Dr. Rick Bright, an immunologist and COVID-19 whistleblower during the Trump administration, stated, \"We're not stopping it. We're not doing anything to keep that infected milk and infectious milk on the farm. We're not testing these cows before they're put back onto the milking line or sent to slaughter... We're just sort of letting it go and spreading it in a very naive way.\"\n\nMost recently, the USDA revealed that 66 house mice in New Mexico have tested positive for H5N1, which they claim were near a poultry farm but have not substantiated with genomic data. This only raises the dangers of bird flu spreading among humans, as rodents are key vectors for disease, most notoriously rats during the Black Death, which killed off half the population of Europe in the 14th century.\n\nThe response of the American ruling class to the threat of another, even more dangerous pandemic amounts to a collective shrug. For these modern day Malthusians, COVID was a godsend for culling the elderly and infirm, the \"surplus population\" whom they see as an unnecessary drain on their profits. The past four years have seen nothing but bumper profits for the financial elite, as they funneled trillions into their own coffers.\n\nThe whole experience of the COVID-19 pandemic demands urgent action by the international working class to stop the present and growing danger of a new pandemic. Immediate measures must be taken to actually address this unfolding public health crisis, both in the US and internationally. At a minimum, these include:\n\nMass testing of all cattle and farmworkers in the US, combined with rigorous contact tracing and the safe isolation of all infected humans and animalsRank-and-file public health workers must be in control of the CDC, USDA and other federal agencies, to ensure full transparency of all data on H5N1For a vast expansion of public health funding and resources to contain the spread of H5N1, to be paid for through the heavy taxation of US billionaires Workers' control over the dairy industry, to ensure that safety is the guiding principle, not profits\n\nThe fight for these demands can only be developed in opposition to the government, corporations, and media, who are determined to prevent any disruption to the stock market and the flow of profits.\n\nThe anti-scientific response to the growing threat of a bird flu pandemic parallels the relentless attacks on scientists, including researchers centrally involved in the fields of pandemic preparedness and evolutionary biology like Drs. Peter Daszak, Kristian Andersen and Peter Hotez. The scientific community and public health are being crippled at the most critical juncture, as climate change and other factors fuel the threat of future pandemics.\n\nThe collapse of public health and the normalization of mass death from infectious diseases make clear that capitalism has reached a dead-end. It must be replaced through the socialist reorganization of global society.\n\nRead moreScientists and infectious disease experts warn about the growing danger of bird flu13 June 2024Third US farm

(The CDC reports that it is safe to consume pasteurized milk and dairy products.)\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nScientists including McMaster University's Matthew Miller were concerned about avian influenza long before these developments, focusing research on developing a vaccine, but also, Miller says, stopping a public outbreak -- or pandemic -- from happening.\n\nIn the last 20 years, in the relatively rare cases where the H5N1 strain has infected humans, the death rate has been about 50 per cent.\n\n\"Which is staggering,\" he says.\n\nMiller, a viral immunologist, is director of the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Infectious Disease Research at McMaster, and has long researched influenza viruses and how our bodies respond to them.\n\nPrior to arriving in Hamilton, he spent three years at a lab in New York City researching immune responses to influenza and developing a \"universal\" vaccine, a project that continues in the Miller Laboratory he directs at Mac.\n\nHe recently spoke with The Spectator after returning Barcelona, where he attended an infectious disease meeting, and addressing the Canadian Society for Virology general meeting in Saskatoon.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe lives in Hamilton with his wife and two young children.\n\nQuestions and answers have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nJon Wells: You attended Western University for your undergrad. Where are you from?\n\nMatthew Miller: I grew up in Belleville, Ont., and I jokingly tell people that when I was trying to decide on a university, one factor was how far I would need to be away when my parents called to say they were going to show up. So three-and-a-half hours away met the threshold.\n\nQ: Now for the alarmist part of the interview: how concerned are you about the H5N1 bird flu virus?\n\nA: I am anti-alarmist, but I would say that I have never been more worried in my career than I am about H5N1. Even when COVID-19 had started to spread extensively outside China in 2019, I was not as worried as I am now about H5N1.\n\nQ: How come?\n\nA: For one, it's what we know about the severity of H5N1 infections in humans. The death rate, or what we call the case fatality rate, for COVID in aggregate was probably under one per cent, and now in the vaccine era, well under one per cent. The case fatality rate for this (H5N1) virus is a little over 50 per cent. That's more on par with things we usually consider to be really exotic that don't threaten us in North America, like Ebola virus. So that worries me, and also how widespread this virus is in settings that create exposure risk for humans.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nQ: So there is that capacity for spread?\n\nA: The virus is in agricultural settings, and that massively raises the risk relative to most viruses that exist primarily in wildlife reservoirs.\n\nQ: And there is no vaccine for H5N1?\n\nA: Not for this particular strain ... At the (Miller) lab we are working on three primary projects. One is a vaccine. Another is what are often called passive vaccines, which is another way to protect people, with monoclonal antibodies that can act like vaccines for people who don't have healthy immune systems ... And we need to approach pandemic prevention with the same mentality as national security following 9/11: that the event happening at all is unacceptable. It's only by preventing early human infections that we can prevent the virus from having an opportunity to cause a widespread outbreak ... Bio security measures implemented for people who have high occupational exposure risk (to H5N1) are some of the best things we can do.\n\nQ: Why is H5N1 so much more dangerous than COVID-19? What does it do to the body?\n\nA: Great question. Viruses have to get inside the cells of the animals they infect and use the machinery in the cells to replicate. Seasonal flu finds what it needs in our lungs in our upper respiratory tract. And that is good news, because that typically causes less severe infections than lower respiratory infections ... However, bird flu prefers cells in our lower respiratory tract. In addition to that, these viruses have the ability to infect almost all tissues in our bodies including our brains, because they can use machinery that exists outside of our lungs, and that can lead to things like viral encephalitis, which is extraordinarily dangerous and difficult to treat.\n\nQ: Is an H5N1 pandemic a matter of when, not if?\n\nA: There are two sides to the coin. These highly pathogenic H5N1 influenzas have been around since the '90s but this virus still hasn't learned how to transmit well between people and hasn't caused a pandemic. In some ways that is reassuring. But that is balanced by, one, how bad these infections are in humans when they do happen, and two, all of that can change on a dime. If we had done a risk assessment in January of whether there would be a widespread H5N1 infection in cattle, we would have said the risk is extraordinarily low. And the reason is, cattle in commercial operations are often grazing animals roaming in fields, in constant contact with wild birds, and yet we hadn't seen infections in cattle. And then March 2024 rolls around and we hear of an infected dairy cow in Texas, and by the time we look over our shoulder the virus is in cattle basically across the entire country. That's how quickly things can change and that's what gives me pause with this virus in humans; that just because it hasn't happened in 20 years doesn't mean that tomorrow it can't happen. Because every time a virus infects a mammal, and every time a human is exposed, it's like a lottery ticket for the virus to have an opportunity to learn to adapt to spread in humans, and really that's all that is preventing it from causing a widespread outbreak or pandemic.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nQ: Do you know why H5N1 showed up in dairy cattle after all these years?\n\nA: No one really knows; most feel this was just bad luck. The fact that this jump (from birds to cows) appeared to happen only once, and then the spread happened from cow-to-cow, illustrates how unpredictable this virus is.\n\nQ: Do you continue to eat meat and drink milk?\n\nA: I do. I'm probably more of a carnivore than I should be.

According to the Department of Agriculture (USDA), 92 herds in 12 states have confirmed H5N1 cases. And since the USDA does not require cattle ranchers to test their herds for H5N1, researchers do not even have a complete picture of how far H5N1 may have spread among American cattle.\n\n\"The concern about H5N1 has always been there,\" said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at the Brown University School of Public Health. \"But in the last couple of years, [the virus] started doing things that have been a bit unusual.\"\n\n\"We've seen this virus start to infect mammals and a wide range of mammals,\" she said, pointing at the different outbreaks throughout the world. \"That's a concern because humans are mammals, and so mammals are more like us than birds are.\"\n\nBut what makes this recent outbreak the most concerning for Nuzzo is that the virus is now capable of infecting cows. \"Cows are mammals that humans have a lot more contact with than all the other mammals that we've seen get infected,\" she said.\n\nH5N1 has not yet evolved to efficiently spread between humans, researchers told KQED.\n\nAt the moment, the three confirmed cases among humans were most likely caused by these individuals interacting directly with a sick cow. All three infected humans worked with dairy cows in states with confirmed H5N1 cases among cattle.\n\nBut if the virus can jump from cow to human, it still needs to evolve a lot more for it to move from human to human. \"Certain mutations are necessary for that to happen,\" said Dr. Abraar Karan, who studies infectious diseases at Stanford University. Some of those mutations would allow for \"the virus remains stable in the air and that it becomes more efficient at infecting certain types of receptors in human lungs.\"\n\nThe CDC reports that the close contacts of those dairy workers who tested positive for H5N1 have not themselves developed symptoms.\n\nHowever, because cattle ranchers aren't required to test their herds for H5N1, researchers still don't know how many cows have been exposed to the virus -- and consequently, how many humans could now be interacting with infected cattle.\n\n\"We haven't really contained the virus within dairy cows yet,\" Chin-Hong said. \"And the more it continues in the dairy cows, the more it's going to probably result in contact with dairy workers.\"\n\n\"The more transmission events there are, the more chances the virus will have to mutate and suddenly, by accident, be able to enter the bodies of humans more effectively.\"\n\nEven before the first confirmed human case of H5N1 back in April, the research community pushed federal officials to prioritize the H5N1 outbreak among cattle, specifically to make testing more accessible. On May 30, the USDA announced that it would transfer $824 million from other existing initiatives in order to launch the Voluntary H5N1 Dairy Herd Status Pilot Program.\n\nThe CDC continues to monitor the three individuals infected with H5N1 in 2024. The first case, a dairy worker in Texas reported eye redness as their only symptom and, according to health officials, is recovering.\n\nThe second person infected with bird flu also experienced pink eye, but the third case reported new symptoms: a sore throat and a cough.", "source": {"uri": "kqed.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KQED"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University School of Public Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sea lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erythema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sore throat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Receptor (biochemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Animals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/06/CaliforniaCattle082311-1020x656.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 3030, "textEnd": 3036}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The districts of Alappuzha, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta in Kerala, where water bodies, migratory birds, fowls and integrated farms form part of the ecosystem, have reported H5N1 outbreaks in 19 places since April. However, the death of crows in large numbers in Alappuzha, and subsequent confirmation of the H5N1 virus in their carcasses have given rise to concerns that the virus could spread far and wide.\n\nHow dangerous is it?\n\nEver since it emerged in 1996, H5N1 has resulted in the mass killing of billions of wild birds as well as fowls. The virus's jump to some 26 mammalian species, especially cattle and the now emerging proof that it can infect humans, has heightened the threat perception that H5N1 could lead to the next global pandemic. Of particular concern are the facts that herd-to-herd transmission of H5N1 is now taking place in the U.S., involving some 12 States and that the virus has been detected in raw milk and in milking machines.\n\nHuman cases of bird flu 'an enormous concern': WHO\n\nAccording to scientists, the virus lacks changes that would make it better adapted to transmit between people and therefore, the risk to human health remains low. However, the potential for influenza viruses to rapidly evolve and the wide geographic spread of H5N1 signals that more human infections should be expected.\n\nWhat is the level of risk to humans?\n\nThe virus seems to spread from birds/animals to humans who may be closely interacting with these, without adequate personal protection.\n\nWHO confirms human case of bird flu in India; four-year-old infected in West Bengal\n\nAccording to the WHO, between 2003 and April 1, 2024, close to 900 human infections of H5N1 have been reported from 23 countries, of which, more than half were fatal. Even though the risk of human infections from H5N1 is still perceived to be low, this can change rapidly as the virus spreads to more animals, especially cows or domestic mice, which have closer contact with humans. In districts like Alappuzha where water fowls, chicken, dairy cows and humans share the same environment, the opportunities for human infections should be perceived as high.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of H5N1?\n\nThe common symptoms of H5N1 are similar to those of influenza-A illnesses, including respiratory difficulties, fever, cough, sore throat and pneumonia, all of which can potentially worsen, especially in those who are immunocompromised or have underlying conditions. In the U.S., conjuctivitis or pink eye was the only symptom that was reported in one of the farm workers who was infected.\n\nDoes India need to be concerned about the avian flu outbreak? | In Focus podcast\n\nIn April itself, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had sent out a health advisory that clinicians should consider the possibility of H5N1 infection in persons who report with respiratory illness or conjunctivitis, if they have had exposure to livestock or dead birds. Early detection and containment of the infection is important to prevent the extensive spread of the virus.\n\nAs of now, in Kerala, as only the poultry has been found affected in all outbreaks, the strategy adopted for containment is the mass culling of birds within a certain radius of the reported infection. However, the incident of the mass death of crows has now changed the equation, as it is possible that the infection may have been taken by the crows beyond the current surveillance zone. Continuous surveillance by testing environmental samples -- water, faecal matter of birds -- as well as Influenza-like illness human samples would be necessary in designated surveillance zones. People who have livestock and birds at home are being advised to wear masks, and the antiviral Tamiflu is being prescribed as prophylaxis to people wherever H5N1 positive cases are found.\n\nWhat are the necessary precautions?\n\nPeople should avoid unprotected exposure to infected birds or animals or their contaminated environments. If at all one has been exposed to a possible H5N1-contaminated environment, they should monitor themselves for new respiratory illness symptoms, including conjunctivitis for 10 days and seek proper medical advice. It would be better to ensure that people use only pasteurised milk and poultry meat and eggs should be well-cooked to prevent any possible food-borne transmission of H5N1.\n\nDoes bird flu have the potential to turn into the next pandemic?\n\nIn a recent editorial, The Lancet, spoke about the need for a robust and coordinated response to H5N1. It pointed out that the concept of 'One Health', although often acknowledged, is rarely prioritised and operationalised.\n\nKerala, however, has taken 'One Health' beyond the conceptual framework and the project is currently being implemented as part of the World Bank-aided 'Rebuild Kerala' project in four districts -- Alappuzha, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, and Idukki. It has established a community-based disease surveillance network, with 2.5 lakh volunteers trained in the 'One Health' concept in these districts, who will report any unusual events or death of animals/birds in a locality so that early warning and early preventive or control measures can be taken.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"},

Nearly 97m domesticated birds in the US have been affected by the highly pathogenic influenza since 2022.\n\nAlthough officials believe this outbreak was originally sparked by a single introduction from migratory birds into cows - for instance, via feed contaminated by bird feces - late last year, genomic analyses now suggest it is being spread between animals and farms by human activity, according a report released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Thursday.\n\nThe report, which focused on cases in Michigan, found that transmission is likely happening when workers, cows, vehicles and equipment go to multiple farms.\n\nAmong employees at dairies with outbreaks, one in five employees work at other dairies and 7% work on poultry operations as well. That's in addition to the veterinarians, nutritionists and haulers who regularly visit multiple farms.\n\nThree in five Michigan dairies with outbreaks use shared vehicles to transport cows, but only 12% clean the vehicles first. All but one of the affected dairies belong to the same milk co-ops.\n\nThe results are in line with a second report also released by the USDA on Thursday, showing that about one-third of employees at US dairies with outbreaks also work on other farms with livestock - usually dairy farms, but sometimes swine and poultry.\n\nMore than half of affected dairy farms across the US share trucks and trailers to transport cows, and more than half of those who share vehicles don't clean them first, the report said.\n\n\"Biosecurity is the key to prevention,\" Kammy Johnson, a veterinary epidemiologist with the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told reporters on Thursday. That means decontaminating everything that goes from farm to farm - transportation, clothing, equipment - and reducing the chances of infected animals, or people, passing the virus onward.\n\nIt's not clear if the outbreak is continuing to gain force, officials said, but they expect to find more cases in cows.\n\nAnd, as the virus evolves, it could become more of a threat to people, according to a recent report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Officials expect to see more bird flu cases among humans as the outbreak continues, the report said.\n\n\"The more infections there are among cows, the more risk there is for infections to occur among humans,\" Dr Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\"The fact that it's in 20% of our milk supply should be disturbing to everyone because that means it's gone around already,\" Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said last week. \"If it starts to jump, that's when we really have to worry.\"\n\nYet testing has lagged, in a situation reminiscent of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe only authorized test for H5N1 among humans comes from the CDC, and it is only available to people who have symptoms and a history of close contact with infected animals or other people. So far, there have only been 45 tests performed this year.\n\nYet there have been reports of workers with positive flu A tests that are not sequenced for H5N1, as well as potential missed cases, like the farm workers and a local maternity worker who reported flu-like symptoms near the first confirmed human case this year in Texas.\n\nProviders may now be reluctant to test for influenza even if a patient has respiratory symptoms, since the flu season has ended and thus insurance companies may not pay for the tests.\n\nThe USDA requires lactating dairy cows to be tested before moving across state borders. The federal government does not have the authority to require testing of animals or people on a wide scale, which means these efforts largely fall to state and local entities.\n\nIn Wisconsin, for instance, which has not yet announced any infections in cows, farmers are now required to test cows before taking them to fairs and exhibits.\n\nCows have died in at least five states - South Dakota, Michigan, Colorado, Ohio and Texas - because they didn't recover or developed secondary infections after testing positive for H5N1. The majority of infected cows recover, but these deaths indicate the potential financial burden of an uncontrolled outbreak.\n\nBarn cats and mice have also tested positive for H1N1, raising concerns the animals could spread the virus in communities beyond the farms.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Located in northern Michigan's Antrim County, she has worked there for almost 50 years now.\n\nThe farm day starts early.\n\n\"We're out here at 5 o'clock every morning to get started feeding the babies,\" she said.\n\nBut there are some additional chores for farmers in Michigan, now that avian influenza, or bird flu, has made the jump to cattle.\n\nNew state requirements include limiting the number of visitors and increasing disinfection practices like cleaning boots and vehicles. Michigan also has prohibited poultry or lactating cows from being shown at events like fairs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has required that lactating cows moving across state lines receive a negative test result on bird flu.\n\n\"We are conscious that the threat is there, and we wouldn't let just anybody come in,\" Stanek said, referring to the state requirement to limit visitors.\n\nWith outbreaks of bird flu in dairy cattle across the country, health officials are emphasizing biosecurity -- that is, efforts to prevent the introduction and spread of disease.\n\nResearchers are still working to understand how climate change is affecting the spread of the bird flu. But, as Grist has previously reported, H5N1 has spread outside its typical seasons as migratory patterns have changed. And research has shown that generally, climate change could join a host of other factors in making the transmission of viruses between species more likely -- something called \"viral spillover.\"\n\n\"We are in a place where the threat of emerging pathogens is much greater than ever before. So therefore, the need for biosecurity is even more significant than it has ever been before,\" said Suresh Kuchipudi, a professor and chair of the infectious diseases and microbiology department at the University of Pittsburgh's School of Public Health.\n\nSome, like Kuchipudi, say scaling up biosecurity operations can help the agricultural sector become more resilient to climate change. But it's just one part of the complicated process of responding to the spread of viruses like the bird flu.\n\nThis strain of avian influenza is called H5N1, and it's highly pathogenic, meaning it's deadly for poultry. First detected in the 1990s, it has surged over the last several years, spreading to birds and mammals across the world.\n\nThe spread to cattle is new.\n\n\"I'm a virologist by training, and my other virologist buddies and I all have to admit: None of us saw this coming,\" said Kim Dodd, the director of the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Michigan State University. Animals like foxes can contract the flu when they eat an infected carcass. But cattle don't eat meat.\n\n\"We didn't expect to find [highly pathogenic] avian influenza in dairy cattle, and to find that it amplifies so well, and that we have so much virus in the milk,\" Dodd said. \"And so that's really a big part of trying to understand, you know, what do we do about that to be able to help control the outbreak.\"\n\nThe first confirmed case in cattle was reported in Texas earlier this year, and 11 more states have confirmed cases of the bird flu in dairy herds.\n\nMichigan has reported the most cases in the country. As of Wednesday, the state had confirmed 25 instances of the flu in herds. It also has 2 of the 3 confirmed cases of the disease in people -- the other was a dairy worker in Texas.\n\nIn May, state officials declared the flu an \"extraordinary emergency,\" calling it a threat to animal health, human health, trade and the economy.\n\nOfficials and researchers have said Michigan's high case count is an example of robust testing in response to the outbreak. Overall, the response to the bird flu outbreak in cattle has been somewhat rocky. States have pushed back against federal efforts to address the virus, and public health experts have raised concerns about the lack of testing and warned that the true reach is likely greater that official counts.\n\nThose involved in Michigan's response have said part of its response is collaboration with farmers. \"That takes two sides,\" said Dodd. \"It takes the people who are looking and the people who are testing, but it also requires that the people who own the animals are opening their doors and allowing testing to occur.\"\n\nH5N1 causes a reduction in cows' milk production, among other symptoms. It can devastate the poultry industry; since it was detected in commercial flocks in the United States in 2022, it has led to the deaths of close to 100 million farmed birds.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have maintained that the danger to the public is relatively low. But dairy workers are now more at risk of exposure to the bird flu as they work with cows; the virus appears to be spreading largely through milk.\n\n\"We want to make sure that we're limiting the further spread of the virus, so that we're continuing to protect human health, and we don't have so much virus in the environment that could potentially mutate and affect humans in a different way,\" said Tim Boring, the director of the state Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.\n\nOne of the ways the state is doing that is by urging farms to follow biosecurity measures. These are pretty low tech -- like wearing protective gear and disinfecting equipment. How effective they are comes down to compliance.\n\n\"I'm sure they're serious. I'm sure they're not fooling around. It's their livelihood, their investments,\" said Jean-Pierre Vaillancourt, a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Montreal. But \"if they're not sharing data, and they're not doing good surveillance to figure out who's where and what and all that, we already have a big problem.\"\n\nClimate change coincides with the spread of certain diseases, as animals interact with one another in new settings. While biosecurity may play a role in prevention or response, it likely won't stop the next pandemic, Vaillancourt said. He argues that we should actually be looking at disease from a regional perspective.\n\n\"What can we do to minimize the spread between sites?\" he said. \"That requires data sharing.\"\n\nThat's where industry and institutions often fall short. Farms that have outbreaks can face stigma and lose money, and farm workers that test positive can deal with health and economic issues. Worker advocacy groups have also voiced concerns that testing isn't reaching those on the front lines.\n\nSome public health experts say the surge of bird flu in cattle is an opportunity to hone that response and protect animal and human life in the process.\n\n\"The fact is, [governments] need to learn how to get this right when the stakes are lower, because there are less forgiving bird flu viruses than this one,\" said Amesh Adalja, a scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nThe agricultural industry will have to be part of any response to infectious diseases as the climate changes. Humans often interact with animals in agricultural settings. Preventing and responding to viruses also requires establishing trust with farmers.\n\n\"This is going to be part of how you think about building resilience, is that you kind of have this integrated approach,\" Adalja said.\n\nThat approach is known as One Health, which many involved in public health have pointed to as a framework that acknowledges the connection between people, animals and the environment and seeks to address issues like disease in a holistic way.\n\nWildlife surveillance systems and vaccine programs can help track and control viruses like the bird flu.\n\nAnd the dairy industry can learn something from those working with pigs, Vaillancourt said. An effort called the Morrison Swine Health Monitoring Project has involved farmers and the industry in keeping track of disease in pigs.\n\nThe big picture, he said, is that everyone involved in livestock needs to think about stopping the spread of disease. Say a farmer needs to move some cows.\n\n\"How do we move them?\" he said. \"Which roads are we going to use to minimize contaminating a site on our way. How do we clean and disinfect the vehicles when we go from one site to another site?\"\n\nA few efforts have been pushed forward as the virus has spread. The federal government announced that it would spend $824 million in emergency funding on its response, and the USDA just launched a voluntary pilot program to test cow milk in bulk.\n\nAnd agricultural officials in Michigan say more safety measures on farms could become a bigger part of the state's approach to climate change.\n\n\"Improving biosecurity in new ways that we hadn't previously considered, I think, will increasingly be a component of robust climate resiliency actions,\" said Boring, the director of the state agriculture department. \"So we're seeing a little bit of that in real time here with our response to H5N1 here in the state.\"\n\nAnd back in Antrim County, Laurie Stanek said dealing with animal sickness is just part of running a farm; they're paying attention to the new rules and doing what they've always done.\n\n\"A lot of it's just good herdsmanship -- just common sense,\" she said. \"You keep your animals healthy so they in turn give you a healthy product.\"\n\nThat, she said, is what their livelihood depends on.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Grist at https://grist.org/health/in-michigan-climate-change-bird-flu-and-dairy-cows-and-why-none-of-us-saw-this-coming/.\n\nGrist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

That means decontaminating everything that goes from farm to farm - transportation, clothing, equipment - and reducing the chances of infected animals, or people, passing the virus onward.\n\nIt's not clear if the outbreak is continuing to gain force, officials said, but they expect to find more cases in cows.\n\nAnd, as the virus evolves, it could become more of a threat to people, according to a recent report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Officials expect to see more bird flu cases among humans as the outbreak continues, the report said.\n\n\"The more infections there are among cows, the more risk there is for infections to occur among humans,\" Dr Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\"The fact that it's in 20% of our milk supply should be disturbing to everyone because that means it's gone around already,\" Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said last week. \"If it starts to jump, that's when we really have to worry.\"\n\nYet testing has lagged, in a situation reminiscent of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe only authorized test for H5N1 among humans comes from the CDC, and it is only available to people who have symptoms and a history of close contact with infected animals or other people. So far, there have only been 45 tests performed this year.\n\nYet there have been reports of workers with positive flu A tests that are not sequenced for H5N1, as well as potential missed cases, like the farm workers and a local maternity worker who reported flu-like symptoms near the first confirmed human case this year in Texas.\n\nProviders may now be reluctant to test for influenza even if a patient has respiratory symptoms, since the flu season has ended and thus insurance companies may not pay for the tests.\n\nThe USDA requires lactating dairy cows to be tested before moving across state borders. The federal government does not have the authority to require testing of animals or people on a wide scale, which means these efforts largely fall to state and local entities.\n\nIn Wisconsin, for instance, which has not yet announced any infections in cows, farmers are now required to test cows before taking them to fairs and exhibits.\n\nCows have died in at least five states - South Dakota, Michigan, Colorado, Ohio and Texas - because they didn't recover or developed secondary infections after testing positive for H5N1. The majority of infected cows recover, but these deaths indicate the potential financial burden of an uncontrolled outbreak.\n\nBarn cats and mice have also tested positive for H1N1, raising concerns the animals could spread the virus in communities beyond the farms.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Since then, the agency has recorded cases in over one hundred herds across twelve states, as well as three human cases in Texas and Michigan.\n\nMan in Mexico died of a bird flu strain that hadn't been confirmed before in a human, WHO says\n\nBut Connecticut public health officials and infectious disease physicians say that the current risk of bird flu to the general public remains low.\n\nThe chicken and egg problem of fighting another flu pandemic\n\n\"The good news is the human cases are exceedingly low, and they're all so far from people that have had direct contact with lactating cows,\" said Manisha Juthani, commissioner of the Department of Public Health. \"For a regular resident in the state of Connecticut, the risk is low.\"\n\nScott Roberts, the associate director of infection prevention at Yale New Haven Health, said that the risk to humans through the consumption of animal products is also low.\n\n\"There's no evidence that live virus is reaching consumers through eggs or milk, and pasteurization kills the virus. Cooking foods such as chicken and eggs kills the virus,\" said Roberts, an expert on diseases like COVID-19 and flu.\n\nThe risk is slightly higher for farm workers, Juthani explained, but Connecticut is not currently one of the twelve states with an identified case in dairy cows.\n\nBryan Hurlburt, the commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Agriculture, said in a written statement that the department has been working to protect the state's livestock industry from an outbreak by monitoring lactating cows and working with DPH to distribute personal protective equipment to farmworkers and processors.\n\n\"The emergence of H5N1 is an opportunity to remind everyone -- urban, suburban, rural -- that animal health, environmental health, human health, and food accessibility/safety are all spokes of the One Health wheel,\" wrote Hurlburt.\n\nWhile the short-term risk is low, Roberts said that two aspects of the virus concern him in the long-term: its mortality rate and its ability to jump from species to species.\n\n\"When it does reach humans, it's very severe,\" said Roberts. \"Of the 900 or so cases that have been reported since this was first discovered in the late '90s, about half of them, or 50%, have died.\"\n\nBut so far in this outbreak, both humans and dairy cows have experienced only mild symptoms, said Juthani. In the three human cases, two people experienced conjunctivitis, or pink eye, and the third had symptoms of a mild upper respiratory infection. In cows, the primary symptom has been lower milk production for those that are lactating.\n\nRoberts also worries that the current strain of the virus started out in wild birds but has since infected several species, including foxes, house mice, bears and domestic cats.\n\nUS pledges money and other aid to help track and contain bird flu on dairy farms\n\n\"Clearly, this virus is evolving and learning how to jump across species. And so I think the natural question one has to ask is, 'How long until it evolves and adapts to the point where it can infect humans?' And the answer to that question might be 'never,'\" said Roberts.\n\nJuthani said human and animal interactions have always concerned her, and not just when it comes to the bird flu. As a former practicing infectious disease physician, she advised patients to use caution, for example, when interacting with farm or exotic animals while traveling.\n\n\"If you look at traditionally where any of these more concerning viruses or bacteria have emerged from, it is from those types of interactions,\" said Juthani. \"In general, my advice would be that if you are concerned, then I would try to minimize those types of interactions.\"\n\nDPH is partnering with other state and federal agencies to monitor the evolution of the virus.\n\n\"There has been very good communication in terms of what information there is federally and what we have here locally,\" said Juthani.\n\nThe department checks in weekly with the CDC and also stays in close contact with the Food and Drug Administration, Juthani said. DPH is also following the lead of the state's Department of Agriculture, since the current outbreak is primarily in animals.\n\nAgencies at the federal and state level are also using data to check for signs of an outbreak in humans.\n\nCT ag department issues flock biosecurity recommendations on avian 'flu' amid spring migration\n\nThe CDC tracks wastewater data for influenza outbreaks and is watching for signs of an uptick in cases that would be unexpected for this time of year. DPH monitors symptoms for every patient that goes into ERs across the state and has been watching for upticks in symptoms related to this strain of the bird flu, like pink eye and upper respiratory issues.\n\n\"I want people in Connecticut to know that we are collaborating regularly so that we can be knowledgeable and be as best prepared to help people make informed choices as things potentially could evolve. And they might not, but if they do that's what our job is -- is to be prepared,\" said Juthani.", "source": {"uri": "courant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hartfort Courant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katy_golvala@courant.com", "name": "Katy Golvala", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Haven, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Haven, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_respiratory_tract_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Upper respiratory tract infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.courant.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bird_Flu_42303.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Image: Pixabay\n\nPet cats could be a significant vector of infection in a human avian flu pandemic, according to a review of two decades of research data.\n\nThe study, currently a preprint awaiting peer review, suggests that cat owners should be vigilant for signs of illness in their pets. This illness could also put themselves, their vets, and any other close contacts at risk.\n\nThe highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus currently affecting cattle on US dairy farms has already proven itself quite capable of infecting a wide range of mammal species - around 27 at the last count, according to former CDC director Robert Redfield. But while infections in dolphins and polar bears are certainly of scientific interest, it's the animals that share our homes that are raising the biggest concerns for epidemiologists.\n\nThis year in the US, three farm workers contracted the virus after coming into contact with infected cattle. As well as jumping from birds to cows, the disease has found its way into other farm animals - some unfortunate alpacas in Idaho, and farm cats thought to have succumbed after consuming raw milk.\n\nWhile you might not necessarily think to put \"bird flu\" and \"alpacas\" in the same sentence, scientists have long been aware that cats are susceptible to avian flu. But what is the risk for our beloved pets, and for us as owners? Researchers at the University of Maryland combed through 20 years of published data on the spread of bird flu in feline species to try and find out.\n\nMapping the period between 2004 and 2024, the scientists noticed a sharp increase in reports of infections in domestic felines - rather than wild or zoo-kept cats - starting in 2023. The spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 coincides with this rise in domestic cat infections, as the virus infects a number of species never previously impacted by bird flu. Infections have also been reported in house mice, a favoured prey item of domestic cats everywhere, and we all know how much free-roaming cats enjoy chasing birds.\n\nThe Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that it is unlikely for humans to catch bird flu from cats, but it is possible, \"especially if there is prolonged and unprotected exposure to the animal.\" Veterinarians, veterinary nurses, and other professionals who work closely with potentially infected animals may therefore also be at risk, and the CDC issues guidance about the best use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in these cases.\n\nFor pet owners, the study's lead author, Professor Kristen Coleman, who researches airborne infectious diseases, had some suggestions for how to help keep your kitty safe. \"Don't feed your cat raw meat or unpasteurised milk, and limit their unsupervised time outdoors,\" the author said in a statement. \"Cats prey on wild birds that could be infected, and they could get into raw milk on a farm if it is not securely stored.\"\n\nThere have also been a handful of reports of feline-to-feline transmission of avian flu. Scientists are very concerned about the possibility of a human pandemic. The more the virus adapts to mammalian immune systems, the greater the chance it could become established in the human population.\n\nWhen cats become ill with bird flu, they often show difficulty breathing or behavioural changes, so be on the lookout for these signs and seek veterinary advice promptly. Researchers have also reported that H5N1 can cause blindness in some cats.\n\nAccording to Coleman, the current H5N1 strain is deadly for cats, with a mortality rate of around 67% -- all the more reason to keep Felix and Fluffy indoors as much as possible.\n\n\"The virus is going to find its way into more places, just like it did in dairy farms,\" she said.

The current bird flu outbreak is causing mounting casualties in cats.\n\nOver the past few months, a bird flu outbreak has spread swiftly through dairy cows in the United States, infecting more than 90 herds in 12 states. Along the way, the virus has caused collateral damage in several other species, spreading from dairies to poultry farms and from cows into at least three farmworkers, who developed symptoms of mild illness.\n\nIt has also caused mounting casualties in cats. On some dairy farms, sick or dead cats have provided an early signal that something was amiss. \"They're a bit of a canary in a coal mine,\" Dr. Kammy Johnson, a veterinary epidemiologist for the Agriculture Department, said at a news briefing Thursday.\n\nSince the dairy outbreak was first detected in late March, at least 21 cats in nine states have caught the virus, according to the department, which recently began tracking the feline cases.\n\nScientists have long known that cats are vulnerable to being infected by avian influenza, a group of flu viruses typically found in birds. In 2020, a new version of a bird flu virus, known as H5N1, emerged. It has spread rapidly around the world, infecting many wild birds and repeatedly spilling over into mammals, including cats.\n\n\"Domestic cats are actually highly susceptible to avian influenza, and especially H5N1,\" said Kristen Coleman, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Maryland. \"But there has been a recent uptick in domestic cat infections, a drastic uptick.\"\n\nThere have been sporadic reports of infected dogs, too.\n\nWhile bird flu infections of pets remain rare overall, they can be severe, especially in cats. \"It results in very severe illness and oftentimes death,\" Coleman said. \"So it's very serious, and it should be taken seriously.\"\n\nBut a few \"reasonable precautions\" can help people keep their pets safe, she said.\n\nOn dairy farms, cats were infected after drinking unpasteurized milk, also known as raw milk, which contains very high levels of the virus, from sick cows. More than 80% of affected dairy farms had cats on their premises, and more than half of those farms reported sick or dead cats, according to federal data released Thursday.\n\nBut even before the recent dairy outbreak, there were reports of infected cats, some of which probably caught the virus when they preyed upon infected birds. \"As we get more dead, wild birds on the landscape, if we get more dead poultry on the landscape, these carnivores that may get into them and ingest them, even after they're dead, are getting just a massive dose of virus,\" said Dr. Justin Brown, a wildlife veterinarian at Penn State.\n\nA few larger outbreaks have also been linked to contaminated raw poultry. In 2023, for instance, bird flu outbreaks hit two cat shelters in Seoul, South Korea. Government investigators there subsequently found the virus in raw duck meat fed to the cats.\n\nHow does bird flu affect cats?\n\nCats infected by the virus often become severely ill, and in some instances, the mortality rate has been \"shockingly high,\" said Dr. Younjung Kim, a veterinary epidemiologist at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research. At one affected cat shelter in South Korea, he noted, 38 of 40 cats died.\n\nIn a recent review, which has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, Coleman found that the new version of H5N1 had a 67% mortality rate in felines. (That calculation is primarily based on domestic cats, although it includes a handful of cases in other species, such as bobcats and lynx.)\n\nMany infected cats develop fevers, loss of appetite and respiratory symptoms, which may include nasal discharge, difficulty breathing and pneumonia. Neurological symptoms, including stiffness, tremors and seizures, are common, too. \"Sometimes this is confused for rabies,\" Coleman said.\n\nInfections in cats can also be asymptomatic, although it remains unclear how common that is, since mild or asymptomatic cases may escape detection.\n\nAre cats spreading the virus to people or other animals?\n\nIt's unclear. \"We do not fully understand whether or not they are capable of transmitting,\" Johnson said. There is not yet any evidence that cats have been contributing to the spread of the virus on dairy farms, she added.\n\nIn the case of the outbreaks at the Korean cat shelters, scientists aren't sure whether all of the sick cats contracted the virus from contaminated food or whether some of the animals caught the virus from each other.\n\n\"It was a very good opportunity to study cat-to-cat transmission,\" said Kim, who published a paper on the outbreaks. But by the time the virus was detected, many of the dead cats had already been disposed of, he said, making the epidemiological investigation difficult. \"So we don't know the extent of the viral transmission,\" he said.\n\nHowever, previous studies have shown that cats can spread some bird flu viruses to each other and to people. In 2004, a laboratory study revealed that cats infected with an earlier version of H5N1 were capable of shedding the virus and infecting other cats.\n\nAnd in 2016, a different bird flu virus, known as H7N2, tore through the cats at a New York City animal shelter. At least two people -- a veterinarian and a shelter worker -- also became infected, investigators found. Both people had mild symptoms and recovered.\n\nAre dogs at risk, too?\n\nYes. There have been a handful of cases, including serious ones, reported in dogs.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, a dog in Ottawa, Ontario, was infected with H5N1 and died \"after chewing on a wild goose,\" according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. That same year, an infected dog in Poland developed a severe cough and other symptoms but recovered.\n\nOverall, however, dogs seem to be less susceptible to the virus than cats are and appear less likely to develop severe disease.\n\nFor a recent study, Brown and his colleagues analyzed blood samples from nearly 200 hunting dogs in Washington. The researchers looked for antibodies to the virus, which would indicate that the dogs had previously been infected by it.\n\n\"And we looked specifically at waterfowl hunting dogs because they are going to be the ones that are actively in infected habitats and retrieving infected birds in their mouth,\" Brown said. \"We figured that was about as high a risk group as you could get.\"\n\nJust four of the dogs had antibodies; none had developed any symptoms or passed the virus on to other dogs in their households, the researchers found. The results suggest that the virus is not well adapted to dogs, which may require very high doses of virus in order to become infected, Brown said.\n\nStill, Brown cautioned, the virus can change quickly, and it could become a bigger threat to dogs in the future. \"I think we always have to be ready for that change to occur,\" he said.\n\nHow can I protect my pet from bird flu?\n\nPets that remain indoors should be at exceedingly low risk, experts said. But owners should avoid feeding their pets raw milk or raw meat, which both could potentially transmit the virus.\n\nOf course, an entirely indoor lifestyle is not possible for many pets. \"We're not asking you to lock your pet up,\" Coleman said. So owners should take common-sense safety measures with outdoor pets, including to try to keep them away from sick or dead birds and from places where wild waterfowl congregate, experts said. Removing shared food and water sources, such as bird feeders and baths, may also help curb the spread of the virus.\n\nPaying attention to the local situation can help, too; owners may want to keep their pets indoors more, or supervise them more closely, if bird flu outbreaks have recently been reported in their area.\n\nAs always, pet owners should monitor their animals for signs of illness, especially if their pets have had recent exposure to sick or dead birds, and consult a veterinarian if they have concerns.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

This latest case, involving a dairy worker in Michigan, raises concerns due to the individual exhibiting respiratory symptoms, highlighting the pandemic potential of this virus. U.S. hospitals need to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.\n\nThe three human cases of H5N1 in the U.S. -- the first one in Texas and the others in Michigan -- are not connected to each other. Fortunately, all three individuals experienced mild symptoms and have fully recovered, with no additional cases detected. These infections are part of a broader epidemic affecting dairy cattle, with more than 90 herds infected across 12 states. Wastewater surveillance has shown increased detections of influenza A in certain areas. Bird flu is in the family of influenza A so any increase observed can be implicated with H5N1 or other influenza A viruses, such as H1N1 and H3N2 that routinely circulate in people. While there is yet no evidence of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 virus, this could emerge at any time, underscoring the urgent need for hospitals to bolster their preparedness for potential additional human cases of H5N1.\n\nThe current risk to the general public is low, though individuals with job-related or recreational exposure to infected birds, cattle, or other animals are at higher risk for infection. To date, no severe illness or deaths from H5N1 have been reported in the U.S., though the virus is known to be deadly. Since the first human outbreak in 1997 in Hong Kong, more than 900 sporadic cases have been reported in 23 countries, with more than half resulting in death.\n\nAs leaders in health care and public health, we recognize the important role hospitals play in outbreak detection and response, and mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. With H5N1 posing a potentially significant public health threat, hospitals must adopt proactive, comprehensive strategies to prepare for, reduce the threat of, and respond to potential cases. Here are four strategies we recommend hospitals implement:\n\nTesting is the first step in detecting and managing people with H5N1 bird flu. Clinicians should consider testing people showing signs or symptoms of acute respiratory illness or conjunctivitis with relevant exposure history, especially anyone who has had contact with potentially infected sick or dead birds, livestock, or other animals within 10 days of the onset of symptoms. Clinical presentations can range from mild conjunctivitis and upper respiratory symptoms to severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure.\n\nIt is crucial for clinicians to understand that cases of H5N1 bird flu can occur without any known links to infected animals, animal products, or contaminated sources (such as equipment), so it's important to test individuals who exhibit H5N1 symptoms, regardless of their exposure history.\n\nPublic health authorities, who control whether testing for H5N1 should be conducted at a public health laboratory, should be flexible and allow clinicians to test patients for H5N1 based on their own clinical judgement and who may not fit the specific criteria for H5N1 -- like being in direct contact with an infected animal -- as the risk for being infected with H5N1 is evolving.\n\nThrough the national and state Influenza Surveillance Report currently in place, hospitals, clinics, and community providers are essential for public health surveillance for seasonal influenza, including detecting novel strains like H5N1. Identifying various viral subtypes is typically done in public health laboratories. As such, effective communication and coordination between clinicians and local health departments are crucial for diagnosing and managing human H5N1 cases.\n\nIncreased awareness of H5N1 among clinicians is important for recognizing potential infections in humans and initiating public health investigations. For individuals directly exposed to dairy cows, birds, or other animals that can carry H5N1, or those in at-risk groups, clinicians should be thinking H5N1 if there are signs, symptoms, and a positive influenza A test and immediately contact their local public health departments for subtyping.\n\nAll hospitals have the ability to test for influenza A, since this family of viruses includes the normally circulating flu strains they see every flu season. Individuals who do not have obvious exposure to H5N1 but have flu strains that are not H1N1 or H3N2, the typical seasonal flu strains, should be evaluated for H5N1 at public health laboratories. Testing for other causes of acute respiratory illness, including SARS-CoV-2, should also be considered based on local epidemiology of circulating respiratory viruses.\n\nHealth care workers are the frontline defenders in responding to outbreaks, acting as public health eyes and ears in the fight against infectious diseases. Their preparedness is vital for public health. To ensure effective monitoring and response to potential H5N1 cases, all clinicians must be educated on CDC guidelines for identifying infections, initiating antiviral treatment, and notifying health departments for testing. Training should cover H5N1 criteria and definition of risk factors for infection with H5N1, proper notification procedures to the health department to initiate testing, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent transmission.\n\nEarly identification of infections is essential to control spread and protect health care workers. The CDC's updated webpage is a valuable resource for current outbreak information.\n\nPublic education is vital for a hospital's preparedness strategy. While the CDC states the current risk to the general public from H5N1 is low, preventive measures are essential, especially with the increased consumption of raw milk, a potential means of transmission. Public recommendations include avoiding contact with infected or dead animals and potentially contaminated surfaces or equipment, using PPE when necessary, and avoiding undercooked or raw foods such as unpasteurized milk. Hospitals should engage in community outreach to disseminate this information and encourage individuals to seek medical care if they suspect an infection.\n\nThe emergence of an H5N1 bird flu epidemic in the U.S. highlights the persistent threat of this virus.

Here's what to know.", "body": "Over the past few months, a bird flu outbreak has spread swiftly through dairy cows in the United States, infecting more than 90 herds in 12 states. Along the way, the virus has caused collateral damage in several other species, spreading from dairies to poultry farms and from cows into at least three farmworkers, who developed symptoms of mild illness.\n\nIt has also caused mounting casualties in cats. On some dairy farms, sick or dead cats have provided an early signal that something was amiss. \"They're a bit of a canary in a coal mine,\" Dr. Kammy Johnson, a veterinary epidemiologist for the Agriculture Department, said at a news briefing Thursday.\n\nSince the dairy outbreak was first detected in late March, at least 21 cats in nine states have caught the virus, according to the department, which recently began tracking the feline cases.\n\nScientists have long known that cats are vulnerable to being infected by avian influenza, a group of flu viruses typically found in birds. In 2020, a new version of a bird flu virus, known as H5N1, emerged. It has spread rapidly around the world, infecting many wild birds and repeatedly spilling over into mammals, including cats.\n\n\"Domestic cats are actually highly susceptible to avian influenza, and especially H5N1,\" said Kristen Coleman, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Maryland. \"But there has been a recent uptick in domestic cat infections, a drastic uptick.\"\n\nThere have been sporadic reports of infected dogs, too.\n\nWhile bird flu infections of pets remain rare overall, they can be severe, especially in cats. \"It results in very severe illness and oftentimes death,\" Coleman said. \"So it's very serious, and it should be taken seriously.\"\n\nBut a few \"reasonable precautions\" can help people keep their pets safe, she said.\n\nOn dairy farms, cats were infected after drinking unpasteurized milk, also known as raw milk, which contains very high levels of the virus, from sick cows. More than 80% of affected dairy farms had cats on their premises, and more than half of those farms reported sick or dead cats, according to federal data released Thursday.\n\nBut even before the recent dairy outbreak, there were reports of infected cats, some of which probably caught the virus when they preyed upon infected birds. \"As we get more dead, wild birds on the landscape, if we get more dead poultry on the landscape, these carnivores that may get into them and ingest them, even after they're dead, are getting just a massive dose of virus,\" said Dr. Justin Brown, a wildlife veterinarian at Penn State.\n\nA few larger outbreaks have also been linked to contaminated raw poultry. In 2023, for instance, bird flu outbreaks hit two cat shelters in Seoul, South Korea. Government investigators there subsequently found the virus in raw duck meat fed to the cats.\n\nHow does bird flu affect cats?\n\nCats infected by the virus often become severely ill, and in some instances, the mortality rate has been \"shockingly high,\" said Dr. Younjung Kim, a veterinary epidemiologist at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research. At one affected cat shelter in South Korea, he noted, 38 of 40 cats died.\n\nIn a recent review, which has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, Coleman found that the new version of H5N1 had a 67% mortality rate in felines. (That calculation is primarily based on domestic cats, although it includes a handful of cases in other species, such as bobcats and lynx.)\n\nMany infected cats develop fevers, loss of appetite and respiratory symptoms, which may include nasal discharge, difficulty breathing and pneumonia. Neurological symptoms, including stiffness, tremors and seizures, are common, too. \"Sometimes this is confused for rabies,\" Coleman said.\n\nInfections in cats can also be asymptomatic, although it remains unclear how common that is, since mild or asymptomatic cases may escape detection.\n\nAre cats spreading the virus to people or other animals?\n\nIt's unclear. \"We do not fully understand whether or not they are capable of transmitting,\" Johnson said. There is not yet any evidence that cats have been contributing to the spread of the virus on dairy farms, she added.\n\nIn the case of the outbreaks at the Korean cat shelters, scientists aren't sure whether all of the sick cats contracted the virus from contaminated food or whether some of the animals caught the virus from each other.\n\n\"It was a very good opportunity to study cat-to-cat transmission,\" said Kim, who published a paper on the outbreaks. But by the time the virus was detected, many of the dead cats had already been disposed of, he said, making the epidemiological investigation difficult. \"So we don't know the extent of the viral transmission,\" he said.\n\nHowever, previous studies have shown that cats can spread some bird flu viruses to each other and to people. In 2004, a laboratory study revealed that cats infected with an earlier version of H5N1 were capable of shedding the virus and infecting other cats.\n\nAnd in 2016, a different bird flu virus, known as H7N2, tore through the cats at a New York City animal shelter. At least two people -- a veterinarian and a shelter worker -- also became infected, investigators found. Both people had mild symptoms and recovered.\n\nAre dogs at risk, too?\n\nYes. There have been a handful of cases, including serious ones, reported in dogs.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, a dog in Ottawa, Ontario, was infected with H5N1 and died \"after chewing on a wild goose,\" according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. That same year, an infected dog in Poland developed a severe cough and other symptoms but recovered.\n\nOverall, however, dogs seem to be less susceptible to the virus than cats are and appear less likely to develop severe disease.\n\nFor a recent study, Brown and his colleagues analyzed blood samples from nearly 200 hunting dogs in Washington. The researchers looked for antibodies to the virus, which would indicate that the dogs had previously been infected by it.\n\n\"And we looked specifically at waterfowl hunting dogs because they are going to be the ones that are actively in infected habitats and retrieving infected birds in their mouth,\" Brown said. \"We figured that was about as high a risk group as you could get.\"\n\nJust four of the dogs had antibodies; none had developed any symptoms or passed the virus on to other dogs in their households, the researchers found. The results suggest that the virus is not well adapted to dogs, which may require very high doses of virus in order to become infected, Brown said.\n\nStill, Brown cautioned, the virus can change quickly, and it could become a bigger threat to dogs in the future. \"I think we always have to be ready for that change to occur,\" he said.\n\nHow can I protect my pet from bird flu?\n\nPets that remain indoors should be at exceedingly low risk, experts said. But owners should avoid feeding their pets raw milk or raw meat, which both could potentially transmit the virus.\n\nOf course, an entirely indoor lifestyle is not possible for many pets. \"We're not asking you to lock your pet up,\" Coleman said. So owners should take common-sense safety measures with outdoor pets, including to try to keep them away from sick or dead birds and from places where wild waterfowl congregate, experts said. Removing shared food and water sources, such as bird feeders and baths, may also help curb the spread of the virus.\n\nPaying attention to the local situation can help, too; owners may want to keep their pets indoors more, or supervise them more closely, if bird flu outbreaks have recently been reported in their area.\n\nAs always, pet owners should monitor their animals for signs of illness, especially if their pets have had recent exposure to sick or dead birds, and consult a veterinarian if they have concerns.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York

The study, which has been released as a preprint whilst awaiting peer review, suggests that cat owners should remain vigilant for signs of illness in their pets, which could also put themselves, their veterinarians, and any other close contacts at risk.\n\nThe highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus currently affecting cattle on US dairy farms has already proven itself quite capable of infecting lots of mammal species - approximately 27 at the last count, according to ex-CDC director Robert Redfield. But while infections in dolphins and polar bears are certainly scientifically important, it's the animals that live alongside humans that are raising the biggest red flags for epidemiologists.\n\nThree farm workers are known to have contracted the virus in the US this year after contact with infected cattle. As well as making the jump from birds into cows, the disease has found its way into other farm animals - some unfortunate alpacas in Idaho, and farm cats thought to have succumbed after feasting on raw milk.\n\nWhile you might not necessarily think to put \"bird flu\" and \"alpacas\" together in the same sentence, scientists have long been aware that cats are vulnerable to avian flu - but what is the risk for our beloved pets, and for us as owners? Researchers at the University of Maryland combed through 20 years of published data on the spread of bird flu in feline species to try and find out.\n\nMapping the period between 2004 and 2024, the scientists noticed a sharp increase in reports of infections in domestic kitties - rather than wild or zoo-kept cats - starting in 2023. This tracks with the spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 in a number of species that have never previously been impacted by bird flu. Infections have also been reported in house mice, favored prey of house panthers everywhere, and we all know how much free-roaming cats like to chase birds.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that it is unlikely for humans to catch bird flu from cats, but it is possible, \"especially if there is prolonged and unprotected exposure to the animal.\" Veterinarians, veterinary nurses, and other professionals who work in close contact with potentially infected animals may therefore also be at risk, and the CDC issues guidance about the best use of personal protective equipment (PPE) in these cases.\n\nFor pet owners, the study's first author Assistant Professor Kristen Coleman, who researches airborne infectious diseases, had some suggestions for how to help keep your kitty safe. \"Don't feed your cat raw meat or raw dairy milk, and limit their unsupervised time outdoors,\" the author said in a statement. \"Cats prey on wild birds that could be infected, and they could get into raw dairy milk on a farm if it is not securely stored.\"\n\nThere have also been a handful of reports of feline-to-feline transmission of avian flu. This is the big fear for scientists concerned about a human pandemic - the more the virus adapts to mammalian immune systems, the greater the chance it could get a strong foothold in the human population.\n\nWhen cats become ill with bird flu, they often show difficulty breathing or behavioral changes, so be on the lookout for signs like these and seek veterinary advice promptly. H5N1 has also been reported to cause blindness in some cats.\n\nSadly, the mortality rate for the current H5N1 strain in cats has been shown to be high - around 67 percent.

Nearly 97m domesticated birds in the US have been affected by the highly pathogenic influenza since 2022.\n\nAlthough officials believe this outbreak was originally sparked by a single introduction from migratory birds into cows - for instance, via feed contaminated by bird feces - late last year, genomic analyses now suggest it is being spread between animals and farms by human activity, according a report released by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) on Thursday.\n\nThe report, which focused on cases in Michigan, found that transmission is likely happening when workers, cows, vehicles and equipment go to multiple farms.\n\nAmong employees at dairies with outbreaks, one in five employees work at other dairies and 7% work on poultry operations as well. That's in addition to the veterinarians, nutritionists and haulers who regularly visit multiple farms.\n\nThree in five Michigan dairies with outbreaks use shared vehicles to transport cows, but only 12% clean the vehicles first. All but one of the affected dairies belong to the same milk co-ops.\n\nThe results are in line with a second report also released by the USDA on Thursday, showing that about one-third of employees at US dairies with outbreaks also work on other farms with livestock - usually dairy farms, but sometimes swine and poultry.\n\nMore than half of affected dairy farms across the US share trucks and trailers to transport cows, and more than half of those who share vehicles don't clean them first, the report said.\n\n\"Biosecurity is the key to prevention,\" Kammy Johnson, a veterinary epidemiologist with the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, told reporters on Thursday. That means decontaminating everything that goes from farm to farm - transportation, clothing, equipment - and reducing the chances of infected animals, or people, passing the virus onward.\n\nIt's not clear if the outbreak is continuing to gain force, officials said, but they expect to find more cases in cows.\n\nAnd, as the virus evolves, it could become more of a threat to people, according to a recent report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Officials expect to see more bird flu cases among humans as the outbreak continues, the report said.\n\n\"The more infections there are among cows, the more risk there is for infections to occur among humans,\" Dr Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, told reporters on Thursday.\n\n\"The fact that it's in 20% of our milk supply should be disturbing to everyone because that means it's gone around already,\" Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said last week. \"If it starts to jump, that's when we really have to worry.\"\n\nYet testing has lagged, in a situation reminiscent of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe only authorized test for H5N1 among humans comes from the CDC, and it is only available to people who have symptoms and a history of close contact with infected animals or other people. So far, there have only been 45 tests performed this year.\n\nYet there have been reports of workers with positive flu A tests that are not sequenced for H5N1, as well as potential missed cases, like the farm workers and a local maternity worker who reported flu-like symptoms near the first confirmed human case this year in Texas.\n\nProviders may now be reluctant to test for influenza even if a patient has respiratory symptoms, since the flu season has ended and thus insurance companies may not pay for the tests.\n\nThe USDA requires lactating dairy cows to be tested before moving across state borders. The federal government does not have the authority to require testing of animals or people on a wide scale, which means these efforts largely fall to state and local entities.\n\nIn Wisconsin, for instance, which has not yet announced any infections in cows, farmers are now required to test cows before taking them to fairs and exhibits.\n\nCows have died in at least five states - South Dakota, Michigan, Colorado, Ohio and Texas - because they didn't recover or developed secondary infections after testing positive for H5N1. The majority of infected cows recover, but these deaths indicate the potential financial burden of an uncontrolled outbreak.\n\nBarn cats and mice have also tested positive for H1N1, raising concerns the animals could spread the virus in communities beyond the farms.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Here's What to Know.", "body": "By The New York Times | wordpress@medianewsgroup.com | The New York Times News Service\n\nOver the past few months, a bird flu outbreak has spread swiftly through dairy cows in the United States, infecting more than 90 herds in 12 states. Along the way, the virus has caused collateral damage in several other species, spreading from dairies to poultry farms and from cows into at least three farmworkers, who developed symptoms of mild illness.\n\nIt has also caused mounting casualties in cats. On some dairy farms, sick or dead cats have provided an early signal that something was amiss. \"They're a bit of a canary in a coal mine,\" Dr. Kammy Johnson, a veterinary epidemiologist for the Agriculture Department, said at a news briefing Thursday.\n\nSince the dairy outbreak was first detected in late March, at least 21 cats in nine states have caught the virus, according to the department, which recently began tracking the feline cases.\n\nScientists have long known that cats are vulnerable to being infected by avian influenza, a group of flu viruses typically found in birds. In 2020, a new version of a bird flu virus, known as H5N1, emerged. It has spread rapidly around the world, infecting many wild birds and repeatedly spilling over into mammals, including cats.\n\n\"Domestic cats are actually highly susceptible to avian influenza, and especially H5N1,\" said Kristen Coleman, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Maryland. \"But there has been a recent uptick in domestic cat infections, a drastic uptick.\"\n\nThere have been sporadic reports of infected dogs, too.\n\nWhile bird flu infections of pets remain rare overall, they can be severe, especially in cats. \"It results in very severe illness and oftentimes death,\" Coleman said. \"So it's very serious, and it should be taken seriously.\"\n\nBut a few \"reasonable precautions\" can help people keep their pets safe, she said.\n\nOn dairy farms, cats were infected after drinking unpasteurized milk, also known as raw milk, which contains very high levels of the virus, from sick cows. More than 80% of affected dairy farms had cats on their premises, and more than half of those farms reported sick or dead cats, according to federal data released Thursday.\n\nBut even before the recent dairy outbreak, there were reports of infected cats, some of which probably caught the virus when they preyed upon infected birds. \"As we get more dead, wild birds on the landscape, if we get more dead poultry on the landscape, these carnivores that may get into them and ingest them, even after they're dead, are getting just a massive dose of virus,\" said Dr. Justin Brown, a wildlife veterinarian at Penn State.\n\nA few larger outbreaks have also been linked to contaminated raw poultry. In 2023, for instance, bird flu outbreaks hit two cat shelters in Seoul, South Korea. Government investigators there subsequently found the virus in raw duck meat fed to the cats.\n\nHow does bird flu affect cats?\n\nCats infected by the virus often become severely ill, and in some instances, the mortality rate has been \"shockingly high,\" said Dr. Younjung Kim, a veterinary epidemiologist at the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research. At one affected cat shelter in South Korea, he noted, 38 of 40 cats died.\n\nIn a recent review, which has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, Coleman found that the new version of H5N1 had a 67% mortality rate in felines. (That calculation is primarily based on domestic cats, although it includes a handful of cases in other species, such as bobcats and lynx.)\n\nMany infected cats develop fevers, loss of appetite and respiratory symptoms, which may include nasal discharge, difficulty breathing and pneumonia. Neurological symptoms, including stiffness, tremors and seizures, are common, too. \"Sometimes this is confused for rabies,\" Coleman said.\n\nInfections in cats can also be asymptomatic, although it remains unclear how common that is, since mild or asymptomatic cases may escape detection.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nAre cats spreading the virus to people or other animals?\n\nIt's unclear. \"We do not fully understand whether or not they are capable of transmitting,\" Johnson said. There is not yet any evidence that cats have been contributing to the spread of the virus on dairy farms, she added.\n\nIn the case of the outbreaks at the Korean cat shelters, scientists aren't sure whether all of the sick cats contracted the virus from contaminated food or whether some of the animals caught the virus from each other.\n\n\"It was a very good opportunity to study cat-to-cat transmission,\" said Kim, who published a paper on the outbreaks. But by the time the virus was detected, many of the dead cats had already been disposed of, he said, making the epidemiological investigation difficult. \"So we don't know the extent of the viral transmission,\" he said.\n\nHowever, previous studies have shown that cats can spread some bird flu viruses to each other and to people. In 2004, a laboratory study revealed that cats infected with an earlier version of H5N1 were capable of shedding the virus and infecting other cats.\n\nAnd in 2016, a different bird flu virus, known as H7N2, tore through the cats at a New York City animal shelter. At least two people -- a veterinarian and a shelter worker -- also became infected, investigators found. Both people had mild symptoms and recovered.\n\nYes. There have been a handful of cases, including serious ones, reported in dogs.\n\nIn the spring of 2023, a dog in Ottawa, Ontario, was infected with H5N1 and died \"after chewing on a wild goose,\" according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. That same year, an infected dog in Poland developed a severe cough and other symptoms but recovered.\n\nOverall, however, dogs seem to be less susceptible to the virus than cats are and appear less likely to develop severe disease.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nFor a recent study, Brown and his colleagues analyzed blood samples from nearly 200 hunting dogs in Washington. The researchers looked for antibodies to the virus, which would indicate that the dogs had previously been infected by it.\n\n\"And we looked specifically at waterfowl hunting dogs because they are going to be the ones that are actively in infected habitats and retrieving infected birds in their mouth,\" Brown said. \"We figured that was about as high a risk group as you could get.\"\n\nJust four of the dogs had antibodies; none had developed any symptoms or passed the virus on to other dogs in their households, the researchers found. The results suggest that the virus is not well adapted to dogs, which may require very high doses of virus in order to become infected, Brown said.\n\nStill, Brown cautioned, the virus can change quickly, and it could become a bigger threat to dogs in the future. \"I think we always have to be ready for that change to occur,\" he said.\n\nPets that remain indoors should be at exceedingly low risk, experts said. But owners should avoid feeding their pets raw milk or raw meat, which both could potentially transmit the virus.\n\nOf course, an entirely indoor lifestyle is not possible for many pets. \"We're not asking you to lock your pet up,\" Coleman said. So owners should take common-sense safety measures with outdoor pets, including to try to keep them away from sick or dead birds and from places where wild waterfowl congregate, experts said. Removing shared food and water sources, such as bird feeders and baths, may also help curb the spread of the virus.\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nPaying attention to the local situation can help, too; owners may want to keep their pets indoors more, or supervise them more closely, if bird flu outbreaks have recently been reported in their area.\n\nAs always, pet owners should monitor their animals for signs of illness, especially if their pets have had recent exposure to sick or dead birds, and consult a veterinarian if they have concerns.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

These infections are part of a broader epidemic affecting dairy cattle, with more than 90 herds infected across 12 states.

Any cattle that becomes ill must be reported to the event veterinarian, and the affected animal should then be isolated from the rest, the guidance states.\n\nPost-show/event, livestock owners should isolate cattle for 30 days when returning home and continue to monitor their herds for signs of illness, CDA officials said in a news release.\n\nThe guidance comes more than a month after the issue was first brought up during a virtual town hall in which the state veterinarian provided an overview of bird flu in Colorado dairy cows.\n\nAt the time, Colorado had reported only two outbreaks among dairy herds - the first on April 25 and the second on May 8. As of Friday, that number had grown to 10, with the majority of those outbreaks confirmed within a span of 2 days last week.\n\nNationwide, 102 outbreaks of bird flu had been reported across 12 states.\n\nNational\n\nFederal officials pledge millions to contain spread of bird flu outbreak Lindsey Theis 6:10 PM, May 10, 2024\n\nIt's not clear how much a federal order put in place on April 24 and adopted by the state not long after will be able to mitigate transmission among dairy herds, as the virus appears to be spreading among cows who aren't showing any symptoms and testing remains voluntary and encouraged only for visibly sick animals, according to STAT News.\n\nSigns of HPAI in dairy cows include decreased feed intake, a significant drop in milk production and milk that is thicker and discovered. Other signs producers should watch out for in their herds are slight fevers and tacky stools, state veterinarian Dr. Maggie Baldwin has previously said.\n\nDuring the May 8 virtual town hall, Baldwin also said that even though HPAI leads to severe disease and death in bird populations, H5N1 was not having the same effect in dairy cattle.\n\nA recent Reuters report, however, stated that some cows infected with bird flu have died in at least five states, including Colorado. Denver7 has not been able to independently confirm that information.\n\nHow can I protect myself from catching bird flu?\n\nFederal and state officials maintain that the risk of catching bird flu for the general public is low, though risk depends on exposure, according to Dr. Rachel Herlihy, the state epidemiologist at the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE).\n\n\"People who are exposed to sick birds and cattle are more likely to get infected,\" she said during the May 8 town hall.\n\nSo far, three farm workers have contracted bird flu after coming into contact with sick cattle, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). None developed severe symptoms.\n\nNo human-to-human transmission of bird flu has been detected thus far, CDC officials added.\n\nThe nation's top public health agency recommends that farm workers who come into contact with cattle suspected or confirmed to be infected with H5N1 wear gloves, disposable fluid-resistant coveralls, vented safety goggles or a face shield, and an N95 respirator.\n\nAs of May 28, 113 dairy workers were being monitored for bird flu in Colorado, when only 4 outbreaks among dairy herds had been confirmed by the state. Denver7 is working to learn how many more workers are now being monitored now that the number of outbreaks in Colorado has increased to 10.\n\nThe CDPHE is working with producers on educating workers frequently exposed to sick poultry or cattle about the measures they can take to protect themselves. The agency also has PPE available for any affected dairies or for any dairy that would like to provide it to their workers, though it's not clear how many dairy farms have inquired about PPE for their workers.\n\nThe general public should avoid contact with sick birds or other animals to reduce their chances of becoming infected with bird flu, Herlihy said. If you must handle sick or dead birds or animals, be sure to wear gloves, a high-quality mask such as a KN95 or N95 respirator, and eye protection. After handling the animal, double bag it and throw it away in your municipal trash can before thoroughly washing your hands.\n\nCan I catch bird flu from drinking milk or eating meat?\n\nThough early research lead by Federal Drug Administration (FDA) detected remnants of bird flu in retail milk, follow-up studies in which scientists tried to grow live virus from those grocery store samples did not yield any positive results.\n\nFurther testing done by the FDA in mid-to-late April on nearly 300 dairy samples from 17 states also failed to detect any live, infectious virus, which adds weight to previous statements made by the agency that pasteurization is killing H5N1 in milk.\n\nOther milk-related products that undergo pasteurization, such as cheeses, sour creams, yogurts, butters, etc., are also safe to eat, health officials said.\n\nFDA officials have said the likelihood that eggs will contain H5N1 is low \"due to the safeguards in place, which include testing of flocks and federal inspection programs,\" that call for the disposal of eggs and meat from infected poultry. Proper egg storage and preparation \"further reduce the risk,\" they said.\n\nPeople should avoid raw milk and dairy products made from raw milk at the moment, scientists told STAT News in late April, as raw milk does not go through the process of pasteurization, which kills harmful viruses and bacteria. In Texas, a large number of cats who were fed raw milk suffered brain damage and later died, though scientists said they could not completely rule out if eating dead birds were the initial pathway to the cats getting sick instead of drinking raw milk.\n\nEarlier this month, the FDA sent a letter to states around the nation to minimize the risks of H5N1 in raw milk, though they warn that further studies need to take place to determine whether bird flu can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of raw milk or products made from raw milk.\n\nRaw milk can't be sold in Colorado and a bill aimed at legalizing it for sale across the state died in the legislature this year, though Coloradans could still get it if they enter what's called a herd-share agreement.\n\nThough Colorado has not tested swine and beef cattle for bird flu, ground beef appears to be safe for consumption after USDA officials found no virus in retail meat from states with bird flu outbreaks following at least three studies, including one in which the meat was cooked to varying levels of preparedness.\n\nThe state veterinarian previously said the FDA was looking at expanding testing to other cattle species, though a timeline of when that would happen was not immediately known.\n\nThe Follow Up What do you want Denver7 to follow up on?

By some calculations, H5N1 bird flu is still at least two mutations away from widespread human infections, but experts warn that new flu symptoms in individuals at high risk are likely to start turning up in health systems this summer.\n\n\"There is a broad range of symptoms to be watching for,\" said Vivien Dugan, PhD, director of the influenza division at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \"Some of this will not be obvious or at the forefront of our minds.\"\n\nDugan is leading the team of CDC scientists that is working with partners from the US Department of Agriculture, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and state and local health departments to track and respond to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak currently sweeping through the US.\n\nSince 2022, avian influenza A viruses have been detected in more than 9300 wild birds in 50 states and territories and in commercial and backyard flocks.\n\n\"It's a bad situation,\" said Florian Krammer, PhD, professor of vaccinology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \"Globally, we've seen tons of exposure in cities around the world and even in the birds here in New York City where I am.\"\n\nBirds shed the virus in their saliva, mucous, and feces, so people or other animals with close, unprotected contact with infected birds or their contaminated environments can be infected.\n\nAnd for the first time in March 2024, H5N1 bird flu was reported in dairy cows. The US Department of Agriculture said that at last count 101 dairy herds in 12 states had been infected, with several cases also found in dairy workers.\n\nThe National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the infections were highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b of Eurasian lineage. Also known as the goose, Guangdong clade from China, phylogenetic analysis and epidemiology suggests a single introduction into cows followed by onward transmission.\n\n\"I was surprised when H5 was introduced to dairy cattle in this way,\" Dugan said during an interview. \"Influenza viruses are always surprising us and it reminds me to stay humble and keep an open mind when dealing with them.\"\n\nPeople rarely inhale or get sufficient virus in their eyes or mouth to get sick, Dugan said, but those in close contact with animals are still at risk for infection, which could lead to upper respiratory tract symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, sore throat, or runny or stuffy nose.\n\nThe risk to the general public is still low, Dugan said, but authorities recommend that people working with animals wash their hands with soap and water and wear personal protective equipment that includes fluid-resistant coveralls, a waterproof apron, a safety-approved respirator, properly fitted goggles or face shield, a head or hair cover, gloves, and boots.\n\nDugan said that healthcare providers often don't take a history of occupational exposures when a patient presents with flu. But with rising rates of bird flu in new animal hosts, \"this will be an important next step.\"\n\nThis approach is not standardized on most electronic health records, so these are questions that clinicians will need to initiate themselves.\n\n\"Physicians should ask about work,\" said Meghan Davis, PhD, associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. \"If it's not already on the radar, asking about any direct contact with dairy cows, poultry, pigs, wild birds or wild mammals is important.\"\n\nDavis says she's worried about a new study tracking risk factors for farm-to-farm transmission because it shows that farms testing positive for avian influenza often have workers with a family member also employed on another farm. \"This suggests that we might need to be on the lookout for possible transmission within families,\" she said. Now, we have to ask \"not just if the person with symptoms has contact with or works on a dairy farm, milk processing plant, or slaughterhouse, but also if any family member does.\"\n\nDavis said that it's important to bear in mind when taking these histories that there may be younger workers on farms and in slaughter and processing facilities due to exemptions or illegal work.\n\nWhat is important now is to get the situation under control this season in dairy cattle, Krammer said. \"This will be easier to stop in cows than humans, so this is the time to stop moving dairy cattle and start vaccinating them.\"\n\nSince April 2024, there have been three human cases of avian influenza after exposure to dairy cows reported. \"And what we don't want to see this summer is an unusual human cluster of influenza. It's important we keep a close, watchful eye for this,\" Krammer said.\n\n\"Influenza viruses do very interesting things and as we head into fall and winter flu season, we don't want new human co-infections that could cause major problems for us,\" he said.\n\nIf people become mixing vessels of a seasonal cocktail of multiple viruses, that could empower H5N1 to mutate again into something more dangerous, sparking a new pandemic.\n\n\"It wasn't all that long ago that we were asking China difficult questions about the steps Chinese authorities took to protect human lives from SARS-CoV-2 in the COVID pandemic. Now, we must ask ourselves many of these questions,\" Krammer said. \"We are at a crucial crossroad where we will either elude a new pandemic or see one take off, risking 10 to 20 million lives.\"\n\nThere is a precedent for safely evading more trouble, Krammer pointed out. Government agencies have already been working with the poultry industry for a couple of years now. \"And here, we have successfully stopped H5N1 with new regulations and policies.\"\n\nBut moving from poultry farms to cattle has not been an easy transition, Dugan said. Cattle farms have no experience with bird flu or tactics to contain it with regulations, and officials too are working in new, unfamiliar terrain.\n\n\"What we have now isn't a science problem, it's a policy issue, and it hasn't always been clear who is in charge,\" Krammer said.\n\n\"Agencies are working together at the state, federal, and global level,\" said Dugan. \"We are increasing our transparency and are working to share what we know, when we know it.\"\n\nThe infrastructure built during the COVID pandemic has helped teams prepare for this new crisis, Dugan said. Year-round, layered monitoring has clinical labs reporting seasonal influenza and novel cases.\n\n\"Laboratories are ready to help with testing,\" Dugan said.\n\nSpecimens should be collected as soon as possible from patients with flu symptoms. A nasopharyngeal swab is recommended with a nasal swab combined with an oropharyngeal swab. If a patient has conjunctivitis with or without respiratory symptoms, both a conjunctival swab and a nasopharyngeal swab should be collected.\n\nPeople with severe respiratory disease should also have lower respiratory tract specimens collected.\n\nStandard, contact, and airborne precautions are recommended for patients presenting for medical care who have illness consistent with influenza and recent exposure to birds or other animals.\n\nThere are four FDA-approved antivirals for influenza:\n\nFor people with suspected or confirmed avian influenza, treatment is recommended as soon as possible.\n\nThere are no clinical trials measuring the outcome of antivirals in people infected with avian influenza. However, data from animal models and human observational studies suggest a benefit.\n\n\"We can't afford to wait this summer,\" Krammer said. \"We have an opportunity right now to stop this in cows before we risk infecting more people. I hope we do.\"", "source": {"uri": "medscape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medscape"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icahn_School_of_Medicine_at_Mount_Sinai", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eurasia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saliva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saliva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangdong", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guangdong"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guangdong"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/gty_240619_avian_influenza_800x450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The number of documented infected dairy herds in recent weeks has risen rapidly -- and several other states have confirmed initial infections in cows.\n\nBut many dairy farmers are declining to test their cows, leaving the nation vulnerable to a situation in which federal officials won't have adequate warning if the virus evolves and poses a greater risk of infection to people.\n\n\"The longer this is prevalent in animal farms and livestock operations across the state, the greater the opportunity is for future mutations in animals or human risks in different ways going forward,\" said Tim Boring, who heads the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Michigan, a state with two confirmed human cases to date as it deals with a major bird flu outbreak among poultry and now dairy herds.\n\nThe federal response is largely focusing on voluntary efforts by farmers to help track and contain the outbreak. But many farms still have not signed up for USDA efforts to boost surveillance and testing for the virus. To date, 94 herds across 12 states have tested positive for bird flu, but the testing has covered a mere fraction of the nation's nine million dairy cattle. Only about 45 exposed and symptomatic humans have been tested for avian flu, CDC Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah said in a Thursday briefing with reporters.\n\nMark Lyons, a senior USDA animal health official, said federal officials are \"still working closely to understand the breadth\" of the bird flu outbreak in the nation's dairy herds.\n\nWhile the risk to the public remains low, the CDC is focusing on preventing cases in populations at higher risk of infection. Given the extent of spread among dairy cows, additional human cases in farmers and dairy workers \"would not be surprising,\" according to CDC spokesperson Rosa Norman.\n\n\"Continued comprehensive surveillance in wild birds, poultry, mammals and people worldwide are critical to determine the public health risk, along with ongoing preparedness efforts,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are taking a number of measures to keep up testing and sequencing of influenza viruses over the summer to help increase surveillance.\"\n\nJerome Adams, former surgeon general under President Donald Trump, said more testing is needed to understand how widespread avian influenza is -- a threat he described as rapidly growing and potentially catastrophic despite the limited human infections detected to date. But farmers and workers must be reassured that they will not face legal penalties by allowing government officials onto farms and there should be financial incentives to participate in testing, he added.\n\n\"We failed -- through two administrations -- to develop and implement an effective surveillance strategy with Covid, and we are repeating the same mistakes with [this virus],\" Adams said. \"Farmers are reticent to test for many reasons. Fear of financial harm is a major factor.\"\n\nSince April, more than 15,000 animal samples have been tested, with more than 4,300 under a federal order requiring dairy cow testing before animals are moved across state lines, according to USDA data.\n\nDeborah Birx, former Trump administration coronavirus response coordinator, said it is essential to know whether the baseline incidence of infections among dairy cows and humans is changing so the government can prepare a response.\n\n\"It's not about pointing fingers, it's not about whether their workers are documented, it's about knowing where we are and how much this is spreading in humans, and how much is spreading in cows,\" Birx said. Allowing voluntary anonymous testing and taking steps to allay fears that farms could be shut down is critical to get that buy-in, she added.\n\nA new effort by the CDC aims to ensure that clinical laboratories send samples from people with suspected novel influenza infections like avian flu to state health laboratories for further testing. The guidelines call for the CDC to be alerted of specimens that test positive for such viruses or if unsubtyped results are obtained.\n\n\"We have indicated to states that the threshold for testing somebody is exceedingly low if they do happen to detect somebody who has been exposed and who would like to be tested,\" Shah told reporters. \"We're open to doing that, very much so.\"\n\nHHS Secretary Xavier Becerra urged state leaders at the Western Governors' Association Annual Meeting to help increase monitoring for avian influenza.\n\n\"That includes reaching out to dairy farmers in your states to confirm they are taking steps to protect workers -- and encouraging those farms to test their cows or their milk so we know quickly if a herd is positive,\" Becerra said earlier this week according to prepared remarks.\n\nAlthough federal funds have been allocated, no farms have enrolled in voluntary on-site milk testing, according to the USDA. Fewer than a dozen farms have applied for separate financial aid in exchange for boosting biosecurity measures to help contain the virus. Meanwhile, federal rulemaking is delaying the rollout of compensation for farmers who have lost or had to kill cows because of the disease.\n\nThat's a problem because the scope of financial support for dairy farmers to date has been \"peanuts,\" according to Michael Mina, chief science officer at telehealth company eMed and a mass-testing advocate during the Covid-19 pandemic. With the virus spread across many herds across the country, strengthening sequencing efforts to understand if a mutation that warrants aggressive action toward a particular farm is critical.\n\n\"We actually did have a period of time where there was a possibility to contain this had we taken very aggressive fast action,\" Mina said. \"Those days are done. It's big and you can't just squash it.\"\n\nMichael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that even if every cow in the U.S. is tested daily, it does not guarantee that a mutation won't occur that starts a new pandemic.\n\n\"What I would like to know is in terms of transmission issues, is how many of these current farms that are turning up positive can trace back cattle movement to the original outbreak farms,\" Osterholm said. \"If that can't happen, it greatly complicates how you try to stop ongoing transmission in dairy cattle.\"\n\nMichigan, which is dealing with a major bird flu outbreak among poultry and now dairy herds, is undertaking an \"aggressive\" response effort, Boring said. There have been no confirmed avian flu fatalities in the U.S.\n\nIn recent days, Wyoming, Minnesota and Iowa have announced their first confirmed avian influenza cases in dairy herds, underscoring many agriculture officials' fears that the virus is present in wide swaths of the country but just hasn't yet been detected.\n\nShah deferred to USDA when asked how much dairy cow surveillance testing the CDC believes is necessary on a call with reporters on Thursday. State agriculture officials and some farmers pushed back on an early CDC effort to deploy federal public health officials on farms across the country to better track and contain the virus.\n\nSo far, 11 farms have enrolled in financial support programs the USDA announced May 10 to help bolster biosecurity measures to contain the virus, according to USDA spokesperson Allan Rodriguez. No farms have enrolled in a separate voluntary testing pilot program to monitor virus levels in milk in dairy herds, though there's been interest in the effort and the USDA \"expects the number of participating producers to increase in the weeks ahead.\" The department is talking with at least 20 states about participation in the pilot program.\n\n\"USDA continues to ramp up outreach and leverage every tool available to raise awareness of these new resources,\" Rodriguez added.\n\nDr. Jamie Jonker, the chief science officer at the National Milk Producers Federation, said that \"any widespread disruption to an industry is going to encounter a wide variety of responses and questions.\"\n\n\"Only three months into H5N1 in dairy cows, testing is identifying affected farms, and dairy farmers are taking action in response,\" Jonker said. \"With USDA programs in effect for just over one month, farmers are working with USDA to make them effective, even as details of those programs are still being worked out,\" he added, noting dairy farmers are doing what they can both to understand the H5N1 situation and work effectively to address it.\n\nBoring said Michigan state officials are working to head off a potentially devastating blow to the dairy industry and to try to keep the virus from spreading to more humans. While the U.S. has responded to bird flu outbreaks in the poultry industry for decades, the outbreak among dairy cows is a new and vastly different challenge. Boring acknowledged state officials are still flying somewhat blind in their response after the virus was first detected in dairy cows in Texas in late March.\n\n\"It's a tough situation. There's a lot that we still don't know. We're learning more every day,\" Boring said.\n\n\"So oftentimes, we're working with a bit of incomplete information,\" he added.\n\nBoring said he believes several Michigan farms have reached out to the USDA for more information about the financial aid the department announced last month as a way to contain the virus, but he didn't know whether any farmers have applied for the USDA money.\n\nProducers in his state are chiefly watching the USDA's expected rollout of specific emergency assistance funding for livestock losses in the coming weeks. Agriculture officials in blue and red states are pressing the USDA to make that move as generous as possible to offset the growing economic toll of the virus, while working to contain the spread.\n\nBut that effort is \"continuing to go through the [federal rulemaking process],\" according to USDA, signaling that a full rollout could take months. It's also unclear how many infected cows in the U.S. are dying from bird flu or being killed due to a drop in milk production.\n\nBoring confirmed \"there have been instances of cow fatalities associated with this\" in Michigan, but he didn't know how many infected cows have been killed, or culled, in his state.\n\nHe suggested culling is still used in \"rare instances\" for infected cows that contract other diseases and wasn't aware of any mass culling.\n\n\"We're concerned about the spread of this into other populations, whether it's swine, or whether it's directly to humans,\" Boring said.\n\nStill, public health experts like Osterholm who have been monitoring avian influenza for decades caution that no one knows what the future holds.\n\n\"I've been dealing with this virus

H5N1 infected waterfowl are normally asymptomatic carriers, however, these birds can infect other species (including mammals) along their migratory routes. This global transference allows disease to spread, and for virus genetics and virulence to continually adapt.\n\nAlarmingly, evidence indicates that climate change seems to be impacting the emergence of zoonotic viruses like H5N1. As global climate conditions change, avian migratory patterns and routes are also changing. Higher temperatures and extreme weather has resulted in large-scale population shifts in a range of temperate species. These changes have led to diseases emerging in areas - and in genetic configurations - entirely unique and unprecedented.\n\nH5N1 is a clear indication that disease monitoring and response efforts are an essential part of any climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy.\n\nThe ecology and genetics of H5N1 viruses have evolved significantly since first being detected in China in 1997.\n\nThe H5N1 virus has been detected in the polar regions and the first confirmed case of a polar bear dying from H5N1 was recorded in Alaska in 2022. Antarctica has seen significant rates of mortality in its native elephant and fur seal populations as a result of viral exposure.\n\nNon-migratory wild birds are highly susceptible to H5N1 infections brought on the wings of their more transitory cousins. There have been approximately 75,000 bird casualties globally as per the World Animal Health Information System. However, efforts to accurately estimate the total number of wild birds which have died as a result of H5N1 are hampered by issues in data quality and availability.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2022 report on the state of wild birds in the United States estimated that over three billion birds have been lost in part due to climate related factors.\n\nOn land, the H5N1 virus has been detected in dairy cattle, and in 2024, a Texas agricultural worker was infected with H5N1. These cases suggest that H5N1 is adapting to infect mammalian hosts.\n\nIn March of this year, reports began to emerge of unusual deaths in young goats on a farm in Minnesota. That same farm had individuals in its poultry flock test positive for H5N1 and the goats and poultry shared similar spaces and water sources. It was later determined that the H5N1 strains in both the poultry and goats were highly related.\n\nIn May of 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the detection of H5N1 in alpacas on a farm in Idaho. Similar to previous cases, this farm also had a backyard poultry population test positive for H5N1 with unusually high amounts of the virus detected across the farm.

Meanwhile, cooler and wetter conditions can enhance the survival of influenza viruses in bird droppings and contaminated water.\n\nSimply put, the spread of influenza viruses around the globe is dictated by their ability to survive long enough in a place to be able to transmit elsewhere - and climate change is, in some cases, making this survival more likely.\n\nThe recent cases of poultry-to-human and cattle-to-human transmissions underscore the threats posed by these viruses and the importance of understanding how climate change is affecting their spread.\n\nThe H5N1 virus poses a significant threat to public health and the recent cases in the U.S. - coupled with H5N1's high mortality rates in humans - underscores the need for vigilant monitoring.\n\nDealing with viruses is always a challenge, however, climate change is upending many conventional understandings as shifting waterfowl migration patterns and environmental conditions force us to change strategies.

H5N1 infected waterfowl are normally asymptomatic carriers, however, these birds can infect other species (including mammals) along their migratory routes. This global transference allows disease to spread, and for virus genetics and virulence to continually adapt.\n\nAlarmingly, evidence indicates that climate change seems to be impacting the emergence of zoonotic viruses like H5N1. As global climate conditions change, avian migratory patterns and routes are also changing. Higher temperatures and extreme weather has resulted in large-scale population shifts in a range of temperate species. These changes have led to diseases emerging in areas -- and in genetic configurations -- entirely unique and unprecedented.\n\nH5N1 is a clear indication that disease monitoring and response efforts are an essential part of any climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy.\n\nH5N1\n\nThe ecology and genetics of H5N1 viruses have evolved significantly since first being detected in China in 1997.\n\nThe H5N1 virus has been detected in the polar regions and the first confirmed case of a polar bear dying from H5N1 was recorded in Alaska in 2022. Antarctica has seen significant rates of mortality in its native elephant and fur seal populations as a result of viral exposure.\n\nNon-migratory wild birds are highly susceptible to H5N1 infections brought on the wings of their more transitory cousins. There have been approximately 75,000 bird casualties globally as per the World Animal Health Information System. However, efforts to accurately estimate the total number of wild birds which have died as a result of H5N1 are hampered by issues in data quality and availability.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2022 report on the state of wild birds in the United States estimated that over three billion birds have been lost in part due to climate related factors.\n\nOn land, the H5N1 virus has been detected in dairy cattle, and in 2024, a Texas agricultural worker was infected with H5N1. These cases suggest that H5N1 is adapting to infect mammalian hosts.\n\nIn March of this year, reports began to emerge of unusual deaths in young goats on a farm in Minnesota. That same farm had individuals in its poultry flock test positive for H5N1 and the goats and poultry shared similar spaces and water sources. It was later determined that the H5N1 strains in both the poultry and goats were highly related.\n\nIn May of 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the detection of H5N1 in alpacas on a farm in Idaho. Similar to previous cases, this farm also had a backyard poultry population test positive for H5N1 with unusually high amounts of the virus detected across the farm. To date, 12 states in the U.S. have reported outbreaks of H5N1 with 101 dairy herds affected.\n\nThe discoveries of H5N1 on farms, alongside recent analysis of viral dispersal patterns, reiterate the importance of climate change shifting the migratory patterns of birds in the spread of viruses around the globe.\n\nClimate change and H5N1\n\nThere is increasing evidence that climate change is accelerating the global spread and emergence of new H5N1 variants with evidence that wider seasonal variation is enabling the emergence of novel H5N1 variants.\n\nIn North America, the warmer winters and earlier onset of spring which global warming is causing could allow some moisture-reliant pathogens to survive and spread more easily. Meanwhile, cooler and wetter conditions can enhance the survival of influenza viruses in bird droppings and contaminated water.\n\nSimply put, the spread of influenza viruses around the globe is dictated by their ability to survive long enough in a place to be able to transmit elsewhere -- and climate change is, in some cases, making this survival more likely.\n\nThe recent cases of poultry-to-human and cattle-to-human transmissions underscore the threats posed by these viruses and the importance of understanding how climate change is affecting their spread.\n\nImplications and mitigation\n\nThe H5N1 virus poses a significant threat to public health and the recent cases in the U.S. -- coupled with H5N1's high mortality rates in humans -- underscores the need for vigilant monitoring.\n\nDealing with viruses is always a challenge, however, climate change is upending many conventional understandings as shifting waterfowl migration patterns and environmental conditions force us to change strategies. Strengthening health-care infrastructure, and educating communities about H5N1 risks are essential components of a comprehensive response strategy.\n\nPromoting sustainable agricultural practices, such as improving biosecurity in poultry and cattle farms, reducing livestock population density and enhancing barn ventilation systems, is crucial. Innovative smart farming technology can also help track viral infections in poultry barns.\n\nConservation efforts are essential to maintain healthy ecosystems and minimize viral spread. Restoring natural habitats can mitigate the effects of climate change on wild bird populations, thereby reducing the risk of H5N1 spillover.\n\nIn the future, global leaders will need to be vigilant with respect to the trajectory of H5N1. International collaboration on disease management will be crucial for implementing climate adaptation strategies to safeguard the health of both our planet and its inhabitants against viruses like H5N1.\n\n___\n\nShayan Sharif receives funding from Ontario Agri-Food Innovation Alliance.\n\nNitish Boodhoo does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\n___\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The current strain of H5N1 has been spreading to animals that have never been affected before, and pets that can pass it to people could play a role in how it evolves.\n\nBeginning in Texas this April, dairy cattle in 12 states have contracted bird flu, as have three people who worked with infected cows in Texas and Michigan. Along with the infected workers in Texas, two farm cats fed unpasteurized milk also caught the illness.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provides guidance for veterinarians working with potentially infected animals, said the risk of contracting the disease from pets is low, but Coleman suggested pet owners should take precautions to protect their cats and themselves.\n\n\"Don't feed your cat raw meat or raw dairy milk, and limit their unsupervised time outdoors,\" she said. \"Cats prey on wild birds that could be infected, and they could get into raw dairy milk on a farm if it is not securely stored.\"\n\nIn addition, the virus has been reported in house mice, which cats also prey on, so it appears the opportunities for cross-species transmission are increasing, and pet cats may be at increased risk.\n\nCat owners should also be watching for respiratory and neurological symptoms, and consider taking them to the vet if they seem to have trouble breathing or are acting unusually. The current H5N1 strain has also reportedly caused blindness in cats.\n\nSince the emergence of H5N1 in U.S. dairy cattle, 21 domestic cats have been reported to be infected. Full genetic sequences of the viral strains infecting two of these cats have been reported in the scientific literature. Coleman said sequencing and demographic data for the other cat cases are urgently needed.\n\nAvian influenza, or bird flu, was once a finicky disease, infecting mostly migratory waterfowl and farmed poultry. But since 2020, the highly infectious strain known as H5N1 began spreading among a wider variety of birds. It has recently been appearing in a growing number of mammals, even decimating whole colonies of sea lions throughout South America.\n\nAlthough the disease is new among many animals, cats have been occasional victims of avian influenza for decades, most likely because they eat birds and are exposed through sick or dead prey carrying the virus.\n\nColeman reported that the fatality rate for the current strain of H5N1 in cats has been around 67% -- in itself a good reason reason for pet owners to keep their cats inside and away from wild birds.

They found that antibody levels were low in people who were or weren't vaccinated against seasonal flu, hinting at little to no pre-existing immunity and that most of the population would be susceptible if the virus changed to a form that more easily spreads among people.\n\n\"This finding is not unexpected because A(H5N1) viruses have not spread widely in people and are very different from current and recently circulating human seasonal influenza A viruses,\" the CDC said regarding the study findings, which it included in a regular update on its response activities.\n\nThe risk to the general public remains low, and so far only three human infections have been reported in connection to the dairy farm outbreaks. All involved people who worked closely with cows.\n\nIn late May, federal health officials contracted with CSL Seqirus to fill and finish bulk supplies of one of two candidate H5 virus, enough for 4.8 million doses. The CDC has said the vaccine is a good match to the circulating H5N1 strain.\n\nGlobally, the main threat from the 2.3.4.4b clade viruses seems to be to people who have been exposed to infected animals. In a related development, Finland's health ministry last week announced that it will offer avian flu vaccine to people who may be exposed to the virus, such as poultry and fur-farm workers and veterinarians.\n\nThe ministry said it will receive a supply of the vaccine as part of a joint procurement among 15 European Union countries and that vaccination will begin as soon as possible. The vaccine was developed by Seqirus UK, Ltd.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed 6 more H5N1 outbreaks in dairy herds, lifting the US total to 102. The latest confirmations involved 5 farms in Colorado and 1 in Iowa.\n\nAlso, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, in two separate statements, has reported three more outbreaks in dairy herds, two more in Sioux County and one in Plymouth County, both in the northwestern part of the state.\n\nMeanwhile, Minnesota reported another outbreak in commercial poultry, which involves a

In a statement, the group said that, for both viruses, cows showed clear signs of disease such as a sharp drop in milk production, changes in milk consistency, and fever.\n\nThe researchers said the findings don't change their avian flu risk assessment, which they consider low, given that it already covers the chance of infections with other highly pathogenic H5 strains. \"Nevertheless, increased vigilance is recommended, and HPAI H5 should also be considered in investigations, especially in the case of unclear and frequent cases of disease in dairy herds,\" the team wrote.\n\nDirect infection of the udder is one of the transmission paths seen in US cattle, and extremely high viral levels have been found in the milk of infected cows. Recent tissue sample examination from US cows revealed that the H5N1 virus infects epithelial cells of mammary alveoli, prompting acute inflammation in the udder, which could explain the drop in milk production and high virus levels in milk.\n\nIt's not clear how the virus first jumped from wild birds to cows in the United States, but risk to ruminants has been present since the virus was first detected 27 years ago. The Loeffler Institute scientists referenced water buffalo in Asia that had contact with the feces of wild birds.\n\nKai Kupferschmidt, a writer from Science who has been tracking the experiments in cows, said on X today that the findings seem to answer one of the puzzling aspects of the H5N1 situation in US dairy cows: whether there is something special about B3.13 that led to the infections.\n\nThe Loeffler Institute researchers said they have tested about 1,400 serum samples from German cows from regions affected by avian flu, and so far no antibodies have been seen. The group also tested 350 tank milk samples from different regions, which were also negative.\n\nIn other H5N1 developments, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) over the last few days has confirmed 14 more avian flu outbreaks on dairy farms, raising the total to 116. The latest detections are from Iowa (4), Idaho (3), Minnesota (3), Colorado (2), and Texas (2).\n\nThe virus continues to turn up on poultry farms, and APHIS confirmed two more outbreaks in Minnesota, both involving commercial turkey farms. One is located in Pipestone County and has 73,800 birds, and the other is a facility in Swift County that houses 114,600 birds. Both are in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nAlso, APHIS recently confirmed 19 more H5N1 detections in house mice, raising the total to 66.

Since then, the agency has recorded cases in over one hundred herds across twelve states, as well as three human cases in Texas and Michigan.\n\nBut Connecticut public health officials and infectious disease physicians say that the current risk of bird flu to the general public remains low.\n\n\"The good news is the human cases are exceedingly low, and they're all so far from people that have had direct contact with lactating cows,\" said Manisha Juthani, commissioner of the Department of Public Health. \"For a regular resident in the state of Connecticut, the risk is low.\"\n\nScott Roberts, the associate director of infection prevention at Yale New Haven Health, said that the risk to humans through the consumption of animal products is also low.\n\n\"There's no evidence that live virus is reaching consumers through eggs or milk, and pasteurization kills the virus. Cooking foods such as chicken and eggs kills the virus,\" said Roberts, an expert on diseases like COVID-19 and flu.\n\nThe risk is slightly higher for farm workers, Juthani explained, but Connecticut is not currently one of the twelve states with an identified case in dairy cows.\n\nBryan Hurlburt, the commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Agriculture, said in a written statement that the department has been working to protect the state's livestock industry from an outbreak by monitoring lactating cows and working with DPH to distribute personal protective equipment to farmworkers and processors.\n\n\"The emergence of H5N1 is an opportunity to remind everyone -- urban, suburban, rural -- that animal health, environmental health, human health, and food accessibility/safety are all spokes of the One Health wheel,\" wrote Hurlburt.\n\nWhile the short-term risk is low, Roberts said that two aspects of the virus concern him in the long-term: its mortality rate and its ability to jump from species to species.\n\n\"When it does reach humans, it's very severe,\" said Roberts. \"Of the 900 or so cases that have been reported since this was first discovered in the late '90s, about half of them, or 50%, have died.\"\n\nBut so far in this outbreak, both humans and dairy cows have experienced only mild symptoms, said Juthani. In the three human cases, two people experienced conjunctivitis, or pink eye, and the third had symptoms of a mild upper respiratory infection. In cows, the primary symptom has been lower milk production for those that are lactating.\n\nRoberts also worries that the current strain of the virus started out in wild birds but has since infected several species, including foxes, house mice, bears and domestic cats.\n\n\"Clearly, this virus is evolving and learning how to jump across species. And so I think the natural question one has to ask is, 'How long until it evolves and adapts to the point where it can infect humans?' And the answer to that question might be 'never,'\" said Roberts.\n\nJuthani said human and animal interactions have always concerned her, and not just when it comes to the bird flu. As a former practicing infectious disease physician, she advised patients to use caution, for example, when interacting with farm or exotic animals while traveling.\n\n\"If you look at traditionally where any of these more concerning viruses or bacteria have emerged from, it is from those types of interactions,\" said Juthani. \"In general, my advice would be that if you are concerned, then I would try to minimize those types of interactions.\"\n\nDPH is partnering with other state and federal agencies to monitor the evolution of the virus.\n\n\"There has been very good communication in terms of what information there is federally and what we have here locally,\" said Juthani.\n\nThe department checks in weekly with the CDC and also stays in close contact with the Food and Drug Administration, Juthani said. DPH is also following the lead of the state's Department of Agriculture, since the current outbreak is primarily in animals.\n\nAgencies at the federal and state level are also using data to check for signs of an outbreak in humans.\n\nThe CDC tracks wastewater data for influenza A outbreaks and is watching for signs of an uptick in cases that would be unexpected for this time of year. DPH monitors symptoms for every patient that goes into ERs across the state and has been watching for upticks in symptoms related to this strain of the bird flu, like pink eye and upper respiratory issues.\n\n\"I want people in Connecticut to know that we are collaborating regularly so that we can be knowledgeable and be as best prepared to help people make informed choices as things potentially could evolve. And they might not, but if they do that's what our job is -- is to be prepared,\" said Juthani.", "source": {"uri": "ctmirror.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The CT Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katy_golvala@ctmirror.org", "name": "Katy Golvala", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lactation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasteurization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctivitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conjunctivitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Environmental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Dairy_Products", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Dairy Products", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/ctmirror-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20210726_ManishaJuthani_Hartford_YK_145-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Here's What to Consider.", "body": "In the US, a dairy-farm worker develops itching, blood-shot eyes. In Australia, a young girl falls ill after a foreign holiday and is rushed to hospital. In Mexico, another man, already ill and bed-bound, becomes seriously unwell and dies.\n\nEach of these recent cases was caused by a different strain of influenza virus. In each case, it was an animal virus, which should not normally have turned up in humans at all. Should stories like this worry us?\n\nWhen stories like this hit the news (and for influenza viruses, this happens quite often), journalists write to virologists and ask: how worried are you about this one?\n\nThe honest answer is that how any virologist really feels about a story depends on a lot of things, including our personalities: some of us are natural optimists, while others tend to catastrophise.\n\nBut our professional background does give us an idea of what to look for in a news story about a novel virus. When you next read about a novel virus in the news yourself, these are the questions that can help you decide how much of a worry it might be.\n\nThis is usually the first question. It's actually really hard for a virus to adapt to growing well in a new host species. Even influenza viruses - basically bird viruses, but notorious for causing repeated human pandemics - only manage it every few decades.\n\nFor a virus, crossing into people from a different animal host is a staged process. (I'm writing \"people\", but it's the same logic if you're worried about a virus crossing between any two host species, say, bird flu adapting to spread in cattle.)\n\nHave people been exposed to the new virus and developed immune responses, but with no signs of infection? If there has been a \"spillover\" infection of a human (whether or not this caused serious illness), is there any sign that the virus has adapted enough to spread onwards to other people? And if the virus is now spreading among people, is that spread still at a point where it can be contained?\n\nSurveillance is hard work that requires resources and cooperation, but it is hugely important in understanding and controlling outbreaks. So what do we look for?\n\nTesting people for immune responses to a virus (serology) tells us who has previously been exposed. Sequencing viral genomes (from infected people or from the environment) tells us where the virus is now, but it also lets us work out how it is spreading and how it is changing.\n\nWe can do this because viruses mutate quickly. Lining up the differences in their genetic sequences lets us build family trees (\"phylogenetic trees\"), which we can use to reconstruct how the virus got to particular places at particular times.\n\nAre we looking at one big outbreak or lots of separate outbreaks? Family trees can show us this. Looking at the changes in the virus' genome also lets us look for any telltale signs that it is adapting to a new species - assuming we understand the virus well enough to work that out.\n\nThe better we understand a virus, the more we can anticipate what it might do next. For some very well-studied viruses, like the influenza viruses, we know some of the genetic changes that are warning signs of adaptation to a new host species.\n\nWhat else can we look for? We worry more about viruses jumping between similar host species, because this is easier for the virus to do. Influenza that's already in a mammal is closer to being able to infect us than influenza from a bird.\n\nWe can look at likely routes of transmission - a respiratory virus is likely to spread more quickly than a virus spread through sexual contact. We can also try to guess at the outcomes of infection - viruses that cause serious disease are concerning, but in terms of spread, we also worry about less serious cases, which could lead to people spreading the virus without realising it.\n\nHowever, viruses are tricky things, and in practice, it's really hard to predict what they will do.\n\nThe current outbreak of H5N1 influenza A viruses in cattle is a good example of this. An influenza A virus infecting cattle and then spreading through milk were both huge surprises. And while H5N1 is known to be capable of causing very severe disease, it seems that some cattle are carrying the virus without serious illness.\n\nExperimental virology, in which animals and cell cultures are infected and studied under controlled conditions in secure laboratories, can be essential for understanding what a virus is really capable of.\n\nAdapting to humans is hard for a virus, so anything that gives a virus more chances to pull this off is a concern. Sustained outbreaks are more of a risk than one-off cases.\n\nWe worry more about viruses in animals with close contact with humans. H5N1 spreading in North American cattle is more worrying than H5N1 spreading in South American elephant seals.\n\nWe worry about viruses taking shortcuts to adapting. For influenza viruses, this can happen in hosts like pigs that can pick up more than one virus at the same time and allow them to swap bits of their genome with each other.\n\nAnd we worry about people doing anything that gives a virus more chances to get used to them. Things like drinking unpasteurised milk in areas where it could carry H5N1 influenza viruses, for example.\n\nWhat would happen if things did get worse? Do we already have vaccines to this virus or to one very like it? Is there the capacity for making large numbers of those vaccines and distributing them to large numbers of people? Do we already have antiviral drugs? Do we know what's needed to manage the symptoms caused by the virus effectively?\n\nHere, at least, it helps to face a virus like influenza that we've already been trying to fight for a long time.\n\nThe spread of a new strain of influenza virus around the world is just one of many viral threats, but the H5N1 strain of the virus has been doing a lot of things recently that cause us, as virologists, to watch it with concern.\n\nWhile isolated cases can be devastating for the people involved, the bigger risk to society comes from viruses that spread - and H5N1 influenza is now spreading, in US cattle as well as in birds around the world.\n\nImportantly though, what it is not doing at the moment is anything that we would associate with it spreading among humans.\n\nThe current mood among virologists is definitely not what it was in, for example, February 2020, when it became clear that SARS-CoV-2 was spreading uncontrollably among humans.\n\nBut bird flu is doing enough concerning things at the moment to make us pay close attention to it. Hopefully, if we do that, we can all prevent things becoming a lot more worrying than they are now.", "source": {"uri": "sciencealert.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScienceAlert"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immune response"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phylogenetic tree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Itch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spillover_infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spillover infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_sequence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nucleic acid sequence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/cgi_blue_virus.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-02-", "textStart": 6352, "textEnd": 6365}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

They constantly mutate, producing new strains that challenge immune systems primed to fight earlier varieties. That is what makes flu a life-long threat to humans and the animal species - mainly birds - that are vulnerable to it.\n\nSince 2020, a strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza called H5N1 has been decimating both wild and domestic birds.\n\nNow the same strain is spreading among US dairy cows, and has also infected several US farmworkers exposed to sick cattle.\n\nA man in Mexico recently died with a strain of bird flu, H5N2, that has not been seen in humans before.\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Heath Organisation (WHO) say the overall risk to the general public remains low, but public health officials remain on alert for any indication of the most feared outcome: human-to-human transmission that could trigger a pandemic.\n\nFormer CDC director Robert Redfield said in June that it is not a matter of if a bird flu pandemic will arise, but when.\n\nThe H5N1 strain was first discovered in 1996 in geese bred in southern China. It is proven to be alarmingly adept at jumping continents and species and has rampaged through captive and commercial birds across the globe. Governments have ordered millions of birds slaughtered to limit the contagion.\n\nA variant that emerged in 2020, clade 2.3.4.4b, paved the way for spread among mammals such as farmed mink in Spain and Peruvian sea lions. Wild migratory birds are thought to be the initial source of the infections in US dairy cows, possibly via contamination of their feed or water in late 2023.\n\nNot much yet. The strain is related to H5N1. Both are in the influenza A virus family. But there has been little research on H5N2. While the deceased patient in Mexico marks the first laboratory confirmed case of H5N2 in humans, researchers have identified people with antibodies that could signal prior infections.\n\nThe death in Mexico was surprising because the 59-year-old patient, who had underlying health conditions, had no history of exposure to poultry or other animals, which are the most likely source of disease.\n\n\"It's so crazy that we don't know where this is coming from,\" said Dr Katrine Wallace, an epidemiologist with the University of Illinois Chicago School of Public Health. The Mexican government is now monitoring wild birds for H5N2 as the strain has previously been reported in poultry in the Mexican state where the person lived.\n\nBird flu can be fatal. But the health implications for H5N1 in the US so far have been limited. Since the start of 2020 through May 3, 28 confirmed human cases of H5N1 bird flu had been reported to the WHO, resulting in eight deaths. People in close contact with sick animals have a higher risk of becoming infected.\n\nThe three people who have tested positive in the US this year - all farmworkers in close contact with dairy cows, the first in Texas in March and two in Michigan in May - reported irritated eyes.\n\nHealth authorities are looking out for conjunctivitis, a type of eye infection, as an indication that bird flu may be involved.\n\nThe latest case in Michigan also experienced an upper respiratory infection, raising concerns about transmission. The CDC is conducting genetic analyses to see if the virus has mutated in a way that could make it more dangerous.\n\nThe victim in Mexico - who also had chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and longstanding hypertension - died one week after developing a fever, shortness of breath and diarrhea.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthomyxoviridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orthomyxoviridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sea lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peru", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peru"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Peru"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/06/19/2024-06-05T224546Z637411202RC2958A8AV2LRTRMADP3HEALTH-BIRDFLU-MEXICO.JPG?VersionId=0_kRFr3BhgEY057lgzcr1KMR8q8jh5OQ", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Here are the questions you should ask", "body": "Ed Hutchinson, Senior Lecturer, Centre for Virus Research, University of Glasgow\n\nIn the US, a dairy-farm worker develops itching, blood-shot eyes. In Australia, a young girl falls ill after a foreign holiday and is rushed to hospital. In Mexico, another man, already ill and bed-bound, becomes seriously unwell and dies. Each of these recent cases was caused by a different strain of influenza virus. In each case, it was an animal virus, which should not normally have turned up in humans at all. Should stories like this worry us?\n\nWhen stories like this hit the news (and for influenza viruses, this happens quite often), journalists write to virologists and ask: how worried are you about this one?\n\nThe honest answer is that how any virologist really feels about a story depends on a lot of things, including our personalities: some of us are natural optimists, while others tend to catastrophise. But our professional background does give us an idea of what to look for in a news story about a novel virus. When you next read about a novel virus in the news yourself, these are the questions that can help you decide how much of a worry it might be.\n\nHow far has it got?\n\nThis is usually the first question. It's actually really hard for a virus to adapt to growing well in a new host species. Even influenza viruses - basically bird viruses, but notorious for causing repeated human pandemics - only manage it every few decades.\n\nFor a virus, crossing into people from a different animal host is a staged process. (I'm writing \"people\", but it's the same logic if you're worried about a virus crossing between any two host species, say, bird flu adapting to spread in cattle.)\n\nHave people been exposed to the new virus and developed immune responses, but with no signs of infection? If there has been a \"spillover\" infection of a human (whether or not this caused serious illness), is there any sign that the virus has adapted enough to spread onwards to other people? And if the virus is now spreading among people, is that spread still at a point where it can be contained?\n\nHow much do we know?\n\nSurveillance is hard work that requires resources and cooperation, but it is hugely important in understanding and controlling outbreaks. So what do we look for?\n\nTesting people for immune responses to a virus (serology) tells us who has previously been exposed. Sequencing viral genomes (from infected people or from the environment) tells us where the virus is now, but it also lets us work out how it is spreading and how it is changing.\n\nWe can do this because viruses mutate quickly. Lining up the differences in their genetic sequences lets us build family trees (\"phylogenetic trees\"), which we can use to reconstruct how the virus got to particular places at particular times.\n\nAre we looking at one big outbreak or lots of separate outbreaks? Family trees can show us this. Looking at the changes in the virus' genome also lets us look for any telltale signs that it is adapting to a new species - assuming we understand the virus well enough to work that out.\n\nWhat are we dealing with?\n\nThe better we understand a virus, the more we can anticipate what it might do next. For some very well-studied viruses, like the influenza viruses, we know some of the genetic changes that are warning signs of adaptation to a new host species.\n\nWhat else can we look for? We worry more about viruses jumping between similar host species, because this is easier for the virus to do. Influenza that's already in a mammal is closer to being able to infect us than influenza from a bird.\n\nWe can look at likely routes of transmission - a respiratory virus is likely to spread more quickly than a virus spread through sexual contact. We can also try to guess at the outcomes of infection - viruses that cause serious disease are concerning, but in terms of spread, we also worry about less serious cases, which could lead to people spreading the virus without realising it.\n\nHowever, viruses are tricky things, and in practice, it's really hard to predict what they will do.\n\nThe current outbreak of H5N1 influenza A viruses in cattle is a good example of this. An influenza A virus infecting cattle and then spreading through milk were both huge surprises. And while H5N1 is known to be capable of causing very severe disease, it seems that some cattle are carrying the virus without serious illness.\n\nExperimental virology, in which animals and cell cultures are infected and studied under controlled conditions in secure laboratories, can be essential for understanding what a virus is really capable of.\n\nCould it get worse?\n\nAdapting to humans is hard for a virus, so anything that gives a virus more chances to pull this off is a concern. Sustained outbreaks are more of a risk than one-off cases.\n\nWe worry more about viruses in animals with close contact with humans. H5N1 spreading in North American cattle is more worrying than H5N1 spreading in South American elephant seals.\n\nWe worry about viruses taking shortcuts to adapting. For influenza viruses, this can happen in hosts like pigs that can pick up more than one virus at the same time and allow them to swap bits of their genome with each other.\n\nAnd we worry about people doing anything that gives a virus more chances to get used to them. Things like drinking unpasteurised milk in areas where it could carry H5N1 influenza viruses, for example.\n\nWhat would the worst case look like?\n\nWhat would happen if things did get worse? Do we already have vaccines to this virus or to one very like it? Is there the capacity for making large numbers of those vaccines and distributing them to large numbers of people? Do we already have antiviral drugs? Do we know what's needed to manage the symptoms caused by the virus effectively? Here, at least, it helps to face a virus like influenza that we've already been trying to fight for a long time.\n\nThe spread of a new strain of influenza virus around the world is just one of many viral threats, but the H5N1 strain of the virus has been doing a lot of things recently that cause us, as virologists, to watch it with concern.\n\nWhile isolated cases can be devastating for the people involved, the bigger risk to society comes from viruses that spread - and H5N1 influenza is now spreading, in US cattle as well as in birds around the world. Importantly though, what it is not doing at the moment is anything that we would associate with it spreading among humans.\n\nThe current mood among virologists is definitely not what it was in, for example, February 2020, when it became clear that SARS-CoV-2 was spreading uncontrollably among humans. But bird flu is doing enough concerning things at the moment to make us pay close attention to it. Hopefully, if we do that, we can all prevent things becoming a lot more worrying than they are now.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

But many farms still have not signed up for USDA efforts to boost surveillance and testing for the virus. To date, 94 herds across 12 states have tested positive for bird flu, but the testing has covered a mere fraction of the nation's nine million dairy cattle. Only about 45 exposed and symptomatic humans have been tested for avian flu, CDC Principal Deputy Director Nirav Shah said in a Thursday briefing with reporters.\n\nMark Lyons, a senior USDA animal health official, said federal officials are \"still working closely to understand the breadth\" of the bird flu outbreak in the nation's dairy herds.\n\nWhile the risk to the public remains low, the CDC is focusing on preventing cases in populations at higher risk of infection. Given the extent of spread among dairy cows, additional human cases in farmers and dairy workers \"would not be surprising,\" according to CDC spokesperson Rosa Norman.\n\n\"Continued comprehensive surveillance in wild birds, poultry, mammals and people worldwide are critical to determine the public health risk, along with ongoing preparedness efforts,\" the spokesperson said. \"We are taking a number of measures to keep up testing and sequencing of influenza viruses over the summer to help increase surveillance.\"\n\nJerome Adams, former surgeon general under President Donald Trump, said more testing is needed to understand how widespread avian influenza is -- a threat he described as rapidly growing and potentially catastrophic despite the limited human infections detected to date. But farmers and workers must be reassured that they will not face legal penalties by allowing government officials onto farms and there should be financial incentives to participate in testing, he added.\n\n\"We failed -- through two administrations -- to develop and implement an effective surveillance strategy with Covid, and we are repeating the same mistakes with [this virus],\" Adams said. \"Farmers are reticent to test for many reasons. Fear of financial harm is a major factor.\"\n\nSince April, more than 15,000 animal samples have been tested, with more than 4,300 under a federal order requiring dairy cow testing before animals are moved across state lines, according to USDA data.\n\nDeborah Birx, former Trump administration coronavirus response coordinator, said it is essential to know whether the baseline incidence of infections among dairy cows and humans is changing so the government can prepare a response.\n\n\"It's not about pointing fingers, it's not about whether their workers are documented, it's about knowing where we are and how much this is spreading in humans, and how much is spreading in cows,\" Birx said. Allowing voluntary anonymous testing and taking steps to allay fears that farms could be shut down is critical to get that buy-in, she added.\n\nA new effort by the CDC aims to ensure that clinical laboratories send samples from people with suspected novel influenza infections like avian flu to state health laboratories for further testing. The guidelines call for the CDC to be alerted of specimens that test positive for such viruses or if unsubtyped results are obtained.\n\n\"We have indicated to states that the threshold for testing somebody is exceedingly low if they do happen to detect somebody who has been exposed and who would like to be tested,\" Shah told reporters. \"We're open to doing that, very much so.\"\n\nHHS Secretary Xavier Becerra urged state leaders at the Western Governors' Association Annual Meeting to help increase monitoring for avian influenza.\n\n\"That includes reaching out to dairy farmers in your states to confirm they are taking steps to protect workers -- and encouraging those farms to test their cows or their milk so we know quickly if a herd is positive,\" Becerra said earlier this week according to prepared remarks.\n\nAlthough federal funds have been allocated, no farms have enrolled in voluntary on-site milk testing, according to the USDA. Fewer than a dozen farms have applied for separate financial aid in exchange for boosting biosecurity measures to help contain the virus. Meanwhile, federal rulemaking is delaying the rollout of compensation for farmers who have lost or had to kill cows because of the disease.\n\nThat's a problem because the scope of financial support for dairy farmers to date has been \"peanuts,\" according to Michael Mina, chief science officer at telehealth company eMed and a mass-testing advocate during the Covid-19 pandemic. With the virus spread across many herds across the country, strengthening sequencing efforts to understand if a mutation that warrants aggressive action toward a particular farm is critical.\n\n\"We actually did have a period of time where there was a possibility to contain this had we taken very aggressive fast action,\" Mina said. \"Those days are done. It's big and you can't just squash it.\"\n\nMichael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that even if every cow in the U.S. is tested daily, it does not guarantee that a mutation won't occur that starts a new pandemic.\n\n\"What I would like to know is in terms of transmission issues, is how many of these current farms that are turning up positive can trace back cattle movement to the original outbreak farms,\" Osterholm said. \"If that can't happen, it greatly complicates how you try to stop ongoing transmission in dairy cattle.\"\n\nMichigan, which is dealing with a major bird flu outbreak among poultry and now dairy herds, is undertaking an \"aggressive\" response effort, Boring said. There have been no confirmed avian flu fatalities in the U.S.\n\nIn recent days, Wyoming, Minnesota and Iowa have announced their first confirmed avian influenza cases in dairy herds, underscoring many agriculture officials' fears that the virus is present in wide swaths of the country but just hasn't yet been detected.\n\nShah deferred to USDA when asked how much dairy cow surveillance testing the CDC believes is necessary on a call with reporters on Thursday. State agriculture officials and some farmers pushed back on an early CDC effort to deploy federal public health officials on farms across the country to better track and contain the virus.\n\nSo far, 11 farms have enrolled in financial support programs the USDA announced May 10 to help bolster biosecurity measures to contain the virus, according to USDA spokesperson Allan Rodriguez. No farms have enrolled in a separate voluntary testing pilot program to monitor virus levels in milk in dairy herds, though there's been interest in the effort and the USDA \"expects the number of participating producers to increase in the weeks ahead.\" The department is talking with at least 20 states about participation in the pilot program.\n\n\"USDA continues to ramp up outreach and leverage every tool available to raise awareness of these new resources,\" Rodriguez added.\n\nDr. Jamie Jonker, the chief science officer at the National Milk Producers Federation, said that \"any widespread disruption to an industry is going to encounter a wide variety of responses and questions.\"\n\n\"Only three months into H5N1 in dairy cows, testing is identifying affected farms, and dairy farmers are taking action in response,\" Jonker said. \"With USDA programs in effect for just over one month, farmers are working with USDA to make them effective, even as details of those programs are still being worked out,\" he added, noting dairy farmers are doing what they can both to understand the H5N1 situation and work effectively to address it.\n\nBoring said Michigan state officials are working to head off a potentially devastating blow to the dairy industry and to try to keep the virus from spreading to more humans. While the U.S. has responded to bird flu outbreaks in the poultry industry for decades, the outbreak among dairy cows is a new and vastly different challenge. Boring acknowledged state officials are still flying somewhat blind in their response after the virus was first detected in dairy cows in Texas in late March.\n\n\"It's a tough situation. There's a lot that we still don't know. We're learning more every day,\" Boring said.\n\n\"So oftentimes, we're working with a bit of incomplete information,\" he added.\n\nBoring said he believes several Michigan farms have reached out to the USDA for more information about the financial aid the department announced last month as a way to contain the virus, but he didn't know whether any farmers have applied for the USDA money.\n\nProducers in his state are chiefly watching the USDA's expected rollout of specific emergency assistance funding for livestock losses in the coming weeks. Agriculture officials in blue and red states are pressing the USDA to make that move as generous as possible to offset the growing economic toll of the virus, while working to contain the spread.\n\nBut that effort is \"continuing to go through the [federal rulemaking process],\" according to USDA, signaling that a full rollout could take months. It's also unclear how many infected cows in the U.S. are dying from bird flu or being killed due to a drop in milk production.\n\nBoring confirmed \"there have been instances of cow fatalities associated with this\" in Michigan, but he didn't know how many infected cows have been killed, or culled, in his state.\n\nHe suggested culling is still used in \"rare instances\" for infected cows that contract other diseases and wasn't aware of any mass culling.\n\n\"We're concerned about the spread of this into other populations, whether it's swine, or whether it's directly to humans,\" Boring said.\n\nStill, public health experts like Osterholm who have been monitoring avian influenza for decades caution that no one knows what the future holds.\n\n\"I've been dealing with this virus since 2003 and on multiple occasions, thought, well, this is it, it's going to go, and then it didn't,\" Osterholm said. \"That doesn't mean it won't go now, but it also means be careful, because, in fact, what we're seeing happen may not be indicative that we're going to see a major antigenic change in the virus.\"", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"},

H5N1 infected waterfowl are normally asymptomatic carriers, however, these birds can infect other species (including mammals) along their migratory routes. This global transference allows disease to spread, and for virus genetics and virulence to continually adapt.\n\nAlarmingly, evidence indicates that climate change seems to be impacting the emergence of zoonotic viruses like H5N1. As global climate conditions change, avian migratory patterns and routes are also changing. Higher temperatures and extreme weather has resulted in large-scale population shifts in a range of temperate species. These changes have led to diseases emerging in areas -- and in genetic configurations -- entirely unique and unprecedented.\n\nH5N1 is a clear indication that disease monitoring and response efforts are an essential part of any climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy.\n\nH5N1\n\nThe ecology and genetics of H5N1 viruses have evolved significantly since first being detected in China in 1997.\n\nThe H5N1 virus has been detected in the polar regions and the first confirmed case of a polar bear dying from H5N1 was recorded in Alaska in 2022. Antarctica has seen significant rates of mortality in its native elephant and fur seal populations as a result of viral exposure.\n\nNon-migratory wild birds are highly susceptible to H5N1 infections brought on the wings of their more transitory cousins. There have been approximately 75,000 bird casualties globally as per the World Animal Health Information System. However, efforts to accurately estimate the total number of wild birds which have died as a result of H5N1 are hampered by issues in data quality and availability.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2022 report on the state of wild birds in the United States estimated that over three billion birds have been lost in part due to climate related factors.\n\nOn land, the H5N1 virus has been detected in dairy cattle, and in 2024, a Texas agricultural worker was infected with H5N1. These cases suggest that H5N1 is adapting to infect mammalian hosts.\n\nIn March of this year, reports began to emerge of unusual deaths in young goats on a farm in Minnesota. That same farm had individuals in its poultry flock test positive for H5N1 and the goats and poultry shared similar spaces and water sources. It was later determined that the H5N1 strains in both the poultry and goats were highly related.\n\nIn May of 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the detection of H5N1 in alpacas on a farm in Idaho. Similar to previous cases, this farm also had a backyard poultry population test positive for H5N1 with unusually high amounts of the virus detected across the farm. To date, 12 states in the U.S. have reported outbreaks of H5N1 with 101 dairy herds affected.\n\nRead more: An ounce of prevention: Now is the time to take action on H5N1 avian flu, because the stakes are enormous\n\nThe discoveries of H5N1 on farms, alongside recent analysis of viral dispersal patterns, reiterate the importance of climate change shifting the migratory patterns of birds in the spread of viruses around the globe.\n\nClimate change and H5N1\n\nThere is increasing evidence that climate change is accelerating the global spread and emergence of new H5N1 variants with evidence that wider seasonal variation is enabling the emergence of novel H5N1 variants.\n\nIn North America, the warmer winters and earlier onset of spring which global warming is causing could allow some moisture-reliant pathogens to survive and spread more easily. Meanwhile, cooler and wetter conditions can enhance the survival of influenza viruses in bird droppings and contaminated water.\n\nSimply put, the spread of influenza viruses around the globe is dictated by their ability to survive long enough in a place to be able to transmit elsewhere -- and climate change is, in some cases, making this survival more likely.\n\nThe recent cases of poultry-to-human and cattle-to-human transmissions underscore the threats posed by these viruses and the importance of understanding how climate change is affecting their spread.\n\nDealing with viruses is always a challenge, however, climate change is upending many conventional understandings as shifting waterfowl migration patterns and environmental conditions force us to change strategies. Strengthening health-care infrastructure, and educating communities about H5N1 risks are essential components of a comprehensive response strategy.\n\nRead more: How climate change influences the spread of disease - four essential reads\n\nPromoting sustainable agricultural practices, such as improving biosecurity in poultry and cattle farms, reducing livestock population density and enhancing barn ventilation systems, is crucial. Innovative smart farming technology can also help track viral infections in poultry barns.\n\nConservation efforts are essential to maintain healthy ecosystems and minimize viral spread. Restoring natural habitats can mitigate the effects of climate change on wild bird populations, thereby reducing the risk of H5N1 spillover.\n\nIn the future, global leaders will need to be vigilant with respect to the trajectory of H5N1. International collaboration on disease management will be crucial for implementing climate adaptation strategies to safeguard the health of both our planet and its inhabitants against viruses like H5N1.\n\nNitish Boodhoo, Research Associate, Department of Pathobiology, University of Guelph", "source": {"uri": "allafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "allAfrica"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):The disease has also infected at least three farm workers, marking the first confirmed case of human infection in the country.\n\nIndiana officials said there have been no confirmed cases of H5N1 infection in cattle or humans in the state.\n\nBut detecting avian flu in cows in Indiana may not be as efficient as in other states: Indiana dairy farmers are not required to test their cows, in part because some are reluctant to report cases themselves.\n\nDennis Deller Spears, Indiana Board of Animal Health (BOAH)Said The department offered dairy producers the opportunity to become a pilot state for the federal government. Voluntary mass testing programHowever, no growers expressed interest in participating, and Indiana is currently not part of the program.\n\n\"BOAH has held multiple dairy industry information sessions and has heard from producers who are concerned about the disease and want information on how to prevent the virus from entering their farms.\" Spears said. \"This is all new for dairy farmers, and we're working with the dairy farmer and veterinary community to help them strengthen their preparedness efforts.\"\n\nAccording to the CDC, avian influenza is most commonly found in wild and farm birds around the world, but outbreaks occur periodically in other mammals.\n\nH5N1 avian influenza periodically causes large-scale outbreaks. Over 100 million dead birds It is spreading worldwide in 2022 and has been detected in dozens of mammal species. In the United States, the virus has been found in more than 200 mammal species, including cats, goats, and raccoons.\n\nThe virus is most commonly spread by eating or coming into contact with the feces or saliva of an infected animal.\n\nHowever, avian influenza viruses rarely infect humans. World Health Organization (WHO)A total of 889 cases of H5N1 virus infection have been reported in 23 countries between 2003 and April 1 of this year. According to federal health authorities, the most common symptoms in humans include bloodshot eyes (conjunctivitis), difficulty breathing, fever, cough, sore throat and pneumonia.\n\nThe first recorded cases of human infection in the United States were in 2022.\n\nA second case was reported in a dairy farm worker in Texas in March 2024. A third case in a dairy farm worker in Michigan was confirmed in late May.\n\nDespite cases in neighboring states, Indiana currently requires testing only for lactating dairy cows traveling across state lines, as required by a federal order issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) on April 29.\n\nSpears said Indiana has decided not to require testing at this time \"because we have not had any positive cases.\"\n\n\"We know that dairy farmers and veterinarians are aware of the clinical signs and are watching them closely because they have asked questions and subsequent tests have not come back positive,\" she said.\n\nSpears noted that more than 750 tests have been conducted on cattle being moved from Indiana to other states since April 29. But she said Indiana doesn't know exactly how many tests have been conducted overall because only non-negative results are reported to BOAH.\n\nState officials have been \"aggressively\" dealing with the current strain of H5N1 on and off since 2022, Spears continued.\n\nShe said BOAH was working \"closely\" with the poultry industry on \"awareness, biosecurity, prevention and preparedness\".\n\n\"They are prepared to respond and we are here to support and coordinate that response,\" Spears said, adding that \"BOAH has worked for many years to encourage good preventative measures against all kinds of diseases on all livestock and poultry farms through good biosecurity and relationships with private veterinarians.\"\n\nAcross poultry in the state, there have been just 12 total Hoosier outbreak reports since 2022. Most of those are linked to turkey flocks, and there are four affected duck flocks.\n\nIndiana regulators and industry groups say that's because the state's \"well-prepared\" system has largely kept the disease out of avian livestock.\n\nPoultry disease regulations in the country date back almost a century, and were enacted after disease outbreaks in farm chicken farms.\n\nHobart Clayton of Warsaw-based egg producer Clayton Brothers was among the farmers who urged the USDA to implement a cooperative regulatory program, according to Rebecca Joniskan, president of the Indiana State Poultry Association (ISPA).\n\nThe National Poultry Improvement Program was launched in 1935. The program sets standards, such as testing, and is used to monitor the health of the nation's poultry breeders, hatcheries and poultry products, according to the ISPA report. Website.\n\nISPA will administer Indiana's plan in collaboration with USDA and BOAH.\n\nJoniskan said poultry producers participate in a 365-day monitoring program whether or not there is a disease outbreak. If there is an outbreak, they do more testing. The plan prescribes some testing, and Joniskan said some testing is required by the commission.\n\nAfter deadly outbreaks in 2015 and again in 2016, poultry producers and the National Poultry Improvement Programme agreed to step up disease prevention efforts in 2018.\n\n\"The spread of this disease was primarily due to a biosecurity breach by an employee in a feed truck or a UPS delivery truck,\" Joniskan said. \"We looked at that situation, learned from it and said, 'We can do better at this.'\"\n\nBiosecurity efforts focus on the interior and exterior boundaries, she said.\n\n\"When you enter the barn, there's what we call a 'line,'\" Joniskan said. \"We try to be really careful when we cross that line.\"\n\nShe said farmers typically change into specialized clothing, including protective boots, gloves and coveralls, before entering. Disposable barriers are sometimes provided to visitors.\n\nAfter you leave, you will need to hang out the laundry or take it out to the trash.\n\nIt made a difference.\n\n\"80% to 85% of cases today are caused by disease being brought directly onto farms by wild birds or other wildlife, and in only 15% to 20% of those cases (epidemiologists) can prove there has actually been a biosecurity breach,\" Joniskan said. \"While we all sincerely hope that the disease will go away, we are pleased that the effort, money and time that has been put into biosecurity has, for the most part, actually paid off.\"\n\nSpears said one of the challenges of taking proactive measures now to stop avian flu from spreading to dairy cows is that it is difficult to prevent the virus on farms if it is spread by wild migratory birds.\n\n\"There is no surefire way to rule out all possible reservoir transmission of this virus,\" she said. \"Meanwhile, we are learning more about how the H5N1 virus acts in cattle and poultry. Symptoms of the disease vary widely and the risk of spread varies. We are educating farmers and working with their veterinarians to provide them with the latest information and advice on how to protect their livestock.\"\n\nShe went on to say that the virus spreads quickly through a flock, so poultry will die quickly.\n\nThat means a \"very different response\" at farm level than for cattle, where the virus makes them sick but \"the animals generally recover within a few days.\"\n\n\"That means that if there is an outbreak on a farm, it makes a big difference in containing the spread,\" Spears said. \"BOAH has a response plan in place to increase community surveillance in case any cows test positive.\"\n\nstill, Scientists and state officials have emphasized that the risk of bird flu becoming a human virus is minimal, and the CDC continues to explain the current risk that bird flu viruses pose to the general public. low.\n\nAgriculture officials said they would not begin monitoring dairy workers for avian influenza until the first cow was confirmed to be infected in the state.\n\nIndiana State Department of Health spokeswoman Lisa Welch said the department has a \"robust influenza surveillance system\" and that the agency will work with BOAH if H5N1 is detected in the animal population.\n\nShe said procedures were also in place to monitor and test people who have bird flu or who develop symptoms after contracting the virus.",

H5N1 infected waterfowl are normally asymptomatic carriers, however, these birds can infect other species (including mammals) along their migratory routes. This global transference allows disease to spread, and for virus genetics and virulence to continually adapt.\n\nAlarmingly, evidence indicates that climate change seems to be impacting the emergence of zoonotic viruses like H5N1. As global climate conditions change, avian migratory patterns and routes are also changing. Higher temperatures and extreme weather has resulted in large-scale population shifts in a range of temperate species. These changes have led to diseases emerging in areas -- and in genetic configurations -- entirely unique and unprecedented.\n\nH5N1 is a clear indication that disease monitoring and response efforts are an essential part of any climate change adaptation and mitigation strategy.\n\nH5N1\n\nThe ecology and genetics of H5N1 viruses have evolved significantly since first being detected in China in 1997.\n\nThe H5N1 virus has been detected in the polar regions and the first confirmed case of a polar bear dying from H5N1 was recorded in Alaska in 2022. Antarctica has seen significant rates of mortality in its native elephant and fur seal populations as a result of viral exposure.\n\nNon-migratory wild birds are highly susceptible to H5N1 infections brought on the wings of their more transitory cousins. There have been approximately 75,000 bird casualties globally as per the World Animal Health Information System. However, efforts to accurately estimate the total number of wild birds which have died as a result of H5N1 are hampered by issues in data quality and availability.\n\nMeanwhile, a 2022 report on the state of wild birds in the United States estimated that over three billion birds have been lost in part due to climate related factors.\n\nOn land, the H5N1 virus has been detected in dairy cattle, and in 2024, a Texas agricultural worker was infected with H5N1. These cases suggest that H5N1 is adapting to infect mammalian hosts.\n\nIn March of this year, reports began to emerge of unusual deaths in young goats on a farm in Minnesota. That same farm had individuals in its poultry flock test positive for H5N1 and the goats and poultry shared similar spaces and water sources. It was later determined that the H5N1 strains in both the poultry and goats were highly related.\n\nIn May of 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the detection of H5N1 in alpacas on a farm in Idaho. Similar to previous cases, this farm also had a backyard poultry population test positive for H5N1 with unusually high amounts of the virus detected across the farm. To date, 12 states in the U.S. have reported outbreaks of H5N1 with 101 dairy herds affected.\n\nRead more: An ounce of prevention: Now is the time to take action on H5N1 avian flu, because the stakes are enormous\n\nThe discoveries of H5N1 on farms, alongside recent analysis of viral dispersal patterns, reiterate the importance of climate change shifting the migratory patterns of birds in the spread of viruses around the globe.\n\nClimate change and H5N1\n\nThere is increasing evidence that climate change is accelerating the global spread and emergence of new H5N1 variants with evidence that wider seasonal variation is enabling the emergence of novel H5N1 variants.\n\nIn North America, the warmer winters and earlier onset of spring which global warming is causing could allow some moisture-reliant pathogens to survive and spread more easily. Meanwhile, cooler and wetter conditions can enhance the survival of influenza viruses in bird droppings and contaminated water.\n\nSimply put, the spread of influenza viruses around the globe is dictated by their ability to survive long enough in a place to be able to transmit elsewhere -- and climate change is, in some cases, making this survival more likely.\n\nThe recent cases of poultry-to-human and cattle-to-human transmissions underscore the threats posed by these viruses and the importance of understanding how climate change is affecting their spread.\n\nImplications and mitigation\n\nThe H5N1 virus poses a significant threat to public health and the recent cases in the U.S. -- coupled with H5N1's high mortality rates in humans -- underscores the need for vigilant monitoring.\n\nDealing with viruses is always a challenge, however, climate change is upending many conventional understandings as shifting waterfowl migration patterns and environmental conditions force us to change strategies. Strengthening health-care infrastructure, and educating communities about H5N1 risks are essential components of a comprehensive response strategy.\n\nRead more: How climate change influences the spread of disease - four essential reads\n\nPromoting sustainable agricultural practices, such as improving biosecurity in poultry and cattle farms, reducing livestock population density and enhancing barn ventilation systems, is crucial. Innovative smart farming technology can also help track viral infections in poultry barns.\n\nConservation efforts are essential to maintain healthy ecosystems and minimize viral spread. Restoring natural habitats can mitigate the effects of climate change on wild bird populations, thereby reducing the risk of H5N1 spillover.\n\nIn the future, global leaders will need to be vigilant with respect to the trajectory of H5N1. International collaboration on disease management will be crucial for implementing climate adaptation strategies to safeguard the health of both our planet and its inhabitants against viruses like H5N1.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis", "type": "wiki", "score":

The disease has also jumped to at least three farm workers -- among the nation's first confirmed cases ever of a human getting infected by the virus.\n\nIndiana officials said the state doesn't have confirmed cases of H5N1 infections in cows or humans yet.\n\nDetecting bird flu in Indiana cows might not be as efficient as in other states, however. Hoosier dairy farmers don't have an obligation to test their cows -- in part because some farmers may not want to self-report cases.\n\nDenise Derrer Spears, a spokesperson with the Indiana State Board of Animal Health (BOAH), said the agency has offered dairy producers the opportunity to be a pilot state in the federal government's voluntary herd testing program, but no producers showed interest in participating. Currently, Indiana is not enrolled in the program.\n\n\"BOAH has hosted multiple dairy industry briefing calls and has heard from producers -- they are concerned about the disease and are seeking information on ways to prevent introduction of the virus to their farms,\" Spears said. \"This is all new to dairy farmers. We are working with them and the veterinary community to help them ramp up their preparedness efforts.\"\n\nAvian flu is most commonly found in wild and farm birds worldwide, with periodic outbreaks occurring in other mammals, according to the CDC.\n\nH5N1, a particular strain of bird flu, periodically flares up more expansively. It was cited for causing more than 100 million bird deaths globally in 2022 and has been detected in dozens of species of mammals. In the United States, the virus has been detected in more than 200 different mammals, including cats, goats and raccoons.\n\nThe virus most often gets transmitted when one animal eats or comes in contact with feces and saliva from an infected animal.\n\nBut bird flu viruses rarely infect humans. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), from 2003 through April 1 of this year, 23 countries reported a total of 889 human cases of H5N1. Federal health officials said the most common symptoms in people include eye redness (conjunctivitis), respiratory difficulties, fever, cough, sore throat and pneumonia.\n\nThe first known case of transmission to a human in the United States was documented in 2022.\n\nThe second known case was reported in March 2024, in a dairy farm worker in Texas. A third case involving a dairy worker in Michigan was confirmed in late May.\n\nDespite cases in neighboring states, Indiana currently only requires testing of lactating dairy cattle that are moving across state lines, per the requirements of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) federal order issued on April 29.\n\nSpears said Indiana has not opted to mandate testing at this time \"because we have not had any positive cases.\"\n\n\"We know dairy farmers and veterinarians are aware and watching for clinical signs, because we have heard from them with questions and subsequent tests have not been positive,\" she said.\n\nSpears noted that more than 750 tests have been run on cattle moving out of Indiana to other states since April 29. But she said Indiana does not have a good accounting of how many tests have occurred overall, given that only non-negative tests are reported to BOAH.\n\nThe state agency has been dealing \"actively\" with the current strain of H5N1 off and on since 2022, Spears continued.\n\nShe said BOAH works \"closely\" with the poultry sector on \"awareness, biosecurity, prevention and preparedness.\"\n\n\"They are very ready to respond and we are here to support and coordinate that response,\" Spears said, adding that BOAH \"has long worked to encourage good preventive measures for all types of diseases on all livestock and poultry farms through good biosecurity and having a relationship with a private veterinarian.\"\n\nThroughout the state's poultry population, Hoosier outbreak reports have totaled just 12 since 2022. Most involved turkey flocks; as well as four affected duck flocks.\n\nIndiana regulators and industry groups say that's because the state's \"well-prepared\" system has largely kept the disease away from bird livestock.\n\nThe country's poultry disease regulations date back to almost a century ago. It came after disease ravaged farmers' hatcheries.\n\nHobart Creighton, of Warsaw-based egg producer Creighton Brothers, was among the farmers asking the USDA to implement a cooperative regulatory program, according to Indiana State Poultry Association (ISPA) President Rebecca Joniskan.\n\nThe National Poultry Improvement Plan launched in 1935. It sets standards - like for testing - used to keep tabs on the health of the country's poultry breeding stock, hatchery, and poultry products, according to ISPA's website.\n\nISPA administers the plan for Indiana, in concert with the USDA and BOAH.\n\nJoniskan said poultry producers partake in a 365-day surveillance program, outbreak or not. When disease strikes, they test more. The plan dictates some testing, and some, per Joniskan, the board requires.\n\nAfter another deadly outbreak in 2015 and 2016, poultry producers and the National Poultry Improvement Plan office in 2018 agreed to step up their anti-disease efforts.\n\n\"The spread of that disease was largely due to biosecurity breaches, you know, from feed trucks or even the UPS delivery truck people,\" Joniskan said. \"... We looked at that situation, learned from that situation, and said, 'We can make this better.'\"\n\nBiosecurity efforts, she said, focus on the threshold between inside and outside.\n\n\"As we go into a barn, we have what we call our 'line of separation,'\" Joniskan said. \"... We just try to be really careful about how we move across that threshold.\"\n\nFarmers, she said, typically change into dedicated outfits when they enter: protective boots, gloves, coveralls, and so on. Visitors might receive disposable barriers.\n\nAn exit is followed by a load of laundry or a trip to the trash.\n\nIt's made a difference.\n\n\"Somewhere between 80% to 85% of the incidents today are being caused by introduction of the disease directly to the farm by a wild bird or some other wild animal, and that only in 15% to 20% of the cases can (epidemiologists) show that there was actually a biosecurity breach,\" Joniskan said. \"We'd really like to see this disease go away, but we're pleased to see that the efforts, the money and time that has been invested in biosecurity has really paid off, in large part.\"\n\nSpears said one of the challenges of being proactive now -- and keeping the avian flu from spreading to dairy cows -- is the difficulty of preventing the virus at farms when it's spread by wild, migratory waterfowl.\n\n\"There is no fool-proof way to eliminate all possible exposures to that reservoir,\" she said. \"Meanwhile, we are learning more about how the H5N1 virus behaves in cattle vs. poultry. The disease manifests itself very differently, and the risk of spread is different. We are working to educate farmers and work with their veterinarians to advise them on the latest information and how to protect their herds.\"\n\nPoultry will die very quickly from the virus that will spread very rapidly through the flock, she continued.\n\nThat warrants a \"much different response\" at the farm level from cattle, where the virus will make the cow sick, \"but the animal generally recovers in a few days.\"\n\n\"That means control of spread once it affects a farm is very different,\" Spears said. \"BOAH has a response plan for additional area surveillance should we have a test-positive case in cattle.\"\n\nStill, scientists and state officials emphasize that the risk of bird flu becoming a human virus is minimal. The CDC additionally continues to describe the current risk to the general public from bird flu viruses as low.\n\nAgricultural officials said they won't start monitoring dairy workers for bird flu until the first cow infection is confirmed in the state.\n\nLisa Welch, a spokesperson for the Indiana Department of Health said the agency has a \"robust influenza surveillance system,\" and that IDOH collaborates with BOAH when H5N1 is detected in animal populations.\n\nShe said, too, that protocols are in place for monitoring and testing anyone exposed to avian influenza, and for those developing symptoms after exposure to the virus.", "source": {"uri": "tittlepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "tittlepress.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

How Heat Battles the Infectious H5N1 Flu Virus", "body": "Research shows that heating raw milk greatly lowers H5N1 virus levels, but traces might persist. Despite concerns from a U.S. cattle outbreak, ongoing FDA evaluations maintain that commercial milk is safe.\n\nLaboratory experiments show that the amount of infectious H5N1 influenza viruses in raw milk rapidly declined with heat treatment. The research was conducted by scientists at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nHowever, small, detectable amounts of infectious virus remained in raw milk samples with high virus levels when treated at 72 degrees Celsius (161.6 degrees Fahrenheit) for 15 seconds -- one of the standard pasteurization methods used by the dairy industry. The authors of the study stress, however, that their findings reflect experimental conditions in a laboratory setting and are not identical to large-scale industrial pasteurization processes for raw milk. The findings were published on June 13 in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nIn late March 2024, United States officials reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus called HPAI H5N1 among dairy cows in Texas. To date, 95 cattle herds across 12 states have been affected, with three human infections detected in farm workers with conjunctivitis. Although the virus so far has shown no genetic evidence of acquiring the ability to spread from person to person, public health officials are closely monitoring the dairy cow situation as part of overarching pandemic preparedness efforts.\n\nGiven the limited data on the susceptibility of avian influenza viruses to pasteurization methods used by the dairy industry, scientists at NIAID's Rocky Mountain Laboratories sought to quantify the stability of H5N1 virus in raw milk when tested at different time intervals at 63\u2103 (145.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 72\u2103, the temperatures most common in commercial dairy pasteurization processes. The scientists isolated HPAI H5N1 from the lungs of a dead mountain lion in Montana. Then they mixed these viral isolates with raw, unpasteurized cow milk samples and heat-treated the milk at 63\u2103 and 72\u2103 for different periods of time. The samples were then cell-cultured and tested to determine if live virus remained and if so, how much.\n\nThey found that 63\u2103 caused a marked decrease (10-fold) in infectious H5N1 virus levels within 2.5 minutes and note that standard bulk pasteurization of 30 minutes would eliminate infectious virus. At 72\u2103, they observed a decrease (10-fold) in infectious virus within five seconds, however, very small amounts of infectious virus were detected after up to 20 seconds of heat treatment in one out of three samples. \"This finding indicates the potential for a relatively small but detectable quantity of H5N1 virus to remain infectious in milk after 15 seconds at 72\u2103 if the initial virus levels were sufficiently high,\" the authors note.\n\nThe scientists stress that their measurements reflect experimental conditions, should be replicated with direct measurement of infected milk in commercial pasteurization equipment and should not be used to draw any conclusions about the safety of the U.S. milk supply. Additionally, a limitation of their study was the use of raw milk samples spiked with H5N1 virus, whereas raw milk from cows infected with H5N1 influenza may have a different composition or contain cell-associated virus that may impact heat effects. The authors conclude that although gastrointestinal infections with HPAI H5N1 virus have occurred in several species of mammals, it remains unknown whether ingesting live H5N1 in raw milk could cause illness in people.\n\nTo date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concludes that the totality of evidence continues to indicate that the commercial milk supply is safe. While laboratory benchtop studies provide important, useful information, there are limitations that challenge inferences to real-world commercial processing and pasteurization. The FDA conducted an initial survey of 297 retail dairy products collected at retail locations in 17 states and represented products produced at 132 processing locations in 38 states. All of the samples were found to be negative for viable virus. These results underscore the opportunity to conduct additional studies that closely replicate real-world conditions. FDA, in partnership with USDA, is conducting pasteurization validation studies - including the use of a homogenizer and continuous flow pasteurizer. Additional results will be made available as soon as they are available.\n\nReference: \"Inactivation of Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus in Raw Milk at 63\u00b0C and 72\u00b0C\" by Franziska Kaiser, Dylan H.

With three cases reported in people in the United States and clusters from Michigan to Texas, it's clear that the virus is widespread among animals. To protect people, animals, and our economy, and to restore trust in public health, we need to get this right.\n\nWe've seen H5N1 coming for more than 20 years.

This story, along with a half-dozen other outbreaks that never made headlines, are featured in our new Epidemics That Didn't Happen report.\n\nFinland did three things well:\n\nRapid response. Within 24 hours of the first cases being reported on a mink farm, Finland confirmed that the animals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which was already known to be circulating among birds in Finland. Human and animal health officials worked together immediately to track infections, including testing at-risk people working on farms with infected animals.\n\nIn the United States, H5N1 has been spreading since at least late last year. Even today, the United States doesn't know the extent of spread among animals or humans due to insufficient testing and tracking. The 7-1-7 target for outbreak detection and response should be our guiding principle: 7 days to detect a suspected infectious disease outbreak, 1 day to notify public health authorities to start an investigation and 7 days to complete the initial response. This approach can halt outbreaks before they spread. Finland's response met this target. The first 7 in the US for H5N1 was more like 100 days. We have to improve the connection of human and animal health and strengthen animal public health measures.\n\nTrust. Farmers already had high trust in the Finnish Food Authority after years of successful programs and had launched a surveillance program that resulted in rapid notification of unusual symptoms among their animals. Farmers were reimbursed for the value of animals that needed to be culled to stop disease spread, strengthening trust in the government among the farming community. This trust will no doubt help Finland's next move: Vaccinating frontline workers against H5N1. They are the first country to do so.\n\nTrust toward the United States government is low, especially among rural Americans who are at the front line of these outbreaks. In May, in an effort to build trust with the farming community, the US Department of Agriculture announced financial incentives to farms to help stem spread in dairy cattle, including covering veterinary expenses for cattle testing positive for H5N1, compensating farms that supply personal protective equipment to their worker, and paying farm workers to participate in USDA and CDC studies. We may need to do more to protect our nation's agricultural sector.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture is ordering dairy producers to test cows that produce milk for infections from highly pathogenic avian influenza before animals are transported to a different state.\n\nJustin Sullivan/Getty Images/File\n\nCoordinated government response. Human health and agriculture officials in Finland coordinated closely, paving the way for a rapid, effective response. Joint responses strengthened detection, worked with industry groups, and protected workers from infection. Finland rapidly passed new legislation to ensure that its Food Authority had the mandate to implement effective control measures.\n\nIn the United States, government agencies have had rocky relationships given varying priorities, legal authorities, agility and politics. Coordination seems to be improving. Any directives from the government should be crafted to the specific needs of each community; national mandates will likely not be practical given our country's size and diversity.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWe have a lot to learn and no time to lose. First, states and national authorities must work with one another. This will require multiple federal agencies - including CDC, USDA, APHIS - and their state counterparts to share information transparently and in real time with each other and with the public. Second, Congress needs to provide resources to respond to the next pandemic and also for systems, workforce, and infrastructure so we are prepared to stop new and unknown events before they become epidemics. Third, and perhaps most importantly, we must quickly build relationships with farm owners and workers by being responsive to their needs and addressing questions and concerns.\n\nIf one country responds to H5N1 well, that's not enough. Microbes know no borders. Every country - including the United States - needs to mount an effective response.

It's believed the spread was the result of a \"spill-over\" event, possibly from wild birds, with an estimated 100,000 chickens at the property to be euthanised as a result.\n\nThere are now eight farms in total across Australia that have detected the deadly virus in its poultry flocks -- one in NSW and a seven in Victoria -- which is known to cause severe symptoms and even death in the birds. It's believed that 1 million chickens and ducks will be euthanised in Victoria alone as a result of the worsening outbreak.\n\nWhile that figure is confronting, in the US, where the spread is much more pronounced and has even begun to spread among dairy cows, a single farm was forced to kill a staggering four million chickens after an outbreak. Drone footage captured by the Mercy For Animals group at an Iowa factory egg farm has shown mountains of chicken corpses piled up as staff work to dispose of the bodies.\n\nIn the vision, dump trucks are seen pouring hundreds of thousands of dead chickens at once into massive piles, with feathers strewn across the property as workers bury the animals in rows. According to the group, the farm was home to 4.2 million egg-laying chickens, each subsequently destroyed.\n\nThe disturbing scenes highlight the crushing impact avian flu is having on farms across America, where an estimated 97 million birds have been affected since 2022, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). US officials announced earlier in June that a third person had tested positive with the virus -- a farm worker in Michigan who worked closely with sick cows.\n\nOn home soil, consumers have been told not to worry about eggs and poultry from the supermarkets with the outbreak not yet posing a risk to public health. Although the H5N1 potential pandemic strain remains the greatest threat to public health, the H7 variant can also spread to humans, as already seen in an infant returning from India to Melbourne earlier this month.\n\nSpeaking to Yahoo News Australia, Professor Enzo Palombo, food health and safety expert at Swinburne University, said \"there's no need to panic\" and \"no real sense that anything significant is happening locally which we should be concerned about\" for now.\n\nBut, there is growing evidence to suggest the virus \"could come across to humans more readily\", which \"could end up being the start of the next pandemic\". He said \"the real concern from a public health point of view\" will be if \"what's happening in the US with mammals\" occurs on home soil.\n\n\"What's most concerning is what's happening in the US with the dairy cattle, there have been documented transmissions from cattle to humans, most likely through milk,\" he said. \"The virus seems to be infecting the udders and it seems to be shared through milk, which tests showed had live virus in it.\"\n\nIf the virus moves from cows to infect pig populations, Palombo said, \"that scenario is much more frightening than any potential spread through food\" as \"pigs are notoriously the animals in which all these flu viruses tend to mix up and come out as new versions\".\n\nOn Australian farms, avian flu has so far only been detected among chickens and ducks.", "source": {"uri": "au.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!7 News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Victoria (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_euthanasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Animal euthanasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_for_Animals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercy for Animals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feather", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

More than one-third of the dairies' employees also work at another farm, according to the USDA report, increasing the risk for disease transmission.\n\nThe USDA survey is one of the first in-depth looks at how bird flu is moving through dairy farms across the country, with the department noting lapses in sanitation and biosecurity procedures that likely contributed to transmission.\n\nCattle transport, frequent farm visitors, plus shared equipment and labor appear to fuel transmission more so than the presence of wild birds, according to the survey. Although all farms noted the presence of some type of wild bird on their property, the USDA noted there is no \"genomic or epidemiologic evidence\" that these animals are spreading the virus.\n\nThe department also noted that other animals present on farms, like cats and poultry, may increase risk. Nearly all dairy farms that had poultry flocks noticed sick or dead birds. Of the farms with cats, more than 50% noticed animals die or become ill.\n\nIn Michigan, the state hardest hit by the ongoing dairy outbreak, epidemiologists found that most of the links between the dairies and poultry farms reporting cases are in the form of shared people, vehicles and equipment, according to a separate USDA report. While many of the biosecurity risks are unavoidable, they can be mitigated by increasing biosecurity practices and animal testing.\n\nTo advance research and help farms recover from the outbreak, Michigan's agriculture department is offering up to $28,000 per farm to work with federal and state government agencies to investigate how the virus got onto their operations.\n\nHowever, not all farms are taking the extra steps to monitor and prevent the disease from spreading. Despite federal funds being deployed, no farms have enrolled in voluntary on-site milk testing, Politico reported, with fewer than a dozen farms applying for financial aid in exchange for boosting biosecurity measures to contain the virus.\n\nKatelyn Jetelina, a public health expert and CDC advisor, wrote in a newsletter Thursday that if the H5N1 virus becomes more common in cows, it could become a constant presence in the U.S. and fuel industry disruptions similar to what the poultry sector is experiencing.\n\n\"We aren't doing the work to stop the virus,\" she said.\n\nMore than 100 cases in dairy cattle have been confirmed in 12 states since late March, according to an online tracker as of June 18. Three U.S. farm workers have contracted and recovered from the virus over the past three months.\n\nThe spread in cattle continues to raise concerns that the virus could mutate and infect humans. Former CDC Director Robert Redfield said in an interview with NewsNation that it's only a matter of time before bird flu transforms into a public health crisis with human-to-human transmission.", "source": {"uri": "fooddive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Food Dive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathan_owens@fooddive.com", "name": "Nathan Owens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biosecurity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epidemiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animal testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewsNation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NewsNation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Livestock", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Rural_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Rural Living", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/History", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/History", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.fooddive.com/imgproxy/nlPpjnaTMSZotVd7TkQAoEjYqKEhe-1kYw7dbe6udU4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTE0NjUzNzI5My5qcGc=.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2598, "textEnd": 2605}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Understanding the Potential Impact. - USA News", "body": "The potential impact of a bird-flu pandemic in humans is a cause for concern, as highlighted by the recent outbreak of the H5N1 virus in dairy cattle. While only three farmworkers in the United States have been affected so far, there is no guarantee that the virus will remain benign if it spreads among people.\n\nEvidence from the animal world suggests that the H5N1 virus can have severe consequences. Some dairy cows infected with the virus never recovered, leading to death or slaughter. Infected terns displayed disorientation and inability to fly, while elephant seal pups experienced breathing difficulties and tremors. Infected cats suffered from blindness and a high mortality rate.\n\nVirologist Anice Lowen from Emory University emphasized the need for caution, stating that H5N1 is a highly pathogenic influenza virus with the potential to cause significant harm to humans. In experiments with ferrets, the virus rapidly spread from the eyes to the airways, lungs, stomach, and brain, indicating its ability to cause systemic infections.\n\nThe implications of a potential bird-flu pandemic are grave, and vigilance is crucial in preventing the spread of the virus to humans. While vaccines and treatments are available, their efficacy against H5N1 may be limited. It is essential for public health authorities to closely monitor the situation and take proactive measures to contain any potential outbreak.\n\nThe global community must work together to prevent the emergence of a bird-flu pandemic in humans, as the consequences could be devastating.

The virus has been reported in 102 dairy herds across 12 states since late March, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Three dairy farm workers have also contracted the virus.\n\nMichigan's agriculture department will provide the grant money to up to 20 farms from its emergency response funds, Boring said. The goal is to help with losses associated with sick animals and to cover the costs of farmers and their staff working with scientists, he added. \"There are some real-time economic struggles these farms are facing,\" Boring said.\n\nThe funded farmers would need to work with the state agriculture department and USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's Veterinary Services (APHIS) to complete epidemiological investigations on their farms. They would also need to participate in other dairy herd studies related to the outbreak and bird flu research efforts by the state's Department of Health and Human Services, if applicable, the state agency said in a statement.\n\nBoring said the state has seen strong participation in testing from farmers with herd infections. The USDA in May said it would provide financial support for farmers who test their milk and cattle for the virus.

The risk that the virus poses is tempered by the fact that it doesn't spread easily among people -- yet.\n\nRight now public-health experts have the difficult task of urging authorities who can do something about H5N1 to take action, while maintaining public trust. Americans have just been through a pandemic that resulted in over one million U.S. lives lost. They may feel weary of more bad news or fear-based messaging. Communicating that while the threat level for most people is low, but if nothing is done it could become quite high, is not easy but is important.\n\nExperts need to be clear that currently, the levers of action are squarely in the hands of government leaders and agricultural interests, not in the hands of the general public. But public attention is key to ensuring that authorities find the will to act.\n\nNo one knows whether H5N1, if left unchecked, will become the deadly pandemic that public health experts like me worry it could. Many of us have been watching H5N1 with alarm for more than 20 years.\n\nAs an epidemiologist, I join those who are concerned that as H5N1 continues to infect animals and people exposed to them, it could become a greater threat. The virus could mutate to gain the ability to infect people more easily. Because we don't have immunity to this virus, a version that becomes highly contagious would likely cause a new pandemic.

The faster we can pick it up, the less risk there is of onwards spread,\" Dr Cooke said.\n\n\"The requirements in the controlled areas, especially the restricted areas, are to prevent onward movement of the virus either by vehicles, people or other means.\n\n\"Meredith has consistently been detecting [bird flu].\n\n\"The right thing to do is to stop the infected premises being any further risk, and that's the action that is taken through the humane destruction and disposal and the onwards cleansing and disinfection of the farms.\"\n\nAn egg farm near Terang was also found to have bird flu within its chicken population last month, however authorities found a different strain, H7N9.\n\nAgriculture Victoria is investigating the cause of the outbreaks but so far it is believed the disease has spread from wild birds into domestic poultry.\n\nThe state's outbreak of avian influenza has also spread to a commercial duck farm near Meredith.\n\nAustralian Duck Meat Association CEO Greg Parkinson said the farm represented about two per cent of Australia's commercial duck population and mostly supplied meat to restaurants, not supermarkets.\n\n\"It was not unexpected, it's a smallish duck farm -- about 40,000 birds -- and it was very close to the infected egg farms,\" he said.\n\n\"Ducks are kept in sheds precisely for these sorts of reasons -- we try to buffer ourselves from wild bird incursions and virus spillovers.\n\n\"About 30 million ducks are processed for meat per year.\"\n\nAustralia's duck meat industry is relatively concentrated and run by two main processors, Luv-a-Duck, which has about 30 farms in western Victoria, and Pepe's Ducks which runs out of New South Wales.\n\nThe infected duck farm does not supply either of these companies.\n\nThere are many types of bird flu, including the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, which has been detected in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, North America, South America and Antarctica.\n\nThis strain of the disease has spread beyond poultry, affecting various mammals including penguins, cattle and humans.\n\nThis strain has not been detected in Australian animals, however the nation recorded its first ever human case in March, when a child returned home from India with the disease.\n\nThe child has since recovered and authorities have confirmed there is no ongoing threat to the public.\n\nAustralia's response to eradicate avian influenza is in stark contrast to countries like the United States, where more than 96 million birds have been affected by the disease since an outbreak that began in 2022, according to the U.S Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAnyone who notices abnormal behaviour in their flocks, or unexplained deaths, is urged to contact the 24-hour Emergency Animal Disease Watch Hotline on 1800 675 888.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

To cope with this potential outbreak BirdCare Aotearoa needs support.\n\n\"Bird flu,\" is caused by the H5N1 virus, which has been wreaking havoc across Asia and Europe, and has recently been detected on Subantarctic islands and the Antarctic mainland. The worry is that the avian flu could potentially enter the country through migratory birds such as bar-tailed godwits and red knots, which travel from the north or from Antarctica, where the virus was detected earlier this year. The virus has a particular mutation, which appears to broaden its host species and geographic range. Further, internationally, ducks have proven to be a carrier for the disease, spreading it across different habitats and species.\n\nThe virus has shown devastating effects on wild bird populations globally and has even jumped to mammals, including cats, bears, and recently dairy cattle in Texas. Avian influenza primarily spreads among birds but can infect humans. While these viruses do not easily transmit from person to person, their presence in poultry poses concerns due to their potential to cause severe illness and mortality.\n\nLast year, BirdCare was on the verge of closure, but thanks to the community's generous support, they survived but the operation is still fragile. BirdCare will be at the ready if this disease arrives in T\u0101maki Makaurau and they need help spreading their wings! If we all flock together we can protect NZ birdlife.\n\nBirdCare is entirely funded by grants and donations, and unfortunately, they have not secured funding for this looming threat and need to raise $300,000 to cover the following;\n\nThis could be devastating, and help is needed to ensure that if you or your wh\u0101nau finds a bird in need, you have a place to bring it for expert, compassionate care.\n\n\"Together, let's continue to make a difference and keep our skies filled with beautiful birds\" say Carl Ashworth, General Manager of BirdCare Aotearoa.\n\nTo help save our Birds of Aotearoa please visit their website: https://birdcareaotearoa.org.nz/urgentappeal/", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subantarctic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subantarctic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_knot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red knot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-tailed_godwit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bar-tailed godwit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Habitat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortality rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

With three cases reported in people in the United States and clusters from Michigan to Texas, it's clear that the virus is widespread among animals. To protect people, animals, and our economy, and to restore trust in public health, we need to get this right.\n\nWe've seen H5N1 coming for more than 20 years. Finland stopped H5N1 in animals before it spread to humans last summer. This story, along with a half-dozen other outbreaks that never made headlines, are featured in our new Epidemics That Didn't Happen report.\n\nFinland did three things well:\n\nRapid response. Within 24 hours of the first cases being reported on a mink farm, Finland confirmed that the animals tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, which was already known to be circulating among birds in Finland. Human and animal health officials worked together immediately to track infections, including testing at-risk people working on farms with infected animals.\n\nIn the United States, H5N1 has been spreading since at least late last year. Even today, the United States doesn't know the extent of spread among animals or humans due to insufficient testing and tracking. The 7-1-7 target for outbreak detection and response should be our guiding principle: 7 days to detect a suspected infectious disease outbreak, 1 day to notify public health authorities to start an investigation and 7 days to complete the initial response. This approach can halt outbreaks before they spread. Finland's response met this target. The first 7 in the US for H5N1 was more like 100 days. We have to improve the connection of human and animal health and strengthen animal public health measures.\n\nTrust. Farmers already had high trust in the Finnish Food Authority after years of successful programs and had launched a surveillance program that resulted in rapid notification of unusual symptoms among their animals. Farmers were reimbursed for the value of animals that needed to be culled to stop disease spread, strengthening trust in the government among the farming community. This trust will no doubt help Finland's next move: Vaccinating frontline workers against H5N1. They are the first country to do so.\n\nTrust toward the United States government is low, especially among rural Americans who are at the front line of these outbreaks. In May, in an effort to build trust with the farming community, the US Department of Agriculture announced financial incentives to farms to help stem spread in dairy cattle, including covering veterinary expenses for cattle testing positive for H5N1, compensating farms that supply personal protective equipment to their worker, and paying farm workers to participate in USDA and CDC studies. We may need to do more to protect our nation's agricultural sector.\n\nCoordinated government response. Human health and agriculture officials in Finland coordinated closely, paving the way for a rapid, effective response. Joint responses strengthened detection, worked with industry groups, and protected workers from infection. Finland rapidly passed new legislation to ensure that its Food Authority had the mandate to implement effective control measures.\n\nIn the United States, government agencies have had rocky relationships given varying priorities, legal authorities, agility and politics. Coordination seems to be improving. Any directives from the government should be crafted to the specific needs of each community; national mandates will likely not be practical given our country's size and diversity.\n\nWe have a lot to learn and no time to lose. First, states and national authorities must work with one another. This will require multiple federal agencies - including CDC, USDA, APHIS - and their state counterparts to share information transparently and in real time with each other and with the public. Second, Congress needs to provide resources to respond to the next pandemic and also for systems, workforce, and infrastructure so we are prepared to stop new and unknown events before they become epidemics. Third, and perhaps most importantly, we must quickly build relationships with farm owners and workers by being responsive to their needs and addressing questions and concerns.\n\nIf one country responds to H5N1 well, that's not enough. Microbes know no borders. Every country - including the United States - needs to mount an effective response.

Fears of the rise of avian influenza H5N1 have been spiking recently, with some ringing the alarm about its ability to adapt to humans.\n\nDr Leonard Mermel, medical director of the Department of Epidemiology & Infection Prevention, Lifespan Healthcare System, wrote in the Providence Journal that, \"Cow udders contain cells with receptors used by the H5N1 virus to attach to the airways of

udder is a potential 'mixing vessel' whereby a mutation could lead to the H5N1 virus to preferentially bind to human cells.\"\n\nHe went on to warn that, \"Such potential puts us at the precipice of a pandemic that could mirror or surpass the 1918 influenza pandemic.\"\n\nHe added that avian influenza, \"would see a 40-fold increase in mortality compared to COVID-19\".\n\nWriting in the

This highly contagious viral disease poses a severe threat to poultry and dairy farms, with potentially devastating impacts on people, animals, and businesses.\n\nWhile avian influenza is not a new issue for the poultry sector, recent outbreaks have intensified concerns due to the virus's virulence and rapid spread among bird populations. Alarmingly, recent interspecies H5N1 cases have also been identified in more than 90 dairy herds and have infected humans, with one instance recently resulting in a fatality. The consequences of an outbreak can be catastrophic, leading to mass culling of birds, substantial economic losses for farmers, disruption of supply chains, and public health risks.\n\nThe current avian influenza outbreak presents a significant opportunity for TOMI to support its partners in mitigating risks and ensuring operational continuity. By providing advanced disinfection solutions, TOMI is positioned to not only assist in controlling the spread of bird flu but also to explore potential avenues for strategic growth. The Company's ongoing efforts in innovation and strategic partnerships are critical in addressing this global challenge and positioning TOMI for sustained growth in the food safety and agricultural sectors.\n\nIn response to this looming threat, industry stakeholders are increasingly adopting advanced disinfection technologies such as SteraMist to protect their facilities and control the spread of this lethal virus. The primary challenges during an avian influenza outbreak are the rapid transmission of the virus and its resilience in the environment. Contaminated environments and surfaces, close contact, and inhaling the virus from droplets or dust in the air can serve as reservoirs, facilitating its spread among birds.\n\nAs the industry braces for outbreaks, being prepared by implementing stringent biosecurity measures and cutting-edge disinfection methods is crucial to safeguarding animal health and ensuring business continuity. TOMI is readily equipped to deploy SteraMist to confront this looming threat and countless others spreading worldwide. We are leveraging our long-term, established partnerships to navigate this challenge and drive company growth. Our strategy of developing a global distribution network aligns precisely with the global nature of this threat. By working closely with our customers and distributors, we are not only reducing the threat of avian influenza but also capitalizing on the opportunity to expand our market reach and enhance our service offerings.\"\n\nDr. Halden Shane, CEO of TOMI\n\nTOMI Environmental Solutions", "source": {"uri": "news-medical.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "News-Medical.net"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disinfectant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Culling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virulence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veterinary medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biosecurity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://d2jx2rerrg6sh3.cloudfront.net/image-handler/picture/2014/7/Influenza-620x480.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-06-", "textStart": 467, "textEnd": 474}], "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Huffstutter and Leah Douglas\n\nJune 18, 2024 at 5:06 PM\n\nBy P.J. Huffstutter and Leah Douglas\n\nCHICAGO (Reuters) - Michigan will offer dairy operations with bird flu up to $28,000 to work with federal and state government agencies to investigate how the virus got onto their operations, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development Director Tim Boring said on Tuesday.\n\nFederal and state officials are researching several aspects of how bird flu spreads, including the possibility of respiratory spread among animals and prior infection of farm workers, in an attempt to curb further infection among animals and humans.\n\nThe virus has been reported in 102 dairy herds across 12 states since late March, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Three dairy farm workers have also contracted the virus.\n\nMichigan's agriculture department will provide the grant money to up to 20 farms from its emergency response funds, Boring said. The goal is to help with losses associated with sick animals and to cover the costs of farmers and their staff working with scientists, he added.\n\n\"There are some real-time economic struggles these farms are facing,\" Boring said.\n\nThe funded farmers would need to work with the state agriculture department and USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's Veterinary Services (APHIS) to complete epidemiological investigations on their farms.\n\nThey would also need to participate in other dairy herd studies related to the outbreak and bird flu research efforts by the state's Department of Health and Human Services, if applicable, the state agency said in a statement.\n\nBoring said the state has seen strong participation in testing from farmers with herd infections.\n\nThe USDA in May said it would provide financial support for farmers who test their milk and cattle for the virus. In a press briefing on June 13, federal officials said 11 farms had signed up for elements of the federal support program.\n\n(Reporting By P.J.

With India having faced countless significant outbreaks over the years in multiple parts of the country, explore the top 10 epidemics in India in the modern era.\n\nOriginating from Wuhan, China, and spreading worldwide, COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, emerged as a global pandemic and significantly impacted India. The nation experienced millions of infections and deaths, with the healthcare system being overwhelmed at times. Economic disruptions, lockdowns, and social distancing measures affected daily life and the economy.\n\n2. Avian Influenza (bird flu): 2019, 2024\n\nVarious strains, particularly H5N1 and H5N8, have caused multiple outbreaks of avian influenza, primarily affecting poultry but with occasional human infections. It led to significant culling of poultry to prevent the spread, economic losses in the poultry industry, and health risks associated with human infections. The WHO has also detected a case of human infection with bird flu, caused by the H9N2 virus, in a four-year-old in West Bengal, India. This is the second documented case in India, following the first reported case in 2019.\n\n3. Nipah virus: 2018\n\nThe Nipah virus is a zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted from animals to humans. The first recognised outbreak occurred in Malaysia, which also affected Singapore, where most human infections were linked to direct contact with sick pigs. In subsequent outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, it is thought that the consumption of fruits or fruit products contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats was the primary source of infection. There have been several outbreaks of this virus, the most recent one in 2018 in Kerala, leading to high mortality rates and significant public health concerns, as it had a high fatality rate of 40% to 75%, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), thereby causing severe respiratory infection and fatal encephalitis.\n\n4. Encephalitis: 2017\n\nA viral brain infection transmitted by mosquitoes, which particularly affects children, leads to severe neurological disease and has experienced recurring outbreaks in states like Uttar Pradesh (Gorakhpur in 2017) and Bihar (Muzaffarpur in 2019). There has been an increase in the number of cases where several children have died from encephalitis, specifically Japanese encephalitis (JE) and acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), primarily caused by mosquito bites, causing inflammation of the brain, resulting in long-term physical disabilities and, in some cases, death.\n\n5. H1N1 Influenza (swine flu): 2014-2015\n\n6. Dengue: 1996-Present\n\nDengue fever, or dengue shock syndrome, transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, first emerged in India in 1996, primarily in and around Delhi. The cause was confirmed as dengue virus type 2 through virus cultivation and indirect immunofluorescence with type-specific monoclonal antibodies, signalling a significant resurgence of dengue virus infection. Since then, the virus has continued to cause recurring outbreaks, particularly during monsoon seasons, with an estimated 100-400 million infections occurring annually (WHO). While many dengue infections are asymptomatic or produce only mild illness, the virus can occasionally lead to more severe cases and even death, highlighting the importance of continued public health efforts to combat this significant public health threat.\n\n7. Smallpox: 1974\n\nA highly contagious and deadly viral disease, smallpox, led to an average of 3 out of every 10 people who got it dying, as per the CDC. It was caused by two virus variants: Variola major and Variola minor. Smallpox has a history of occurring in outbreaks around the world, and it is not clear when it was first observed in India; however, in the early 1960s, 60% of all smallpox cases in the world were reported in India, and this strain of the virus appeared to be more contagious, according to the University of Michigan. As the World Health Organisation had begun laying plans for a mass campaign to eradicate smallpox around the world, it led to the official eradication in 1980, as confirmed by the WHO.\n\n8. Influenza (Hong Kong flu): 1968-1970\n\nA highly contagious and deadly flu caused by the H3N2 strain of influenza originated in Hong Kong in July 1968 and spread across the world, resulting in approximately 1 to 4 million deaths globally. Also known as the flu pandemic, it was descended from the A(H2N2) influenza virus that caused the Asian Flu pandemic.\n\n9. Cholera: 1961-1975\n\nVibrio cholerae, a type of bacterium, has caused seven cholera pandemics since 1817. In 1961, the El Tor strain of the Vibrio cholerae bacterium caused the seventh cholera pandemic when it emerged in Makassar, Indonesia. Within five years, the virus spread to other parts of Southeast Asia and South Asia, reaching Bangladesh in 1963 and India in 1964. In India, researchers have observed in academic papers that Kolkata's climate and location in the Gangetic Delta, along with poor water sanitation practices, make the city a hotbed for cholera, and this pandemic was no different.\n\n10. Spanish Flu: 1918-1920\n\nDuring the 1918 influenza pandemic, a deadly strain of avian influenza, also known as the Spanish flu, had a serious impact on India and other parts of the world. There are conflicting reports about the total number of deaths caused by this disease globally, but researchers estimate that the death toll was more than 50 million people. In India, it is believed that around 10-20 million people lost their lives due to the Spanish flu, which was brought to the region by Indian soldiers who were part of World War I. Records indicate that information about the dangers of the disease was disseminated through official government channels and word of mouth during the pandemic.\n\nThese epidemics have significantly influenced public health policies and practices in India, leading to enhanced surveillance, vaccination programmes, and overall improvements in healthcare infrastructure to better manage and prevent future outbreaks.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cherry_gupta@indianexpress.com", "name": "Cherry Gupta", "type":

It then goes on to state that every once in a while, \"a mutation occurs\" that changes the game, which is how a pandemic starts.\n\nHow that \"mutation occurs\" is not explained in the article, but Kawaoka and Horimoto are reportedly being paid by Gates to identify an early warning system the moment one does occur that could lead to a global outbreak and pandemic.", "source": {"uri": "sgtreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SGT Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_&_Melinda_Gates_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin\u2013Madison", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mammal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshihiro_Kawaoka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yoshihiro Kawaoka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airborne transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ferret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Receptor (biochemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basic reproduction number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biological agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_(medical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immunity (medical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decentralization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Gates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Malicious Software", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Organizations/Grant-Making_Foundations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Organizations/Grant-Making Foundations", "wgt": 12}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

While prices are around half that today, they have been climbing in recent weeks.\n\n\"USDA continues to work closely with state and industry partners on surveillance efforts to look for the virus and enact strong biosecurity measures to prevent its spread,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nWhen it comes to other dairy products, the International Dairy Foods Association told Newsweek that prices have actually been declining and bird flu had not impacted milk or dairy products at wholesale or retail levels.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_gooding@newsweek.com", "name": "Dan Gooding", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Naig", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Naig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Culling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H5N1", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H5N1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biosecurity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Eggs", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Eggs", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2413749/bird-flu-egg-prices-comp.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=c62ab5d7bae07670e54a84999ef8f563", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 3170, "textEnd": 3177}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

The actions taken now will determine whether the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 outbreak already affecting birds and mammals around the world takes hold in humans.\n\nWe've been watching the global spread of this new strain of H5N1 for roughly five years, from the time it first appeared in wild birds and literally flew around the world. We have seen it adapt and move into domestic poultry flocks, causing millions of chickens, turkeys and ducks to be destroyed to keep the virus at bay.\n\nInternational concern about the potential of this virus to cause a pandemic increased significantly in 2022, when the HPAI H5N1 was confirmed to have adapted and jumped to mammals like foxes, skunks, ferrets and seals.

Three dairy farm workers have also contracted the virus.\n\nMichigan's agriculture department will provide the grant money to up to 20 farms from its emergency response funds, Boring said. The goal is to help with losses associated with sick animals and to cover the costs of farmers and their staff working with scientists, he added.\n\n\"There are some real-time economic struggles these farms are facing,\" Boring said.\n\nThe funded farmers would need to work with the state agriculture department and USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service's Veterinary Services (APHIS) to complete epidemiological investigations on their farms.\n\nThey would also need to participate in other dairy herd studies related to the outbreak and bird flu research efforts by the state's Department of Health and Human Services, if applicable, the state agency said in a statement.\n\nBoring said the state has seen strong participation in testing from farmers with herd infections.\n\nThe USDA in May said it would provide financial support for farmers who test their milk and cattle for the virus.

Authorities adopted strict measures to control the virus, including quarantining two Victorian farms.\n\nDespite the avian influenza epidemic hitting farms in Victoria, no countrywide shortages of eggs or chicken meat have been recorded in Australia. Although some supermarkets, such as Coles, have placed purchase limitations in place as a safety precaution, there is still enough supply to fulfill demand across the country.\n\nThe latest bird flu outbreak has killed more animals than the statewide outbreak in Victoria in 2020, which included emus, turkeys, and chickens.\n\nApproximately 25% of Victoria's egg supply is produced in the Golden Plains Shire, one of the state's major egg and chicken meat-producing districts, where the present epidemic is mostly focused.\n\nA control zone, which includes six of the seven farms, found to have the H7N3 strain of avian influenza, runs around 100 kilometers from west to east in the area.\n\nAccording to Greg Parkinson, CEO of the Australian Duck Meat Association, the impacted duck farm near Meredith accounted for around 2% of the country's commercial duck population. He made it clear that restaurants, not supermarkets, were the farm's main customers for duck meat.\n\n\"The requirements in the controlled areas, especially the restricted areas, are to prevent onward movement of the virus either by vehicles, people, or other means. Meredith has consistently been detecting [bird flu]. If this virus was allowed to spread onward it would be devastating for the rest of the poultry industry in Victoria and perhaps onward through Australia.\"\n\n\"The right thing to do is to stop the infected premises from being any further risk, and that's the action that is taken through the humane destruction and disposal and the onward cleansing and disinfection of the farms,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shreyashi_chakraborty@ibtimes.com.au", "name": "Shreyashi Chakraborty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Victorian era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_outbreak", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disease outbreak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H7N3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H7N3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_A_virus_subtype_H7N9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Influenza A virus subtype H7N9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicken as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey (bird)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biosecurity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinfectant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinfectant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Rural_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Rural Living", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Birds", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Rural_Living/Hobby_Farms", "label": "dmoz/Home/Rural Living/Hobby Farms", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1662192/bird-flu-spreading-through-southern-france-highly-contagious-fowl-poses-no-health-risk-humans.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

(WOOD) -- Bird flu outbreaks among dairy herds in Ottawa County are not related to infected birds being disposed of at a nearby landfill, the county's top health official said.\n\nAdministrative Health Officer Adeline Hambley addressed concerns previously raised by Commissioner Allison Miedema at Tuesday's meeting with the Board of Commissioners' Health and Human Services committee.\n\nIn April, the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development announced an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian flu had been confirmed at Herbruck's Poultry Ranch in Ionia County. According to Hambley, the culling was so large that Herbruck's couldn't compost all of the remains on site and had to come up with another way to get rid of the infected bodies.\n\n\"For depopulation or culling all of these birds, they have pretty prescribed different processes for disposing of those carcasses,\" Hambley said. \"In this instance, water table, size, etc., they couldn't compost all of these birds. So they ended up landfilling.\"\n\nHambley also explained the process of how they are handled to prevent spreading the virus.\n\n\"It involves bagging the dead birds at the site. There is USDA monitoring on site for that part of the disposal. Then they get loaded onto trucks and transported to a landfill,\" she explained. \"They also monitor them at the landfill. Once they are dumped off, the bagged carcasses, they have to be immediately covered and then the trucks get sanitized at the site before they leave.\"\n\nThe first outbreak in Ottawa County came before the process for landfilling was complete and follow-up testing confirmed the two outbreaks are not related, Hambley said.\n\n\"Since then, they have done genome sequencing on both the birds that were disposed of and the cows and they are not genetically linked,\" Hambley said. \"They are not the same strains.\"\n\nCommissioner Joe Moss asked Hambley whether there is a way to prevent infected birds from outside the county being disposed of in Ottawa County. Hambley said the state has already decided that future landfilling will not be done there.\n\n\"(MDARD) is working closely with the Michigan Poultry Association. Their concern, the Poultry Association, is obviously how many turkey farms we have. My understanding is they will not be disposing in Ottawa County landfills because of that,\" Hambley said.\n\nSo far, Ottawa County has three confirmed HPAI outbreaks this year, two in dairy herds and one at a poultry farm.\n\nHPAI is a highly contagious virus that can spread from infected wild birds to other animals through an item exposed to the virus, like equipment, feed or even the clothes of the caretakers. In rare cases, humans can contract the virus.\n\nThe current HPAI outbreak, which sparked in February of 2022, has now affected more than 96 million birds nationwide, making it the worst outbreak of bird flu in American history. While HPAI is almost always fatal in birds, the mortality rate is considered low in cows.\n\nThose who suspect avian flu in their domestic animals are asked to call MDARD immediately at 800.292.3939 during the day or 517.373.0440 after hours.", "source": {"uri": "woodtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WOODTV.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_jaworowski@woodtv.com", "name": "Matt Jaworowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landfill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bird"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Culling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Avian influenza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compost", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Compost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carrion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_township", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil township"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poultry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dairy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionia_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ionia County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ionia County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whole genome sequencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_(bird)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey (bird)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poultry_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poultry farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cattle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/North America", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Europe", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Oceania", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Birding/Asia", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://www.woodtv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/51/2024/06/6667d245595115.33134247-e1718813260361.jpeg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9658552", "eventUri": "eng-9658552", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Welcome to Morning Agriculture! I'm your host Grace Yarrow. Send tips to [email protected] and follow us at @Morning_Ag.\n\nBIRD FLU CHECK-IN: Reliance on individual dairy farmers to help track the spread of avian flu is leaving the federal government without the data necessary to understand and slow the virus' spread, Meredith and David report.\n\nThe biggest challenge for the federal response, agriculture and public health officials told POLITICO, is that the more the virus spreads among dairy cows, the more opportunity it has to mutate and become easier to jump to additional humans.\n\nThe number of documented infected dairy herds in recent weeks has risen rapidly and several other states have confirmed initial infections in cows.\n\nThe challenge: Many dairy farmers are declining to test their cows, leaving the nation vulnerable to a situation in which federal officials won't have adequate warning if the virus evolves and poses a greater risk of infection to people.\n\nTo date, 94 herds across 12 states have tested positive for bird flu, but the testing has covered a mere fraction of the nation's nine million dairy cattle.\n\nMark Lyons, a senior USDA animal health official, said federal officials are \"still working closely to understand the breadth\" of the bird flu outbreak in the nation's dairy herds.\n\nSince April, more than 15,000 animal samples have been tested, with more than 4,300 under a federal order requiring dairy cow testing before animals are moved across state lines, according to USDA data.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL POV: Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) said she's paying \"a lot of attention\" to potential spread between species and to humans.\n\n\"This is a very interesting and complicated situation,\" Smith told MA in a brief interview, emphasizing that dairy products at the grocery store pose no health risk.\n\nLawmaker response: Smith said Minnesota state leaders have not identified \"any need for congressional action at this point, other than for us to be paying close attention and looking for ways to make sure that the federal and state actors are working well together.\"\n\nSmith, a member of the Senate Ag Committee, created the National Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program in the 2018 farm bill with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Smith's office confirmed that the program would be reauthorized under Stabenow's farm bill framework.\n\nCommunication is key: State leaders have told Smith that federal officials, including USDA, have been \"good partners\" in the avian influenza response.\n\n\"There have been occasions where the information flow from USDA federal to USDA at the state level could be improved,\" Smith said. \"USDA and CDC are working on building up their muscles for communicating across agencies in situations like this.\"\n\nWant to receive this newsletter every weekday?

That means she's not willing to come to the table,\" Thompson said. \"She needs to get with us.\"\n\nExtension talk: Stabenow said she'd be \"sitting down soon\" with ranking member John Boozman (R-Ark.) to find common ground on policies as the farm bill's deadline approaches.\n\n\"I would rather get a farm bill done if we can,\" Stabenow told us last week.\n\nAfter the release of his framework, Boozman said now's the time to hammer out a farm bill with Democrats or just \"agree to disagree\" and start working on an extension of the farm bill, which is set to expire at the end of September.\n\nFIRST IN MA: Elsewhere on the Hill, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) is introducing a bill today that would ban the intentional adding of animal excrement to animal feed.\n\nThat targets the practice of feeding chicken excrement, dead birds and feathers to cows. Booker is hoping to curb that amid the recent bird flu outbreak raising awareness of factory farming practices that could create a risk of spreading disease between animals and to humans.\n\n\"We must put an end to unsanitary factory farming practices that prioritize profits over public health, including the feeding of poultry litter to cattle,\" Booker said in a statement.\n\nHEAT PROTECTIONS: Last week, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration submitted a draft of a new standard to protect workers from heat-related harm while on the job to the White House's regulatory clearinghouse, as our Nick Niedzwiadek reported.\n\nPublic health experts, worker advocates and congressional Democrats have repeatedly pressed OSHA to act quicker on issuing a federal safety standard.\n\nAccording to the Labor Department, dozens of workers die annually and thousands more are injured due to extreme heat -- a threat that climate change is expected to worsen as temperatures rise and hot periods stretch longer.\n\nAgricultural workers are 35 times more likely to die from heat-related risks than workers in other industries.\n\nThere are \"a number of reasons\" -- beyond working outdoors -- that farm workers are especially vulnerable to heat risks, Jill Rosenthal, director of Public Health Policy at the Center for American Progress.\n\n\"Many farm workers are undocumented and may not be familiar with worker rights, and they may be fearful of speaking up when they feel like their health is at risk,\" Rosenthal said.\n\nIn the meantime: Because the federal rulemaking process can take years, states drafting and implementing their own heat protection standards can boost protections, said Alexis Guild, vice president of strategy and programs at Farmworker Justice.\n\nA handful of states already have heat standards for outdoor workers. She also encouraged the passage of a Democrat-led, bicameral bill that would require OSHA to put in place interim heat protections while they complete rulemaking through the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.\n\n\"We just certainly encourage OIRA to publish the proposed rule sooner rather than later,\" Guild said. \"The summer has begun. There are already heat events happening across the country. ... So the time is now.\"\n\n-- Ag Secretary Tom Vilsack is in Fort Collins, Colorado, today to announce a \"major investment in rural Coloradan communities\" with Rep. Yadira Caraveo (D-Colo.).", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Thompson_(politician)",

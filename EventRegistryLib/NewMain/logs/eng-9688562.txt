(CBS12) -- Palm Beach Zoo & Conservation Society is excited to welcome a new furry friend: Iyari, a ten-month-old female capybara!\n\nIyari the capybara came from the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, and can now be spotted greeting guests in the Tropics of the Americas section of the zoo.\n\nHer arrival is part of a collaborative effort, the zoo says. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA), an animal care and conservation organization, recommended Iyari's transfer through their Capybara Species Survival Plan (SSP). This program manages the capybara population across AZA facilities, ensuring genetic diversity that could potentially benefit wild populations in the future.\n\nThe ultimate goal? For Iyari and the resident male capybara, Zeus, to hit it off and contribute to the capybara population in human care. But for now, they're still getting to know each other.\n\n\"Iyari is a very sweet and inquisitive little capybara. We hope the excitement of Iyari's arrival contributes to the connections made between Zoo guests and the animals that live here,\" said Callie Carpenter, the Zoo's Associate Curator.\n\nSee also: KITTEN OVERLOAD: Palm Beach Co. Animal Care & Control seeks fosters for kittens\n\nCurrently, Iyari resides in a mixed-species habitat with Baird's tapirs, Spencer and Alyssa. You'll find them near the jaguar habitat, just after crossing the suspension bridge.\n\nCapybaras and tapirs share similar habitats in the wild, and the Palm Beach Zoo wanted to emulate the natural habitat. You can visit Iyari and offer her a warm welcome while also supporting wild capybara conservation efforts. The zoo contributes to vital protection programs in Brazil.\n\nYour visit to the Palm Beach Zoo, at 1301 Summit Boulevard, doesn't just brighten Iyari's day, it contributes to wildlife conservation!

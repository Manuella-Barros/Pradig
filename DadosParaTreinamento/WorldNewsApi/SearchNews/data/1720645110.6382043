For the 2024 Summer Games, NBC Sports has lined up a host of celebrities to bring star power to the 17-day event. During the opening ceremony on July 26, Kelly Clarkson, Peyton Manning, Today hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb and sports commentator Mike Tirico will be on the scene as thousands of athletes make their way down the River Seine on an unprecedented 4-mile-long flotilla made up of more than 90 boats. Among the names who\u2019ll provide coverage through the Games are NBA All-star Dwyane Wade (basketball), comedian Leslie Jones (who\u2019s been named \u201cchief super fan commentator\u201d), long-time commentator Mary Carillo, NBC talent including Willie Geist and Steve Kornacki, and Snoop Dogg, who recently said, \u201cI will be bringing that Snoop style to the mix.\u201d Alex Cooper, host and executive producer of the popular podcast Call Her Daddy, is also participating in the network\u2019s coverage. She\u2019ll host Watch With Alex Cooper, a series of live interactive watch parties on Peacock. The show will feature Cooper, yet-to-announced guests and friends sharing their thoughts and answering fan questions about live Olympic events including soccer, gymnastics and basketball. The aim is to add a communal viewing experience to the games. And at the closing ceremony (live on both NBC and Peacock) The Tonight Show\u2018s Jimmy Fallon will make his Olympic commentator debut, co-hosting along with Tirico, sports commentator Terry Gannon and Olympians Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski. \u201cNBC is really pulling out the stops to make this a really big event,\u201d says Chris Miller, the showrunner of The Tonight Show. Miller tells THR that Fallon, in addition to co-hosting the closing ceremony, will also \u201cshoot certain bits that will air within NBC during the Olympics.\u201d After the closing ceremony on Sunday, Aug. 11, The Tonight Show host will then fly right back to L.A. to tape his Monday episode. \u201cWe could have [aired] a repeat on that Monday,\u201d says Miller, but they decided that having Fallon open the show saying, \u201cI just got back hours ago from the Olympics\u201d would be \u201cgreat energy.\u201d Adds Miller, \u201cWe\u2019ll sleep later.\u201d Lipinski, for one, is already planning what she\u2019ll pack for her Paris sojourn: \u201cThis will be my fifth trip to an Olympics as a broadcaster with my partner in crime Johnny Weir. We love to match \u2014 we now have Terry Gannon in on the matching, too! \u2014 so we definitely do a little coordinating in advance, and with a Parisian theme this year, we are really going all out!\u201d A version of this story first appeared in the June 5 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

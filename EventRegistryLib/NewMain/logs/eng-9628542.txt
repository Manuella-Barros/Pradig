(AP) -- Abigail Castillo was about to cross the U.S. border illegally when she heard President Joe Biden was halting asylum. She continued anyway, walking hours through the mountains east of San Diego with her toddler son, hoping it wasn't too late.\n\n\"I heard that they were going to do it or were about to do it,\" Castillo, 35, said Wednesday as she and her son were escorted to a Border Patrol van with about two dozen others from Brazil, Ecuador and her village in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, which she said she left because it was gripped by violence.\n\nThey had missed the deadline, and were now subject to the new deportation rule.\n\nHer sense of uncertainty prevailed among many migrants after Biden invoked presidential powers to stop asylum processing when arrests for illegal crossings top 2,500 in a day. The measure took effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Wednesday because that threshold was met.\n\nTwo senior Homeland Security Department officials confirmed the first deportations under the new rule took place Wednesday, though they did not say how many were deported. The officials briefed reporters on condition their names not be used in keeping with regulations.\n\nSergio Franco, who clutched his baby girl after a nearly two-month journey from Ecuador with his family, walking through the perilous Darien jungle on the border between Colombia and Panama, said he was confident that he would prevail in his plea to find a safe haven in the United States.\n\n\"If we have evidence, there shouldn't be a problem,\" he said as he got into the van with Castillo and the others.\n\nAs the group was driven away, several migrants from India walked up to the same dusty area near a gun shop in the town of Dulzura, one of several that have popped up over the last year in the remote rural outskirts of San Diego for migrants to surrender to Border Patrol agents. There was no water or restrooms and little shade.\n\nSeveral Guatemalan women arrived later. Among them was Arelis Alonzo Lopez, who said she was nearly five months pregnant and had walked for two nights. A Border Patrol agent asked how she felt.\n\n\"I can't take any more,\" she answered.\n\nAsylum remains suspended until average daily arrests fall below 1,500 for a week straight. The last month that crossings were that low for that long was in July 2020, during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMigrants who express fear for their safety if they are deported will be screened by U.S. asylum officers but under a higher standard than what's currently in place. If they pass, they can remain to pursue other forms of humanitarian protection, including those laid out in the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nThere are serious questions about whether the new measure can stop large-scale migrant entries. Mexico has agreed to take back migrants who are not Mexican, but only limited numbers and nationalities. And the Biden administration doesn't have the money and diplomatic support it needs to deport migrants long distances, including to Ecuador and India.\n\nIn Matamoros, Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, Esmeralda Castro of El Salvador worried the asylum halt will drive more people to compete for the 1,450 slots awarded daily to enter legally through U.S. Customs and Border Protection's heavily oversubscribed online app, known as CBP One. Castro, 40, said she has tried for nine months for an appointment using the app.\n\n\"Imagine what's going to happen with what they've done. The system is going to collapse again,\" said Castro, speaking at a migrant camp near the banks of the Rio Grande where she has been living with about 10 others. The app has become so overwhelmed at times that users got error messages and experienced other technical failures.\n\nJuan Daniel Medina of the Dominican Republic said he was determined to stick with CBP One, even after eight months of fruitless attempts to get an appointment.\n\n\"It's the correct way because that way you do everything legally. They won't have to jump the river and risk facing criminal charges,\" the 30-year-old Medina said.\n\nTwo hours before the sun set Tuesday in San Diego, four busloads of migrants were dropped off by Border Patrol agents at a transit center, many of them to seek asylum in one of 68 immigration courts across the country. Asylum-seekers can generally work while their claims slowly wind through overwhelmed immigration courts.\n\nJesus Gomez of Medellin, Colombia, said Border Patrol agents told him he was one of the last people to be released to seek asylum and that he should tell friends and family back home that they will be deported if they attempt to enter illegally. He said he didn't know if it was true.\n\n\"It's a very difficult thing to navigate,\" Gomez, 49, said as he waited for his wife to be released by the Border Patrol before they fly to Boston, where their daughter lives.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

The measure took effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Wednesday because that threshold was met.\n\nTwo senior Homeland Security Department officials confirmed the first deportations under the new rule took place Wednesday, though they did not say how many were deported.

Mexico has agreed to take back migrants who are not Mexican, but only limited numbers and nationalities.

Gregory Bull/Associated Press\n\nDULZURA, Calif. -- Abigail Castillo was about to cross the U.S. border illegally when she heard President Biden was halting asylum. She continued anyway, walking hours through the mountains east of San Diego with her toddler son, hoping it wasn't too late.\n\n\"I heard that they were going to do it or were about to do it,\" Castillo, 35, said Wednesday as she and her son were escorted to a Border Patrol van with about two dozen others from Brazil, Ecuador and her village in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, which she said she left because it was gripped by violence.\n\nThey had missed the deadline, and were now subject to the new deportation rule.\n\nHer sense of uncertainty prevailed among many migrants after Biden invoked presidential powers to stop asylum processing when arrests for illegal crossings top 2,500 in a day. The measure took effect at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday because that threshold was met.\n\nTwo senior Homeland Security Department officials confirmed the first deportations under the new rule took place Wednesday, though they did not say how many were deported. The officials briefed reporters on condition their names not be used in keeping with regulations.\n\nSergio Franco, who clutched his baby girl after a nearly two-month journey from Ecuador with his family, walking through the perilous Darien jungle on the border between Colombia and Panama, said he was confident that he would prevail in his plea to find a safe haven in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"If we have evidence, there shouldn't be a problem,\" he said as he got into the van with Castillo and the others.\n\nAs the group was driven away, several migrants from India walked up to the same dusty area near a gun shop in the town of Dulzura, one of several that have popped up over the last year in the remote rural outskirts of San Diego for migrants to surrender to Border Patrol agents. There was no water or restrooms and little shade.\n\nSergio Franco, of Ecuador, holds his daughter as he waits to apply for asylum, Wednesday near Dulzura, Calif. Gregory Bull/Associated Press\n\nSeveral Guatemalan women arrived later. Among them was Arelis Alonzo Lopez, who said she was nearly five months pregnant and had walked for two nights.

The last month that crossings were that low for that long was in July 2020, during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMigrants who express fear for their safety if they are deported will be screened by U.S. asylum officers but under a higher standard than what's currently in place. If they pass, they can remain to pursue other forms of humanitarian protection, including those laid out in the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere are serious questions about whether the new measure can stop large-scale migrant entries. Mexico has agreed to take back migrants who are not Mexican, but only limited numbers and nationalities. And the Biden administration doesn't have the money and diplomatic support it needs to deport migrants long distances, including to Ecuador and India.\n\nIn Matamoros, Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, Esmeralda Castro of El Salvador worried the asylum halt will drive more people to compete for the 1,450 slots awarded daily to enter legally through U.S. Customs and Border Protection's heavily oversubscribed online app, known as CBP One. Castro, 40, said she has tried for nine months for an appointment using the app.\n\n\"Imagine what's going to happen with what they've done. The system is going to collapse again,\" said Castro, speaking at a migrant camp near the banks of the Rio Grande where she has been living with about 10 others. The app has become so overwhelmed at times that users got error messages and experienced other technical failures.\n\nJuan Daniel Medina of the Dominican Republic said he was determined to stick with CBP One, even after eight months of fruitless attempts to get an appointment.\n\n\"It's the correct way because that way you do everything legally. They won't have to jump the river and risk facing criminal charges,\" the 30-year-old Medina said.\n\nTwo hours before the sun set Tuesday in San Diego, four busloads of migrants were dropped off by Border Patrol agents at a transit center, many of them to seek asylum in one of 68 immigration courts across the country. Asylum-seekers can generally work while their claims slowly wind through overwhelmed immigration courts.\n\nJesus Gomez of Medellin, Colombia, said Border Patrol agents told him he was one of the last people to be released to seek asylum and that he should tell friends and family back home that they will be deported if they attempt to enter illegally. He said he didn't know if it was true.\n\n\"It's a very difficult thing to navigate,\" Gomez, 49, said as he waited for his wife to be released by the Border Patrol before they fly to Boston, where their daughter lives.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri":

President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled plans to enact immediate significant restrictions on migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border as the White House tries to neutralize immigration as a political liability ahead of the November elections.\n\nBy Valerie Gonzalez and Elliot Spagat, Associated Press\n\nWednesday, June 5, 2024 | 10:02 p.m.\n\nDULZURA, Calif. -- Abigail Castillo was about to cross the U.S. border illegally when she heard President Joe Biden was halting asylum. She continued anyway, walking hours through the mountains east of San Diego with her toddler son, hoping it wasn't too late.\n\n\"I heard that they were going to do it or were about to do it,\" Castillo, 35, said Wednesday as she and her son were escorted to a Border Patrol van with about two dozen others from Brazil, Ecuador and her village in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, which she said she left because it was gripped by violence.\n\nThey had missed the deadline, and were now subject to the new deportation rule.\n\nHer sense of uncertainty prevailed among many migrants after Biden invoked presidential powers to stop asylum processing when arrests for illegal crossings top 2,500 in a day. The measure took effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Wednesday because that threshold was met.\n\nTwo senior Homeland Security Department officials confirmed the first deportations under the new rule took place Wednesday, though they did not say how many were deported. The officials briefed reporters on condition their names not be used in keeping with regulations.\n\nSergio Franco, who clutched his baby girl after a nearly two-month journey from Ecuador with his family, walking through the perilous Darien jungle on the border between Colombia and Panama, said he was confident that he would prevail in his plea to find a safe haven in the United States.\n\n\"If we have evidence, there shouldn't be a problem,\" he said as he got into the van with Castillo and the others.\n\nAs the group was driven away, several migrants from India walked up to the same dusty area near a gun shop in the town of Dulzura, one of several that have popped up over the last year in the remote rural outskirts of San Diego for migrants to surrender to Border Patrol agents. There was no water or restrooms and little shade.\n\nSeveral Guatemalan women arrived later. Among them was Arelis Alonzo Lopez, who said she was nearly five months pregnant and had walked for two nights. A Border Patrol agent asked how she felt.\n\n\"I can't take any more,\" she answered.\n\nAsylum remains suspended until average daily arrests fall below 1,500 for a week straight. The last month that crossings were that low for that long was in July 2020, during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMigrants who express fear for their safety if they are deported will be screened by U.S. asylum officers but under a higher standard than what's currently in place. If they pass, they can remain to pursue other forms of humanitarian protection, including those laid out in the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nThere are serious questions about whether the new measure can stop large-scale migrant entries. Mexico has agreed to take back migrants who are not Mexican, but only limited numbers and nationalities. And the Biden administration doesn't have the money and diplomatic support it needs to deport migrants long distances, including to Ecuador and India.\n\nIn Matamoros, Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, Esmeralda Castro of El Salvador worried the asylum halt will drive more people to compete for the 1,450 slots awarded daily to enter legally through U.S. Customs and Border Protection's heavily oversubscribed online app, known as CBP One. Castro, 40, said she has tried for nine months for an appointment using the app.\n\n\"Imagine what's going to happen with what they've done. The system is going to collapse again,\" said Castro, speaking at a migrant camp near the banks of the Rio Grande where she has been living with about 10 others. The app has become so overwhelmed at times that users got error messages and experienced other technical failures.\n\nJuan Daniel Medina of the Dominican Republic said he was determined to stick with CBP One, even after eight months of fruitless attempts to get an appointment.\n\n\"It's the correct way because that way you do everything legally. They won't have to jump the river and risk facing criminal charges,\" the 30-year-old Medina said.\n\nTwo hours before the sun set Tuesday in San Diego, four busloads of migrants were dropped off by Border Patrol agents at a transit center, many of them to seek asylum in one of 68 immigration courts across the country. Asylum-seekers can generally work while their claims slowly wind through overwhelmed immigration courts.\n\nJesus Gomez of Medellin, Colombia, said Border Patrol agents told him he was one of the last people to be released to seek asylum and that he should tell friends and family back home that they will be deported if they attempt to enter illegally. He said he didn't know if it was true.\n\n\"It's a very difficult thing to navigate,\" Gomez, 49, said as he waited for his wife to be released by the Border Patrol before they fly to Boston, where their daughter lives.\n\n___\n\nGonzalez reported from Matamoros, Mexico.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Abigail Castillo was about to cross the U.S. border illegally when she heard President Joe Biden was halting asylum. She continued anyway, walking hours through the mountains east of San Diego with her toddler son, hoping it wasn't too late.\n\n\"I heard that they were going to do it or were about to do it,\" Castillo, 35, said Wednesday as she and her son were escorted to a Border Patrol van with about two dozen others from Brazil, Ecuador and her village in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, which she said she left because it was gripped by violence.\n\nThey had missed the deadline, and were now subject to the new deportation rule.\n\nHer sense of uncertainty prevailed among many migrants after Biden invoked presidential powers to stop asylum processing when arrests for illegal crossings top 2,500 in a day. The measure took effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Wednesday because that threshold was met.\n\nTwo senior Homeland Security Department officials confirmed the first deportations under the new rule took place Wednesday, though they did not say how many were deported. The officials briefed reporters on condition their names not be used in keeping with regulations.\n\nSergio Franco, who clutched his baby girl after a nearly two-month journey from Ecuador with his family, walking through the perilous Darien jungle on the border between Colombia and Panama, said he was confident that he would prevail in his plea to find a safe haven in the United States.\n\n\"If we have evidence, there shouldn't be a problem,\" he said as he got into the van with Castillo and the others.\n\nAs the group was driven away, several migrants from India walked up to the same dusty area near a gun shop in the town of Dulzura, one of several that have popped up over the last year in the remote rural outskirts of San Diego for migrants to surrender to Border Patrol agents. There was no water or restrooms and little shade.\n\nSeveral Guatemalan women arrived later. Among them was Arelis Alonzo Lopez, who said she was nearly five months pregnant and had walked for two nights. A Border Patrol agent asked how she felt.\n\n\"I can't take any more,\" she answered.\n\nAsylum remains suspended until average daily arrests fall below 1,500 for a week straight. The last month that crossings were that low for that long was in July 2020, during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMigrants who express fear for their safety if they are deported will be screened by U.S. asylum officers but under a higher standard than what's currently in place. If they pass, they can remain to pursue other forms of humanitarian protection, including those laid out in the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nThere are serious questions about whether the new measure can stop large-scale migrant entries. Mexico has agreed to take back migrants who are not Mexican, but only limited numbers and nationalities. And the Biden administration doesn't have the money and diplomatic support it needs to deport migrants long distances, including to Ecuador and India.\n\nIn Matamoros, Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, Esmeralda Castro of El Salvador worried the asylum halt will drive more people to compete for the 1,450 slots awarded daily to enter legally through U.S. Customs and Border Protection's heavily oversubscribed online app, known as CBP One. Castro, 40, said she has tried for nine months for an appointment using the app.\n\n\"Imagine what's going to happen with what they've done. The system is going to collapse again,\" said Castro, speaking at a migrant camp near the banks of the Rio Grande where she has been living with about 10 others. The app has become so overwhelmed at times that users got error messages and experienced other technical failures.\n\nJuan Daniel Medina of the Dominican Republic said he was determined to stick with CBP One, even after eight months of fruitless attempts to get an appointment.\n\n\"It's the correct way because that way you do everything legally. They won't have to jump the river and risk facing criminal charges,\" the 30-year-old Medina said.\n\nTwo hours before the sun set Tuesday in San Diego, four busloads of migrants were dropped off by Border Patrol agents at a transit center, many of them to seek asylum in one of 68 immigration courts across the country. Asylum-seekers can generally work while their claims slowly wind through overwhelmed immigration courts.\n\nJesus Gomez of Medellin, Colombia, said Border Patrol agents told him he was one of the last people to be released to seek asylum and that he should tell friends and family back home that they will be deported if they attempt to enter illegally. He said he didn't know if it was true.\n\n\"It's a very difficult thing to navigate,\" Gomez, 49, said as he waited for his wife to be released by the Border Patrol before they fly to Boston, where their daughter lives.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Since then, the Border Patrol has bused migrants to a trolley center and sent them on their way.\n\nMany have been turned away from crowded migrant shelters nearby. Dozens have ended up at the San Diego International Airport, where they have camped out at baggage claim for days at a time as they waited for flights to other destinations.\n\nNonprofit organizations have tried to fill the void by providing aid and transportation advice to migrants. But volunteers described a predicament for which government officials were unprepared -- and that nonprofits cannot adequately manage themselves.\n\n\"The situation is becoming more and more unrealistic,\" said Catalina Torres, 27, a volunteer for Al Otro Lado, a local nonprofit that has tried to help migrants at the drop-off spot in San Diego. \"I don't know how they expect us to keep doing this.\"\n\nIn April, 37,370 people crossed illegally in the San Diego sector and surrendered to the Border Patrol to claim asylum. The highest total that month in Texas was 30,393 at the El Paso sector. The Border Patrol divides the nation into 20 sectors by geography, and nine of them are on the border with Mexico.\n\nFacing intense political pressure to slow the surge in migration this election year, President Biden issued an executive order Tuesday that allows federal officials to block migrants and reject asylum protections once the seven-day national average for illegal crossings reaches 2,500 per day. The order is expected to face legal challenges, but it has the potential to stem the tide in San Diego and elsewhere if it is carried out as envisioned.\n\nSeveral factors have led to the growth in immigrant traffic in San Diego, immigration experts said. Among them: Smuggling networks have moved west as the areas in Mexico south of Arizona and Texas have become increasingly dangerous because of organized crime.\n\nAt the same time, Tijuana -- the largest city on the northern Mexican border, just across from San Diego -- has drawn an increasing number of migrants from around the world by bus or commercial air travel. In Mexico, a crackdown on immigrants from Central America has slowed migration into Texas, but it has had less of an effect on people reaching Tijuana, especially those arriving from overseas.\n\nIn the past, a vast majority of the people who crossed the southern border were from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, or El Salvador. In April, however, people who immigrated to San Diego came from 98 different countries -- including large groups from China, Brazil, and India -- in a surge in people fleeing conflict, climate change, authoritarianism, and post-pandemic economic hardship.\n\n\"The nationalities are like nothing we've ever seen in any sector anywhere before,\" said Adam Isacson, a program director at the Washington Office on Latin America, a research and advocacy organization.\n\nEfforts by Governor Greg Abbott of Texas to restrict immigration may also be having an impact, discouraging migrants from crossing there. Among those efforts is a new state law that allows state and local law enforcement officers to apprehend and expel immigrants living in the country illegally. While the law has been temporarily blocked, experts said that it might already have had a chilling effect. Republicans in Arizona are on the verge of asking voters to approve a similar law.\n\nCalifornia's political climate may be yet another reason migrants are heading to San Diego.\n\nMore immigrants than ever before are using social media apps such as TikTok, Facebook, or WhatsApp, experts said, where they can share the experiences they have had entering the country. That's what led Leidy Restrepo, 38, and her partner, Paula Arevalo, 31, to a shelter in San Diego.\n\nThey said they left their hometown, Ibagu\u00e9, Colombia, after enduring years of anti-LGBTQ+ harassment. Restrepo said that after she was assaulted by a group of men, she and Arevalo booked a vacation package to Tabasco, Mexico, and eventually flew to Tijuana, where they paid $1,500 each to smugglers to cross the border.\n\nThey were in touch with other LGBTQ+ immigrants on their journey north and chose to cross the border in California, Restrepo said, \"because the myth is that in San Diego, immigration welcomes you with better treatment.\"\n\nDuring the last federal fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, about 230,000 people crossed illegally into the United States near San Diego and surrendered to officers to claim asylum. In the first seven months of the current fiscal year, agents have already encountered more than 220,000 people. San Diego is on pace this year to surpass any annual total since the late 1990s.\n\nTorres, the nonprofit volunteer, said she fills out family reunification forms on her phone, confronts taxi drivers who try to fleece migrants, and de-escalates tense situations with \"anti-immigrant agitators\" who have harassed migrants and aid workers.\n\nShe was one of only two people who helped at the trolley hub on a recent morning.

(AP) -- Abigail Castillo was about to cross the U.S. border illegally when she heard President Joe Biden was halting asylum. She continued anyway, walking hours through the mountains east of San Diego with her toddler son, hoping it wasn't too late.\n\n\"I heard that they were going to do it or were about to do it,\" Castillo, 35, said Wednesday as she and her son were escorted to a Border Patrol van with about two dozen others from Brazil, Ecuador and her village in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, which she said she left because it was gripped by violence.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

The measure took effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Wednesday because that threshold was met.\n\nTwo senior Homeland Security Department officials confirmed the first deportations under the new rule took place Wednesday, though they did not say how many were deported. The officials briefed reporters on condition their names not be used in keeping with regulations.\n\nSergio Franco, who clutched his baby girl after a nearly two-month journey from Ecuador with his family, walking through the perilous Darien jungle on the border between Colombia and Panama, said he was confident that he would prevail in his plea to find a safe haven in the United States.\n\n\"If we have evidence, there shouldn't be a problem,\" he said as he got into the van with Castillo and the others.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAs the group was driven away, several migrants from India walked up to the same dusty area near a gun shop in the town of Dulzura, one of several that have popped up over the last year in the remote rural outskirts of San Diego for migrants to surrender to Border Patrol agents. There was no water or restrooms and little shade.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSeveral Guatemalan women arrived later. Among them was Arelis Alonzo Lopez, who said she was nearly five months pregnant and had walked for two nights. A Border Patrol agent asked how she felt.\n\n\"I can't take any more,\" she answered.\n\nAsylum remains suspended until average daily arrests fall below 1,500 for a week straight. The last month that crossings were that low for that long was in July 2020, during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMigrants who express fear for their safety if they are deported will be screened by U.S. asylum officers but under a higher standard than what's currently in place. If they pass, they can remain to pursue other forms of humanitarian protection, including those laid out in the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nThere are serious questions about whether the new measure can stop large-scale migrant entries. Mexico has agreed to take back migrants who are not Mexican, but only limited numbers and nationalities. And the Biden administration doesn't have the money and diplomatic support it needs to deport migrants long distances, including to Ecuador and India.\n\nIn Matamoros, Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, Esmeralda Castro of El Salvador worried the asylum halt will drive more people to compete for the 1,450 slots awarded daily to enter legally through U.S. Customs and Border Protection's heavily oversubscribed online app, known as CBP One. Castro, 40, said she has tried for nine months for an appointment using the app.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Imagine what's going to happen with what they've done. The system is going to collapse again,\" said Castro, speaking at a migrant camp near the banks of the Rio Grande where she has been living with about 10 others. The app has become so overwhelmed at times that users got error messages and experienced other technical failures.\n\nJuan Daniel Medina of the Dominican Republic said he was determined to stick with CBP One, even after eight months of fruitless attempts to get an appointment.\n\n\"It's the correct way because that way you do everything legally. They won't have to jump the river and risk facing criminal charges,\" the 30-year-old Medina said.\n\nTwo hours before the sun set Tuesday in San Diego, four busloads of migrants were dropped off by Border Patrol agents at a transit center, many of them to seek asylum in one of 68 immigration courts across the country. Asylum-seekers can generally work while their claims slowly wind through overwhelmed immigration courts.\n\nJesus Gomez of Medellin, Colombia, said Border Patrol agents told him he was one of the last people to be released to seek asylum and that he should tell friends and family back home that they will be deported if they attempt to enter illegally. He said he didn't know if it was true.\n\n\"It's a very difficult thing to navigate,\" Gomez, 49, said as he waited for his wife to be released by the Border Patrol before they fly to Boston, where their daughter lives.\n\n___\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nGonzalez reported from Matamoros, Mexico.", "source": {"uri": "thepeterboroughexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

After San Diego, the next highest number of migrant crossers in April came from the Tuscan Sector in Arizona, which reported 31,240 migrants. In the El Paso Sector in Texas, 30,410 migrants were reported.\n\nBy the end of fiscal 2023, which ended Sept. 30, nearly 230,000 people seeking asylum crossed illegally into the U.S. at the San Diego Sector. In the first seven months of fiscal 2024, Border Patrol agents counted 220,000 people. The sector is on pace to have the highest annual number of immigrants since the late 1990s.\n\nDue to the compounding pressures of the growing number of immigrants, a center in San Diego County focused on accommodating people who have crossed the border closed down in February. The center was operating on a $6 million budget, but now faith-based groups provided $150 million by the state will have to pick up the slack.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nMany of the churches and nonprofit organizations now tasked with helping the new arrivals are struggling to keep up with the influx. As a result, some migrants are bused by Border Patrol to a trolley hub or the airport and can spend days camped at baggage claim while awaiting a flight to their final destinations.\n\nTexas has worked to pass legislation that gives local and state law enforcement officers the authority to arrest and deport those who have crossed the border illegally. Currently, that law is being blocked, but it could have a chilling impact on the number of migrant crossings. The influx of migrants coming through San Diego may be attributed to prevalent organized crime in areas south of Arizona and Texas.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elaine_mallon@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Elaine Mallon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "El Paso, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "El Paso, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuscany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tuscany"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tuscany"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tram", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number_Theory", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Number Theory", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Walls", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Walls", "wgt": 11}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/AP24054678261419.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628542", "eventUri": "eng-9628542", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-30", "textStart": 482, "textEnd": 490}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - Abigail Castillo was about to cross the U.S. border illegally when she heard President Joe Biden was halting asylum. She continued anyway, walking hours through the mountains east of San Diego with her toddler son, hoping it wasn't too late.\n\n\"I heard that they were going to do it or were about to do it,\" Castillo, 35, said Wednesday as she and her son were escorted to a Border Patrol van with about two dozen others from Brazil, Ecuador and her village in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, which she said she left because it was gripped by violence.\n\nThey had missed the deadline, and were now subject to the new deportation rule.\n\nHer sense of uncertainty prevailed among many migrants after Biden invoked presidential powers to stop asylum processing when arrests for illegal crossings top 2,500 in a day. The measure took effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Wednesday because that threshold was met.\n\nTwo senior Homeland Security Department officials confirmed the first deportations under the new rule took place Wednesday, though they did not say how many were deported. The officials briefed reporters on condition their names not be used in keeping with regulations.\n\nSergio Franco, who clutched his baby girl after a nearly two-month journey from Ecuador with his family, walking through the perilous Darien jungle on the border between Colombia and Panama, said he was confident that he would prevail in his plea to find a safe haven in the United States.\n\nBorder Patrol agents talk with migrants seeking asylum as they prepare them for transportation to be processed, Wednesday, June 5, 2024, near Dulzura, Calif. President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled plans to enact immediate significant restrictions on migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border as the White House tries to neutralize immigration as a political liability ahead of the November elections. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull)\n\n\"If we have evidence, there shouldn't be a problem,\" he said as he got into the van with Castillo and the others.\n\nAs the group was driven away, several migrants from India walked up to the same dusty area near a gun shop in the town of Dulzura, one of several that have popped up over the last year in the remote rural outskirts of San Diego for migrants to surrender to Border Patrol agents. There was no water or restrooms and little shade.\n\nSeveral Guatemalan women arrived later. Among them was Arelis Alonzo Lopez, who said she was nearly five months pregnant and had walked for two nights. A Border Patrol agent asked how she felt.\n\n\"I can't take any more,\" she answered.\n\nAsylum remains suspended until average daily arrests fall below 1,500 for a week straight. The last month that crossings were that low for that long was in July 2020, during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMigrants who express fear for their safety if they are deported will be screened by U.S. asylum officers but under a higher standard than what\u00b4s currently in place. If they pass, they can remain to pursue other forms of humanitarian protection, including those laid out in the U.N. Convention Against Torture.\n\nThere are serious questions about whether the new measure can stop large-scale migrant entries. Mexico has agreed to take back migrants who are not Mexican, but only limited numbers and nationalities. And the Biden administration doesn\u00b4t have the money and diplomatic support it needs to deport migrants long distances, including to Ecuador and India.\n\nIn Matamoros, Mexico, across the border from Brownsville, Texas, Esmeralda Castro of El Salvador worried the asylum halt will drive more people to compete for the 1,450 slots awarded daily to enter legally through U.S. Customs and Border Protection's heavily oversubscribed online app, known as CBP One. Castro, 40, said she has tried for nine months for an appointment using the app.\n\n\"Imagine what\u00b4s going to happen with what they\u00b4ve done. The system is going to collapse again,\" said Castro, speaking at a migrant camp near the banks of the Rio Grande where she has been living with about 10 others. The app has become so overwhelmed at times that users got error messages and experienced other technical failures.\n\nJuan Daniel Medina of the Dominican Republic said he was determined to stick with CBP One, even after eight months of fruitless attempts to get an appointment.\n\n\"It\u00b4s the correct way because that way you do everything legally. They won\u00b4t have to jump the river and risk facing criminal charges,\" the 30-year-old Medina said.\n\nTwo hours before the sun set Tuesday in San Diego, four busloads of migrants were dropped off by Border Patrol agents at a transit center, many of them to seek asylum in one of 68 immigration courts across the country. Asylum-seekers can generally work while their claims slowly wind through overwhelmed immigration courts.\n\nJesus Gomez of Medellin, Colombia, said Border Patrol agents told him he was one of the last people to be released to seek asylum and that he should tell friends and family back home that they will be deported if they attempt to enter illegally. He said he didn't know if it was true.\n\n\"It's a very difficult thing to navigate,\" Gomez, 49, said as he waited for his wife to be released by the Border Patrol before they fly to Boston, where their daughter lives.\n\nGonzalez reported from Matamoros, Mexico.\n\nSergio Franco, of Ecuador, holds his daughter as he waits to apply for asylum, Wednesday, June 5, 2024, near Dulzura, Calif.

President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled plans to enact immediate significant restrictions on migrants seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border as the White House tries to neutralize immigration as a political liability ahead of the November elections.\n\nBy VALERIE GONZALEZ and ELLIOT SPAGAT - Associated Press\n\nDULZURA, Calif. (AP) -- Abigail Castillo was about to cross the U.S. border illegally when she heard President Joe Biden was halting asylum. She continued anyway, walking hours through the mountains east of San Diego with her toddler son, hoping it wasn't too late.\n\n\"I heard that they were going to do it or were about to do it,\" Castillo, 35, said Wednesday as she and her son were escorted to a Border Patrol van with about two dozen others from Brazil, Ecuador and her village in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, which she said she left because it was gripped by violence.\n\nThey had missed the deadline, and were now subject to the new deportation rule.\n\nHer sense of uncertainty prevailed among many migrants after Biden invoked presidential powers to stop asylum processing when arrests for illegal crossings top 2,500 in a day. The measure took effect at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Wednesday because that threshold was met.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The officials briefed reporters on condition their names not be used in keeping with regulations.\n\nSergio Franco, who clutched his baby girl after a nearly two-month journey from Ecuador with his family, walking through the perilous Darien jungle on the border between Colombia and Panama, said he was confident that he would prevail in his plea to find a safe haven in the United States.\n\n\"If we have evidence, there shouldn't be a problem,\" he said as he got into the van with Castillo and the others.\n\nAs the group was driven away, several migrants from India walked up to the same dusty area near a gun shop in the town of Dulzura, one of several that have popped up over the last year in the remote rural outskirts of San Diego for migrants to surrender to Border Patrol agents. There was no water or restrooms and little shade.\n\nSeveral Guatemalan women arrived later. Among them was Arelis Alonzo Lopez, who said she was nearly five months pregnant and had walked for two nights.

The southern border will be shut down until the daily average stays below 1,500 for at least a week, according to the White House.\n\n\"Today I'm announcing actions to bar migrants who cross our southern border unlawfully from receiving asylum,\" President Biden said at the June 4 press conference. \"Migrants will be restricted from receiving asylum at our southern border unless they seek it after entering through an established lawful process.\"\n\nAsylum will still be available to those who come to the United States legally by making an an appointment at a port of entry, but those \"who choose to come without permission and against the law\" will be restricted from receiving asylum and staying in the United States,\" he said.\n\nThis executive action, he said, will let the federal government \"gain control of our border\" and \"restore order to the process.\"\n\n\"For years, Biden has told the American public there is nothing he can do to secure the southern border and is now signing an executive order that will still allow thousands of illegal immigrants to enter the country every day,\" Mr. Desmond said in a June 3 statement.\n\nWord of the executive order came on the same day news broke that an illegal immigrant from Venezuela who shot two New York City police officers entered through Eagle Pass, Texas, last year, he said.\n\nHe also challenged President Biden to come to San Diego and \"see the more than 150,000 people who have been released on our streets,\" he said on X. \"The reality here in San Diego is dire, and the President's empty gestures do nothing to address the ongoing crisis. We need urgent, comprehensive action, not more political theater.\"\n\nEl Cajon Mayor Bill Wells, a Republican who is running for Congress, also panned the president over the border crisis and selecting supportive mayors from the Rio Grande regions of Texas, where illegal border crossings have recently decreased, for his press conference.\n\n\"In my area, we've got 1,500 to 2,000 a day coming across,\" he said.\n\nEl Cajon, a suburb less than 20 miles northeast of San Diego, receives about 50 illegal immigrants a day, but they are quickly transported to larger cities, Mr. Wells said.\n\n\"The [nongovernmental organizations] are still picking them up and sending them off to other cities,\" he said. \"There is such a secret coordinated effort to whisk people out of town to other undetermined places. I don't know where they're going. I don't know any more than anybody else does, but I can see on the news that places like Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York are being flooded.\"\n\nSharing Mr. Desmond's sentiments that Biden's order is \"just more political theater,\" he said: \"I have a feeling that there will be some sleight of hand and that they'll continue to leave the border wide open.\"\n\nAs of June 4, there were nearly 10,000 illegal immigrants in custody nationwide, including more than 2,600 in the San Diego sector, according to U.S. Border Patrol sources.\n\nWhile illegal immigrants seeking asylum surrender to the Border Patrol, the Mexican drug cartels are still smuggling others who don't give themselves up, Mr. Wells said.\n\n\"I don't think that's going to slow down whatsoever. I don't think the Biden administration has any intention of trying to counteract the cartels or to try to focus resources on protecting the border,\" he said.\n\nMr. Wells said he believes there is a coordinated effort to flood \"some of the bluer cities\" with illegal immigrants so that they will be granted more congressional seats based on population following the 2030 census.\n\n\"Everybody seems to be under the impression that the big concern is illegal aliens voting, and though I agree that is a concern, [they] don't even need that,\" he said. \"As long as you put the congressional seats in blue areas, it doesn't matter whether illegal aliens vote or not, they're going to take control.\"\n\nPresident Biden's executive order was \"nothing more than a photo op designed to fool the American people into thinking action is being taken,\" Mr. Wells said in a June 3 statement.\n\n\"The people of San Diego deserve real solutions, not empty gestures and false promises. We need effective and immediate action to manage the crisis at our border, ensuring the safety and security of our community,\" he said.\n\nThe executive action lacks a clear directive as to when or how Border Patrol agents are supposed to implement the order, he said.\n\n\"That's what's troubling,\" he said. \"I would love them to say that the 2,500 are going to be put on a plane and sent back to their country of origin. It didn't say that.\"\n\nIllegal border crossings near Jacumba, Calif., about 70 miles southeast of San Diego, were \"hit hard\" with more than 300 illegal migrants in the early morning of June 4, and another 200 crossed near Imperial Beach, Mr. Bayon said.\n\n\"It's just out of control,\" he said. \"We have agents that are aiding them [to get] further into the country because we're providing transport for them. We're told we've got to pick them up, take them to the migrant centers, and then we're providing buses to take them to the trolley stops and just release them knowing that they violated the law.\"\n\nWith close to 2,700 adults at the migrant processing center in San Diego on June 4, \"we were 99 percent over capacity,\" he said.\n\nOnly adults are counted in the daily totals, not the children of illegal immigrants, he pointed out.\n\n\"The American public needs to know that we can only hold them 72 hours and that's it. Then they're street released,\" Mr. Bayon said. \"So, what does that tell the world? 'Hey, come to America, and you'll be let in.'\"\n\n\"We're in a big election year, and this is the big deciding issue,\" he said.\n\n\"The campaign realized they had to do something about it, so they went down to Mexico and cut a deal,\" he said. \"They want the numbers down through November.\"\n\nBut exactly what kind of deal was struck remains a mystery, Mr. Bensman said.\n\nAnd although his tactics were called \"diplomatic blackmail\" by his critics, the Mexican president said if his demands weren't met, \"the flow of migrants will continue.\"\n\nMeanwhile, with 2,500 illegal migrants entering the country every day, some cities are on \"the verge of bankruptcy,\" Mr. Bensman said.\n\n\"It's still horrible,\" he said. \"For San Diego, it's terrible.\"\n\n\"They're pouring through San Diego but that's one spigot. It's probably the biggest spigot,\" he said. \"If they wanted to shut it down in California, they would, but they don't want to ... because the Mexicans have ceded that particular pipeline over to the cartels.\"\n\n\"I would even argue that they have arranged it in advance, to get sued on it so that they don't have to do anything that actually closes the border,\" he said. \"It's going to get tangled up immediately in that litigation, so that they won't have to use it, or they won't be able to use it.\"\n\nHowever, if the Biden administration had reimplemented former President Donald Trump's Remain in Mexico policies, it would have shown it is more serious about curbing illegal immigration, Mr. Bensman said.\n\nUnder the policy, individuals who crossed the southern border and asked for asylum, either illegally or legally at a port of entry, were given notices to appear in immigration court and sent back to Mexico and instructed to return to a specific port of entry at a specific date and time for their next court hearing,\" the immigration council stated on its website on Feb. 1, 2024.\n\nThe Biden administration, citing human rights violations and logistical problems, suspended and then terminated the program.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Workers with local aid groups said that they were unsure about how the new policy was being enforced, and the people waiting to be picked up by agents were largely unaware of the rules.\n\nIt was unclear if many of those being processed would be quickly sent back to their home countries, as called for in the new order.\n\nTwo Homeland Security officials declined to give preliminary numbers of migrants subject to the new policy on Wednesday but they cautioned that it's far too early to assess the impact. Border officials will begin to see the full strength of the policy in the coming days and weeks, a senior official told reporters. Its success will lie in whether overall border encounters drop and fast-tracked deportation numbers rise.\n\nInformed about Biden's order by a reporter, Montenegro said he would have tried to cross into the US regardless because he's desperate to provide for a wife and three children in Colombia. He thinks other migrants like him are unlikely to abandon their quest, since many are fleeing violence, extortion and poor economic conditions.\n\n\"There are no work opportunities for me back home, and I have to find a way to provide for my family,\" he said in Spanish. \"I left everything. It was the most difficult decision of my life to leave them.\"\n\nThe order announced this week effectively bars many asylum claims from those who cross the border between ports of entry -- such as by simply walking across. Under the new rules, asylum rights are mostly suspended for those people when levels are averaging above 2,500 encounters a day from Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, as they are now.\n\nUnder the new policy, US officials said removals would happen within hours or days in some cases. People who are from Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela are sent back to Mexico, under agreements that predate the changes; others are sent to their home countries, though officials acknowledge that's difficult in some cases.\n\nThe overwhelmed system means that the goodwill of the American public is \"wearing thin right now,\" Biden said Tuesday at the White House, in announcing the changes. \"I take these steps today not to walk away from who we are as Americans but to make sure we preserve who we are for future generations to come.\"\n\nPedro Rios, a local volunteer with the American Friends Service Committee, was handing out cups of hot soup when US agents arrived to take the migrants for processing. Despite the new order, the factors remain that are pushing migrants to leave their home countries, he said.\n\n\"The fact that there are this many people here means that they are still crossing,\" he said in an interview.\n\nIn the past, after processing, migrants who have been given a court date to plead their asylum case are typically released and dropped off at transit stations, where they must find a way to get to their next destination.\n\nChris Enow, 33, a volunteer for the nonprofit Al Otro Lado who helps migrants released by the government navigate their way to the airport or reunite with their family members, said about 300 people were waiting for assistance as of early Wednesday.\n\nOver the past six months, the San Diego border region saw a nearly 66% increase in border crossings from a year earlier, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The most recent numbers for the San Diego sector for the week through May 28 show that the agency apprehended 6,777 migrants from 67 countries, according to Chief Patrol Agent Patricia D. McGurk-Daniel.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score":

Why are we going to let 2,500 people cross illegally? That's like saying we will allow 2,500 car thefts before we do anything about it.\"\n\nBorder Patrol told Fox 260,000 migrants have crossed in to the San Diego border sector since October and 78% of those have been released into the US.\n\nBiden's proclamation was apparently designed to stem the tide of migrants flooding to the US, which has seen over 7 million arrested for crossing illegally since Biden came into office.\n\nMeanwhile, in Texas, the city of El Paso's migrant dashboard shows authorities currently have 1,500 migrants in Customs and Border Protection custody as of Wednesday morning, with 500 additional migrants encountered Tuesday -- representing a significant portion of the 2,500 number in Biden's order.\n\nIn Yuma. Arizona, mayor Douglas J. Nicholls told local news site AZfamily.com the area's facilities, which have the capacity to hold around 500 people, are completely full.\n\n\"We are assisting other sectors, so our facility is at 100% capacity,\" he said. \"If we got a surge of 1000, 1500 people, it could overwhelm and catch us... From a perspective of managing the whole system there are still some very high levels of concern.\"\n\nDespite Tuesday's order, many experts believe that the \"crackdown\" will make little difference.\n\nLillian Serrano, director of the Southern Border Communities Coalition, says that the migrants won't pay attention to Biden.\n\n\"We don't really expect any executive action to have an impact on the amount of migrants that arrive to our country,\" she told Border Report.\n\n\"They're not watching what the president does, they're driven by need and their plight.

Workers with local aid groups said that they were unsure about how the new policy was being enforced, and the people waiting to be picked up by agents were largely unaware of the rules.\n\nIt was unclear if many of those being processed would be quickly sent back to their home countries, as called for in the new order.\n\nTwo Homeland Security officials declined to give preliminary numbers of migrants subject to the new policy on Wednesday but they cautioned that it's far too early to assess the impact. Border officials will begin to see the full strength of the policy in the coming days and weeks, a senior official told reporters. Its success will lie in whether overall border encounters drop and fast-tracked deportation numbers rise.\n\nInformed about Biden's order by a reporter, Montenegro said he would have tried to cross into the US regardless because he's desperate to provide for a wife and three children in Colombia. He thinks other migrants like him are unlikely to abandon their quest, since many are fleeing violence, extortion and poor economic conditions.\n\n\"There are no work opportunities for me back home, and I have to find a way to provide for my family,\" he said in Spanish. \"I left everything. It was the most difficult decision of my life to leave them.\"\n\nThe order announced this week effectively bars many asylum claims from those who cross the border between ports of entry -- such as by simply walking across. Under the new rules, asylum rights are mostly suspended for those people when levels are averaging above 2,500 encounters a day from Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California, as they are now.\n\nUnder the new policy, US officials said removals would happen within hours or days in some cases. People who are from Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela are sent back to Mexico, under agreements that predate the changes; others are sent to their home countries, though officials acknowledge that's difficult in some cases.\n\nThe overwhelmed system-bsp-bb-link> means that the goodwill of the American public is \"wearing thin right now,\" Biden said Tuesday at the White House, in announcing the changes. \"I take these steps today not to walk away from who we are as Americans but to make sure we preserve who we are for future generations to come.\"\n\nRead More: Biden Says Trump Left Him 'No Choice' as He Moves to Seal Border-bsp-bb-link>\n\nAt the Texas border, the state Department of Public Safety said the agents it has deployed to the region were conducting patrols as normal. In the Del Rio sector, a hotbed for new arrivals at the end of last year, unlawful border crossings have plummeted this year as migrants have shifted to locations in Arizona and California.\n\n\"The Texas Department of Public Safety maintains a proactive posture and will continue to use every tool and strategy to deter unlawful border crossings,\" Lieutenant Christopher Olivarez, an agency spokesman, said in a message.\n\nOutside San Diego, Pedro Rios, a local volunteer with the American Friends Service Committee, was handing out cups of hot soup when US agents arrived to take the migrants for processing. Despite the new order, the factors remain that are pushing migrants to leave their home countries, he said.\n\n\"The fact that there are this many people here means that they are still crossing,\" he said in an interview.\n\nIn the past, after processing, migrants who have been given a court date to plead their asylum case are typically released and dropped off at transit stations, where they must find a way to get to their next destination.\n\nRead More: 10,000 Migrant Crossings a Day Upend the US Presidential Election-bsp-bb-link>\n\nChris Enow, 33, a volunteer for the nonprofit Al Otro Lado who helps migrants released by the government navigate their way to the airport or reunite with their family members, said about 300 people were waiting for assistance as of early Wednesday.\n\nOver the past six months, the San Diego border region saw a nearly 66% increase in border crossings from a year earlier, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The most recent numbers for the San Diego sector for the week through May 28 show that the agency apprehended 6,777 migrants from 67 countries, according to Chief Patrol Agent Patricia D. McGurk-Daniel.\n\n(Adds Texas law enforcement official's comment in 11th paragraph.)\n\n\u00a9 2024 Bloomberg L.P. All rights reserved.

Reuters reports varied nationalities among migrants. President Biden's administration faces criticism and enacts new asylum policies. Local residents and property managers witness increasing numbers of migrants crossing daily, emphasizing urgent humanitarian needs.\n\nBy Adrees Latif and Mary Milliken JACUMBA HOT SPRINGS, California, June 6 (Reuters) - P ropped up against the rusty steel slats of the border wall, migrant families who hours before crossed the U.S.-Mexico border rest under tarps and tents and await Border Patrol officers.\n\nSome of the families along this remote desert stretch in San Diego County have brought their children with them, including small infants. In recent months, the San Diego-Mexico border has become one of the busiest crossings for migrants seeking safe haven and opportunities in the United States.\n\nIn May, Reuters reporters came across Colombians, Ecuadoreans, Peruvians, Turks, Brazilians, Jordanians, Egyptians, Indians and Chinese - a more varied mix than the Mexicans and Central Americans who formed the bulk of migrants in years past. The high volume of crossings has ignited a political firestorm for President Joe Biden as the Democrat seeks re-election in November. And they have provided Republicans and their likely presidential candidate Donald Trump with plenty of ammunition to criticize Biden's immigration policy.\n\nThe Biden administration is hoping the numbers of migrants crossing will drop following the announcement this week of a broad asylum ban that would deny migrants caught crossing illegally the right to claim asylum. The Biden administration said high rates of border arrests has triggered the measures, which took effect immediately but include exceptions for unaccompanied children, people who face serious medical or safety threats and victims of trafficking.\n\nIn April, close to 30% of all the Border Patrol arrests across the U.S.-Mexico border were in the San Diego sector, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data showed. So far this fiscal year, which began in October, there have been more than 1.16 million migrant apprehensions border wide. The many Colombians here say their country has become too dangerous and they have received threats against their lives.\n\n\"There were threats towards me,\" said Edward, a 35-year-old teacher who asked that only his first name be used. \"Where we lived, there was lots of insecurity. And sadly, from February, they started threatening us and we decided to come here,\" he added.\n\nHe came with wife Luisa and their 11-month-old daughter and they hope they can make their way to New York. \"Yes, we were worried\" about traveling with such a small child,\" said Edward. \"But we were also thinking about the situation we were in.\"\n\nDown the fence, groups of migrants travel to a hilly, boulder-covered area where there is a break in the border fence. They clamber around the fence and then head off to areas where they will be picked up by Border Patrol. Kali Kai Braun, a 49-year-old property manager at a gun range that sits just inside the U.S. border, said large groups have started to come over in the middle of the night. He witnessed recently a group of 70 to 100 migrants crossing at 1 a.m. and stayed up to make sure they didn't go onto the property. He usually sees an average of 30 to 40 migrants a day, mostly crossing in the morning.\n\n\"It is truly insane what I have seen in the last year,\" Braun. WAITING IN HEAT AND SUN\n\nMost migrants walk to open-air sites, and in the afternoon, they are lined up and a Border Patrol agent takes pictures of their documents and faces and loads them into buses to take them to a processing center. Local resident Karen Parker, 61, brings water, snacks and medical supplies to waiting migrants. She was spurred to help them when a migrant woman was shouting in front of her house a year ago because she had lost her children.\n\n\"So I went looking for her kids and I found 1,000 people from all over the world,\" said Parker. \"She found her kids. It's a small town.\" Parker said last winter and summer, migrants would be waiting by the border fence for longer periods of time.\n\nJacumba Hot Springs in southeastern San Diego has long been a place of migrant arrivals, but residents witness what Parker calls \"hundreds of traumatized people every day.\" \"I would like to see our government, the Border Patrol take some responsibility and improve the conditions in this camp, the safety of the children and the families that are here in this area,\" said Parker.\n\nAnd she would like to see the transport operations pick up the children faster, so they don't have to wait in the heat and sun, without shelter and shade. A federal judge on April 3 ordered U.S. border agents to \"expeditiously process\" any children out of \"open air\" detention sites. The ruling came in the long-running, court-mandated agreement on the treatment of migrant children in federal custody, known as the Flores settlement.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to a request for comment. ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY BECKONS\n\nThree men from Jordan said they flew in through Nicaragua, now a hub for migrants heading towards the United States. They said it was hard to make ends meet in Jordan and they couldn't get married because they didn't make enough money. The trip from Nicaragua was hard and they were robbed in Honduras.\n\nOne of the men, who said his first name was Moath, graduated in 2017 and wanted to work in physical education. He could not find a job. \"My dream and my life, I want to come to America,\" said Moath, 33, who plans to head to Florida while his two fellow Jordanians are going to Chicago.\n\nOn some days, no migrants come over. Reuters observed how the Mexican military stopped migrants from crossing by setting up a patrol on their side of the fence. U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, the lead Democrat who negotiated a bipartisan border security bill that failed to pass in Congress, said a recent decrease in the number of border crossings was due to \"smart, effective diplomacy between the United States and the Mexican government.\"\n\nBiden implemented the new asylum policy after Trump pushed Republicans to vote against the legislative deal. Alejandro, a 50-year-old Colombian who had to flee after his father was killed and who is afraid to give his full name, hopes the American people will understand their plight.\n\n\"Those of us here in this foreign land we are equally human beings ... we feel pain and happiness. We hope we are received with warm human qualities and that we are treated like human beings,\" and then he added \"God made us all.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

Alongside others from Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico, she's now subject to new deportation rules. This reflects widespread anxiety among migrants as Biden's asylum suspension takes effect when illegal crossings exceed 2,500 daily.\n\nAbigail Castillo faced a grueling journey as she attempted to cross the US border, even after learning President Joe Biden had halted asylum processing. Along with her toddler, Castillo traversed the mountains east of San Diego, only to be met by Border Patrol agents enforcing Biden's new deportation rules.\n\nCastillo, 35, joined a group of migrants from Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico -- driven by violence at home but now caught in a policy shift after Biden invoked presidential powers to halt asylum when daily illegal crossings surpass 2,500. Despite their resolve, they had missed the deadline and faced deportation.\n\nThe scenario underscores the uncertainty plaguing migrants as they confront the new asylum suspension, which will continue until daily crossings fall below 1,500 for a week. The policy also imposes stricter standards for those claiming fear for their safety if deported. Meanwhile, logistical challenges and limited resources exacerbate the situation, raising questions about the measure's effectiveness in curbing large-scale migrant entries.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segundo_Castillo_(footballer,_born_1982)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Segundo Castillo (footballer, born 1982)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ecuador"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Border_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Border Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross_Country", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross Country", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Goalball/Torball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Goalball/Torball", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Crossdressing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_05_2024_13_45_14_5799874.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628542", "eventUri": "eng-9628542", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

{"id": 231959432, "title": "Think tech killed penmanship? Messy handwriting was a problem centuries before smartphones", "text": "Handwriting is dead. At least that\u2019s what a New York Times article announced in 2023 in its postmortem investigation \u201cWhat Killed Penmanship?\u201d But there was no doubt about the culprit: technology. You\u2019ve probably heard something like this before: the more time we spend using our phone screens and keyboards to type out everything from emails and texts to grocery lists to wedding speeches, the less we put pen to paper and the worse our handwriting gets. News articles over the past decade from the BBC, The Wall Street Journal and The Atlantic meditate on what we\u2019ve lost by relying on typing alone, from meaningful thank-you notes to the basic skill of writing legibly altogether. Even those who once took pride in their cursive penmanship might now find their own handwriting all but impossible to read. As one CNN headline damningly asked: \u201cHas Technology Ruined Handwriting?\u201d Articles like these imply that bad handwriting is a uniquely 21st-century condition, a symptom of our dependence on smart phones and laptops, one of the myriad ways our minds and bodies are being rewired by the ubiquitous technology that surrounds us. But as someone who studies the world of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, I\u2019ve found that bad handwriting is not a new phenomenon at all. Historical cacography In 16th- and 17th-century England, the vast majority of documents were produced by hand. Even after the spread of the printing press in Europe transformed how books were produced, people still used ink and quill pens to write out the letters, financial records, legal contracts, marginal annotations and scattered jottings on which daily lives depended. But even in an age when people frequently wrote by hand, messy and at times illegible handwriting was still a common problem. They even had a word for it: cacography, calligraphy\u2019s evil twin. In countless letters that survive from the early modern period, writers apologize for their bad handwriting. Sometimes they blame it on circumstances: they were groggy from just waking up or tired late at night (\u201cscribbled with a weary hand in my bed\u201d reads one sign-off from 1585). Sometimes the reasons were medical: a broken arm from falling off a horse, a hand injured in a duel or stiffening joints from the onset of arthritis or gout. Of course, a quickly dashed-off letter will always sacrifice elegance for speed. But some people seem to have had messy handwriting regardless of the circumstances. Robert Devereux, the Earl of Essex, one of the most influential courtiers in the age of Queen Elizabeth I, became notorious for his bad handwriting, which one contemporary said was \u201cas hard as any cipher to those that are not thoroughly acquainted therewith.\u201d The politician Sir John Glanville described his own handwriting as \u201cso bad that hardly anyone but his own clerk can read it.\u201d The brilliant Margaret Cavendish, author of the proto-science fiction masterpiece The Blazing World, said in the mid-1600s that she spent so much time writing quickly enough to get all her thoughts on paper that she lost the ability to write legibly altogether. \u201cMy ordinary handwriting is so bad,\u201d she observed, \u201cas few can read it.\u201d The Reformation theologian Martin Bucer allegedly couldn\u2019t even read some of his own manuscripts. Nor was he alone. As the preacher John Preston observed in a sermon, \u201cOne would think a man should read his own hand, yet some do write so bad, that they cannot read it when they have done.\u201d In an age when corresponding in one\u2019s own hand was an important gesture of intimacy, some self-conscious writers nevertheless found themselves depending on the services of professional copyists to make more legible transcripts of their letters. The Dutch humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus told one of his correspondents that he had used a scribe \u201cso as not to torture you with my cacography.\u201d Those who did receive cacographic letters might deeply resent being so tortured: Sir Philip Sidney, Roger Manners, and the Lord High Treasurer William Cecil all complained to Sir Robert Sidney about his \u201cevil\u201d handwriting. Too good to write well? Bad handwriting, it seems, is timeless. Yet, its social and cultural meanings can also be shaped by specific historical circumstances. In early modern England, for example, at a time of comparatively low literacy rates, the ability to write legibly required education and training. We might think then that elegant handwriting would have been seen as an index of social status. But the opposite could also be true: the aristocratic nobility were notoriously bad at writing by hand. Popular dramatists even made jokes about it. But bad handwriting may have been deliberate. In fact, Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet says just that: \u201cI once did hold it, as our statists do, A baseness to write fair, and labored much How to forget that learning\u201d That is, elegant handwriting was a tell-tale skill of the upwardly mobile, not those who were born into power and privilege. Writing carelessly could be a way of asserting one\u2019s social or political clout by forcing others less privileged to struggle to decipher what one had written. In other words, messy handwriting could be a power move. Today, the ubiquity of smart phones and laptops has no doubt played a role in the ways we write. But for those of us who can\u2019t read our own sticky notes and to-do lists, it may come as a relief to know that bad handwriting is not an unprecedented phenomenon, but has its own centuries-long history.

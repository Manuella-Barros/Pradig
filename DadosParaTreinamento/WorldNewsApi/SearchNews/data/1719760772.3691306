{"id": 225092516, "title": "From \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019 to \u2018Loot,\u2019 Maya Rudolph Never Takes the Easy Route", "text": "For consistent viewers of the show, there\u2019s a lot more to the bit\u2014particularly when it comes to Rudolph\u2019s work. For two seasons, she\u2019s traced the journey of ridiculously wealthy divorc\u00e9e Molly Wells, who has billions of dollars and an existential crisis on her hands\u2014ultimately deciding to find purpose by reengaging with her charitable foundation. The role has allowed Rudolph to play the character\u2019s most ridiculous and humane facets side-by-side, imbuing the show\u2019s clever 1% satire with a surprisingly empathic streak. This goes especially for the second season, which has solidified Loot\u2019s structure as a workplace comedy, and built toward Rudolph finding an ideal foil in Gasteyer\u2014a fellow newly single billionaire who approaches her next act in, well, more radical fashion. The shades Rudolph gets to play as Molly speaks to what she\u2019s shown onscreen since her SNL breakout. She\u2019s shined in independent films like Sam Mendes\u2019s Away We Go, won Emmys for her voice work on Big Mouth and her triumphant SNL return as Kamala Harris on Saturday Night Live. But in Loot, Rudolph gets a role to savor, one that allows her to go as broad and as nuanced as she likes, fine-tuning that balance with each episode. It platforms a pro in her prime. In conversation on this week\u2019s Little Gold Men (read or listen below), such a showcase naturally prods some career reflection too. Vanity Fair: This show feels like a prime example of what good sitcom-making is, by which I mean growing in its second season: the ensemble feels gelled, the sensibility feels more refined. Did you notice that too? Maya Rudolph: Absolutely. There\u2019s nothing more fun in the creation of a show than the second season, because you\u2019re really ticking a lot of boxes, especially in the pilot, to introduce everyone. But in the same way that my character Molly is getting a chance to really invest in her relationships now and understand and know the people that make up the Wells Foundation, so is the audience. We get to take everybody and play and make all the fun combinations. I love nothing more than a workplace comedy because it\u2019s just knowing people\u2019s voices. I would imagine that there\u2019s a lot of calibration that comes with that too, and figuring out the exact right tone. You were starting with a pretty high concept. How did that impact your own performance going into the second season? I think it was just a matter of finding the right tone for Molly. I knew where her heart was coming from. I knew she was a good person and had a good head on her shoulders, but was also capable of [being] completely out of touch. Those are really the places that I wanted to lean into the most, and I find them to be terribly fun to find a way to play together. But it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s hard to lean into that really arch comedy of being this woman who\u2019s just truly been living in her own hemisphere with somebody who really cares about other people. But the combination of those two things is what gives the show the ability to be relatable. Selfishly, I just tried to find the fun in that balance because I love playing both things. In some scenes you are the most ridiculous person in the room, and we love that. Then in others, you\u2019re with Adam Scott playing your unhinged tech-billionaire ex-husband. Well, I say this to his face and he knows that I feel this way\u2014he is the best douchebag there is. He\u2019s fantastic at it. God dammit. He\u2019s so good. And I mean, I think we quote \u201cDane Cook, pay-per-view, 20 minutes\u201d [from Step Brothers] constantly in my house. He\u2019s the greatest. As this airs, we are in the midst of your fabulous interplay with Ana Gasteyer, who is new to the show this season. You guys seem to be having a ton of fun together. We do. I mean, I feel like it\u2019s probably annoying for the people around us because we\u2019re chirpy. You have a scene where you\u2019re literally chirpy, doing this sort of businesswoman-cosplay dance. I mean, it does feel a bit written for us. [Laughs] It\u2019s that lovely luxury of the writers knowing her voice and her capabilities and mine and us together. She just completely nailed just the high and low of this poor woman. There was a moment where she\u2019s walking through her house and she realizes she\u2019s walking through broken glass and she\u2019s sort of surprised by it\u2014I chortled so many times, so much snot came out of my nose every time she did it. She\u2019s one of those performers that also just understands exactly what she\u2019s talking about and what she\u2019s ripping into. She\u2019s so smart and she\u2019s just so good at it. She nailed it. You have this really fantastic cast, too, of actors who are a little bit newer to the scene than Adam or Ana. I love your stuff with Joel Kim Booster, who plays your right-hand man. Being the lead of a show with that mix, how do you experience that? I\u2019d imagine some actors who are familiar with you may be just excited to work with you. Well, Joel just revealed last month something about me that he\u2019s been keeping very, very neatly hidden\u2014about his having seen me on SNL from the old days. I was really touched to hear that I\u2019d made it that far back into his consciousness. It keeps becoming a surprise for me to realize that I\u2019m the eldest in the group most of the time. I think once you turn 50, you realize you think everyone\u2019s the same age and they\u2019re not. \u201cWe\u2019re all in our 20s, right?\u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019re not.\u201d But I feel that way. It can be odd for people to look at me as that person. I don\u2019t totally recognize it. I\u2019m not mad at owning it, and I\u2019m getting better at it for sure. And it\u2019s been very lovely to experience it in this way on the show, because I definitely am that person for most of the people in the cast. I can\u2019t really tell how old anybody is anymore, so I feel like I\u2019ll make references to things\u2014we all have the same pop culture references, right? No. You don\u2019t know what Shasta Cola is or stuff like that. You poor, poor thing. You missed out on some good shit. My daughter\u2019s 10 and she said, \u201cMommy, I really wish I\u2019d been alive in the \u201890s. I feel like I really missed out.\u201d I thought it was so crazy to hear that, like, \u201cThe \u201890s, like, ew, what? Really?\u201d But then I realized, oh, she\u2019s totally right. I wanted to be in the \u201870s in that way. I mean, I was a baby, I was a little kid, but I get it. You couldn\u2019t be online, let alone weren\u2019t online. Thank God. I mean, God, how boring would I be? [Laughs] Thank God I didn\u2019t have any of that stuff. I really needed an outlet badly. I needed to get in people\u2019s faces and perform things live and annoy people with the sounds coming out of my mouth for a very long time. It really helped me develop as a person. I know you had performer parents, but where do you think that impulse came from, to get in people\u2019s faces? It\u2019s funny, we talk about it all the time too\u2014it\u2019s like, thank God I wasn\u2019t raised in Footloose territory. I was raised in a very creative household. The idea of being a performer or being creative was not foreign. As a matter of fact, it was celebrated. And I think what was so incredible about that kind of an upbringing is that you hear later when people are adults, maybe they didn\u2019t get the support that they needed at home. I got the most support to be the weirdest, the loudest, the craziest, trying things on\u2014all that stuff. I was just so incredibly supported and loved and seen. I do think that comes absolutely from my parents being artists and being raised by creative people. There\u2019s no question in my mind how much that influenced me. My favorite movie of yours is Away We Go, and I was thinking about that movie in connection to Loot\u2014because it\u2019s a really rich, dramatic role. It was the first movie you did right after SNL, right? Yeah, it was. I love that movie, and I feel the same way about it because it was such an exciting opportunity to get to flex that muscle. I remember after it came out, people were saying, \u201cI think people will be really surprised to see you in this way.\u201d And I remember thinking, \u201cWait, I always saw myself as doing this and Saturday Night Live and all of it. I never saw myself as any one thing.\u201d I can classify myself as a comedian, but I know starting out, I just thought acting was acting. I didn\u2019t really think of it as one particular thing. Coming out of a place like Saturday Night Live where people see you as a straight comedian, it was such an unbelievable opportunity to do something that I completely understood. It was the kind of movie that I loved and the kind of story that I wanted to see. To get the opportunity to be a part of that was extraordinary for me because we didn\u2019t always get those opportunities I had just had my first child and I had such similar experiences. I\u2019d never really read a script where the character was mixed, and that\u2019s not what the movie was about because that\u2019s so similar to my life. It\u2019s like, \u201cYes, I\u2019m mixed race, but that\u2019s not the headline\u2014and I also have good days and bad days and have a baby and have a boyfriend.\u201d All these things that just make you a person\u2026. I wish making every movie was like that. It was really, really one of those special ones. Coming out of that, did you feel a certain longing to just be in the indie film world from there? Oh, yeah. I kind of thought that\u2019s where I was going to end up. Before anything, I just thought, \u201cThat\u2019s my speed. Those are my people. That\u2019s where I\u2019m going to be.\u201d I never assumed differently. I was surprised that people were surprised to see me in the space, but I think that\u2019s because coming out of Saturday Night Live, people really saw me as one thing. I think it\u2019s changing and it\u2019s evolving, but it\u2019s still very slow. It\u2019s difficult for people to see you as what they don\u2019t know you as, and it\u2019s very comforting for people to see you as what they do know. I have no interest in that in life, and so I don\u2019t naturally follow that. And I\u2019m sure that is sort of wild and really crazy for some people. I\u2019ve never really wanted to experience a particular kind of material that was just going to be, for lack of a better word, straightforward. I don\u2019t present straightforward. I don\u2019t know what straightforward is for me and how that would manifest and maybe I will one day\u2026. I never thought I\u2019d be playing a vice presidential candidate on Saturday Night Live because when I worked there, there weren\u2019t any that looked like me. The world is fascinating in that respect, but it\u2019s nice to think about a project like [Away We Go]. You can\u2019t really create your career exactly the way you want it to be because you don\u2019t always get the parts you want and you don\u2019t always get the opportunities you want. But to think about where I wanted it to go and where it\u2019s gone is very interesting\u2014and some of the stuff I\u2019d like to get back to. I\u2019m biased because I grew up watching Saturday Night Live in your era, but your cast has always felt like a uniquely tight-knit group. And there\u2019s a meaningful lineage there to me, thinking about your time from there to Bridesmaids to even just seeing Ana on Loot. There\u2019s always a continuation. Yes. Even just hearing you say you grew up watching us\u2014I grew up watching them. The people that originated the show were our idols, and we were able to then bring that with us\u2014carry that with us into the work that we were doing and with a deep reverence, but also just an understanding of this lineage, what we were a part of. I think I\u2019m having an epiphany as we speak: It might be the missing puzzle piece of all these years when people have asked, \u201cWhy was this group of women so solid when you were there?\u201d I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, lightning in a bottle?\u201d We were raised differently, but we were all really good students, good daughters, good, strong, hard workers. But we all had this similar sensibility of growing up with the knowledge of what the show was, and having that respect and regard for the old guard and then being a part of the lineage of it, and being part of history. It all kind of just happened at that time.

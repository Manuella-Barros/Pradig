Why viral video has some fans thinking Chiefs QB is out of shape", "body": "The Chiefs are probably glad to see Patrick Mahomes back in the headlines after the front half of their offseason was dominated by negative storylines surrounding Rashee Rice and Harrison Butker. Mahomes might not be quite as thrilled.\n\nA simple video of Mahomes walking into the Chiefs' facility for OTAs on Tuesday caught the attention of some fans who were surprised by the two-time MVP's body.\n\nMahomes hasn't exactly had a model athletic body during his NFL career, but that doesn't matter if you're a quarterback who has won three Super Bowls in your first six seasons as a starter. Now, fans are wondering whether he's let himself go just a bit too much.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Mahomes' \"dad bod\" and how fans are reacting.\n\nMORE: Have Chiefs usurped Cowboys as 'America's Team'\n\nThe Chiefs tweeted a video of Mahomes walking into the facility for OTAs on Tuesday, with the caption \"QB1 is back on site.\" It's Mahomes' first football-related activity with the team since Kansas City's Super Bowl 58 win in February.\n\nWhile Mahomes' backpack likely didn't help his case, very clearly showing off his torso whether he liked it or not, the 28-year-old appeared to have a few extra pounds on him after the time away from the field.\n\nA few fans took note of Mahomes' \"dad bod,\" which made a superhuman athlete feel somewhat relatable for a moment.\n\nSome might see this as a right of passage for Mahomes. Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Ben Roethlisberger and Eli Manning are all quarterbacks with multiple Super Bowl wins this century who were often mocked for their \"dad bods\" and immobility under center. Mahomes has proven he's more mobile than each of those players, but it seems like just a matter of time before quarterbacks of his caliber start to look like the rest of us.\n\nThis is nothing new for Mahomes, who launched \"Dad Bod\" shirts in April as part of a partnership with Coors Light.

I'll also say I have a great body for a quarterback. You've got to have some padding in there to take the hits that we take.'\n\nMahomes has every right to claim that he has the perfect physique for a quarterback after leading the Chiefs to three Super Bowl victories and he works hard to stay in fighting shape for the NFL.\n\nPatrick Mahomes was seen arriving at the Chiefs' headquarters on Tuesday for OTAs\n\nRead More Patrick Mahomes says a 'Dad Bod' is great for a quarterback... but his rivals disagree as Lamar Jackson and Tua Tagovailoa shed weight in the offseason\n\nHe revealed in a 2018 interview with Men's Journal that he eats four to five meals a day and often has two dinners so he's not eating too much at one time.\n\nMahomes underwent a fitness overhaul in the summer of 2020, getting tested for allergies so he could calibrate his diet - which revealed he's allergic to 'most nuts' and grass - and hiring a personal chef, he told Men's Health in 2021.\n\nHowever, his self-proclaimed 'dad bod' may be the result of some guilty pleasures.\n\nThe quarterback has admitted he succumbs to a cheat meal every so often with Mahomes tucking in to chicken biscuits from Chick-Fil-A and burrito bowls in Chipotle, which were reportedly his most-ordered items in 2019 and 2018 on Postmates.\n\nHe also is known to order prime rib, barbecue and French fries from local establishments in Kansas City.\n\nAnd it doesn't stop there. Mahomes has also confessed to being a 'big snacker', reaching for the chips and candy, including Doritos, Jolly Rancher Gummies, or Starbursts, as late-night snacks.\n\n'I have to keep my body in shape, so no one tell my trainer this, or the Chiefs, but I'm a big snacker,' he told GQ Sports in 2023.\n\nThe signal caller's late-night snacking has been a source of teasing from his wife, Brittany.\n\nMahomes previously defended his 'Dad bod' amid criticism after the Chiefs' AFC title win\n\nThe 28-year-old quarterback was in Super Bowl-winning shape at the send of last season\n\nRead More Patrick Mahomes owns his 'Dad Bod' image by releasing hilarious Coors Light six-pack shirt for charity - after the Chiefs star joked his padded waistline is PERFECT for the NFL\n\nBrittany, a former professional soccer player, snitched on her husband earlier this year when she revealed that he eats 10 mini-ice cream cones a night.\n\n'Anyone else eat 10 of these a night... cause he does. Not me,' Brittany posted to Instagram in March with an arrow pointed toward Mahomes and a laughing emoji.\n\nMahomes' taste for ice cream also came up during an October episode of the 'New Heights' podcast, when teammate Travis Kelce, who has defended his own 'dad bod', and his older brother Jason Kelce discussed the quarterback's love of Dippin' Dots.\n\n'There is something weird with Dippin' Dots that it is only at amusement parks,' Jason Kelce said. 'Like where have you seen Dippin' Dots? I mean, I guess sporting events, I've seen some Dippin' Dots.'\n\n'I've seen them at Pat Mahomes' garage,' Travis responded. 'He's got a freezer of Dippin' Dots.'\n\nBrittany previously exposed his guilty pleasure by sharing that there is one specific snack that Mahomes munches on. In an Instagram story Q&A, a user asked Brittany what's a 'funny habit that Patrick has.' To which she responded, 'Eat Doritos every night in bed,' with a laughing emoji.\n\nMahomes' wife Brittany, a former professional soccer player, snitches on his snacking habits\n\nBrittany makes fun of her husband for his ability to eat 10 ice creams per evening\n\nRead More Brittany Mahomes pays tribute to 'hotttttt' husband Patrick amid dad-bod criticism... after Chiefs QB was named in TIME's 100 Most Influential People list\n\n'I always grab...a purple bag of Doritos, which I just got on. I used to be a Cool Ranch guy, but now I'm on the purple bag,' Mahomes previously told GQ Sports.\n\nMahomes also appears to have a penchant for fine dining too. Back in February, he led his friend's bachelor party of 20 to Carversteak at Resorts World, where they dined in the Whiskey Room, the private dining space at the luxury steakhouse, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.\n\nBut despite the digs at his physique, throughout the offseason, Mahomes has not rested on his laurels.\n\nAfter hoisting the Lombardi Trophy in February, Mahomes has spent the offseason working out with his longtime trainer Bobby Stroupe, focusing on 'pattern stability,' 'force absorption,' and 'force transmission'.\n\nStroupe shared an Instagram reel in March showing the Chiefs star in action, carrying out a fast-paced, high-intensity drills that challenge his strength, speed, power, responsiveness, and control.\n\nThe three-time Super Bowl winner also maintains a more regimented diet throughout the season to stay in championship-winning form.\n\nKansas City Chiefs dietician Leslie Bonci revealed, in an interview with Bet Kansas, that during a week of practice and gym sessions, the Super Bowl champions keep themselves ticking over with protein as well as salads and carbohydrates.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Bobby Stroupe (@stroupebob)\n\nRead More Patrick Mahomes shows off his 'dad-bod' in Mexico with wife Brittany - who recently revealed she has a fractured back - and their kids as the Chiefs Super Bowl hero enjoys well earned downtime with his family\n\n'It is normally fish and chicken for our team for meals during the week,' Bonci continued. 'Red meat comes in at a third but it's not just protein, there are Caesar salads, potatoes are a big one and also rice and pasta.\n\n'Salmon, swordfish, tuna, catfish, cod are those types of fish with texture rather than a squishy fish. Seafood is a big one too with shrimp and crab cakes. We try and be mindful of food waste though we don't want to be throwing away tins and tins of food.'\n\nThe nutritionist revealed that Kansas City stars usually demand breakfast foods such as French toast, waffles and pancakes before a game - even if they're playing in the evening.\n\nA lot of guys at the Chiefs love fish,' she said. 'BBQ food is right up there with burnt ends like brisket and the charred part as well as ribs but that's a meal in the middle of a week not on gameday.\n\n'I wouldn't say it's a superstition, but players are creatures of habit and there are some that like breakfast foods even if it's on a night game because that's their comfort food.\n\n'They want an egg sandwich, pancakes, waffle or French Toast. Not many of the players are eating an enormous amount of food before a game.\n\nThe quarterback has admitted he succumbs to a cheat meal every so often, including Chipotle\n\nHe also is known to order Chick-fil-A, prime rib, barbecue and French fries\n\n'We do have steak, pasta, chicken and sandwiches as well as French Toast and we have this abundance of food so players can come in and think 'what shall I eat'. What we don't want is players doing a U-turn and having a missed fueling opportunity so kudos to our executive chefs.\n\nBreakfast options, which are eaten before 8:30am, in that time include hot or cold cereal, eggs, omelets, sandwiches, potatoes or smoothies. Lunch is eaten between 12pm and 1pm, while options are also available after practice.\n\nOn two nights of every week Chiefs players are also offered the chance to have a dinner knocked up by Bonci and Co, which has plenty of benefits for both them and the team.\n\n'There's a lot of options from fillet to roasted salmon and grilled chicken or if they want pizza, there's a pizza oven,' Bonci said. 'They have the option, so they don't have to go out and eat, that way we know what they are eating which is better for us.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

The 28-year-old has never been \"ripped\" and is very comfortable with his physique, and he has even leveraged his build for charity.\n\nNevertheless, one fan on X wrote Mahomes \"got that offseason build,\" and another said he could \"really benefit from some cardio.\" A third described Mahomes as \"the least looking tough guy in the NFL,\" a perception the three-time Super Bowl MVP has spent several years putting to rest with his tough-as-nails postseason performances.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Butker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Butker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/769165c0688c751c1ee3681f58d4a962/crop/0x0/1978x1318/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/21/17163079976738.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588460", "eventUri": "eng-9588460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Coach Reid believes in respecting others' opinions following Butker's comments. Mahomes also addressed teammate Rashee Rice's recent legal issues.\n\nPatrick Mahomes spoke to the media at the Kansas City Chiefs' OTA practice today and gave his thoughts on Harrison Butker's recent speech at Benedictine College.\n\nButker of course, made headlines in the sports world last week after a commencement speech at the university in Atchison, KS. In his speech, he addressed female students in attendance and gave his thoughts on their futures after college, which did not sit well with certain groups.\n\nIt was inevitable that teammates and coaches would eventually have to address the story and, sure enough, Mahomes fielded questions regarding the Chiefs' kicker's speech. Mahomes noted that he didn't 'necessarily agree' with Butker's comments, but chooses to judge him based on 'the character he shows every single day'.\n\n... There's certain things that he said that I don't necessarily agree with, but I understand the person that he is, and he is trying to do whatever he can to lead people in the right direction.\n\nMahomes went on to elaborate more on his feelings on Butker and reiterated that while he doesn't necessarily agree with him, he praised Butker as a teammate and a human being.\n\nRelated Chiefs Continue Run of Bad Luck With Two O-Lineman Booked For Possession In the midst of the Rashee Rice legal issues, the Chiefs now have a pair of offensive linemen booked for marijuana possession. Mahomes and Butker Have Been Teammates For Seven Years Mahomes gave his thoughts on Butker as a teammate\n\nButker's speech included a statement intimating that the female graduates should be most excited about taking on the \"vocation of homemaker\", using his wife Isabelle as an example.\n\nMahomes chose to focus on Butker as his teammate, and the person he interacts with at practice and in the Chiefs' locker room.\n\nThat might not be the same values as I have, but at the same time, I'm going to judge him by the character that he shows every single day. That's a great person and we'll continue to move along and try to help build each other up to make ourselves better every single day. But at the end of the day, we're going to come together as a team and I think that'll help out as eliminating those distractions outside of the building as well.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: Harrison Butker's career FG percentage stands at 89.1 in the regular season and 88.9% in the playoffs.\n\nHead coach Andy Reid was also asked about Butker's comments and felt that he didn't need to address his comments, because everybody 'has their own opinions.'\n\nEverybody is from different areas, different religions, different races. And so, we all get along, we all respect each other's opinions -- and not necessarily do we go by those, but we respect everybody to have a voice. [That's the] great thing about America.\n\nMahomes Addresses Rashee Rice's Legal Troubles Second-year wide receiver is facing several felony charges\n\nMahomes spoke on other matters during his session with the media, including recent controversy surrounding second-year receiver Rashee Rice, who is facing eight felony charges for leaving the scene of a six-vehicle accident earlier this spring. Mahomes shared how he feels he and his teammates can help Rice.\n\n\"I think it's just trying to do whatever we can to teach him how to learn from his mistakes,\" Mahomes said. \"I mean obviously that was a big mistake, but you have to learn from it, make sure it doesn't happen again and try to do whatever you can to be the best person you can be in society, not only for yourself but for the people around you. And I think he is doing that, but right now we're just going to keep trying to do whatever we can to get him on the right path so that he can be a great football player obviously, but we want to be a great person, too.\"\n\nIt hasn't been an easy offseason for the Chiefs, as several players seem to be mired in controversy as the team is aiming to become the first three-peat Super Bowl champion.\n\nSource: ESPN\n\nAll stats courtesy of Pro Football Reference, unless noted otherwise.\n\nRelated Chiefs WR Participating in OTAs Amid Legal Concerns Kansas City Chiefs second-year WR Rashee Rice is facing eight charges involving an alleged hit-and-run crash in Dallas in March 2024.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Butker", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Butker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashee_Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rashee Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benedictine College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrestrial television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atchison,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atchison, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atchison, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Football-Reference.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro-Football-Reference.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mixcollage-01-apr-2024-05-54-pm-5176.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588460", "eventUri": "eng-9588460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Nevertheless, Mahomes has been seen all over the internet on vacations along with his good buddy/teammate Travis Kelce, which might have led him to not keeping a strict diet.\n\nListed at 6'2\" 225 pounds, Mahomes may have been eating a lot of his favorite food since winning the Super Bowl in February.\n\nWith all jokes aside, Mahomes may have some worry regarding pass-catchers this offseason, in particular, with the news breaking about one of his favorite targets, Rashee Rice, having a run-in with the law this season. That is, Rice may face suspension by the NFL, for he is being charged with vehicular aggravated assault and causing serious bodily harm, for his involvement in causing a six-car pileup crash on the highway at the end of March.\n\nMahomes may need to look for another route runner, considering Rice as a rookie, along with tight end Kelce, were the only real consistent receivers last year, but neither one of them eclipsed the 1,000 yard mark. With this in mind, in this year's draft, the Chiefs did trade up to select speedster wide receiver Xavier Worthy.\n\nThroughout his seven-year career (six full seasons), Mahomes has thrown for 28,424 yards, 219 touchdowns, and has a career 66.5% completion percentage, as well as a 103.5 passer rating.

In his speech, Butker advised the graduating female students to become \"homemakers.\"\n\nMahomes told reporters on Wednesday that Butker is \"a good person\", though he does disagree with some of the things that were said in the commencement speech, per TMZ:\n\n\"I know Harrison. I've known Harrison for seven years. I judge him by the character that he shows every single day and that's a good person...There's certain things that he said I don't necessarily agree with but I understand the person that he is. He's trying to do whatever he can to lead people in the right direction. Might not be the same values I have but at the same time, I'm going to judge him by the character that he shows every single day and that's a great person.\"\n\nAlso Read: NFL Fans All Noticed The Same Thing About Patrick Mahomes After Video Showed Him Arriving At Chiefs OTAs\n\nA petition at Change.org calls for the Chiefs to release Butker. It currently has 223,000 signatures and aims to reach 300,000.\n\nBased on the comments made by Patrick Mahomes and coach Reid, Butker's job as Kansas City's kicker is safe. The soon-to-be 29-year-old has spent his entire career with the Chiefs, which began in 2017.\n\nThe Georgia Tech product has won three Super Bowls with Kansas City, making game-winning field goals late in the 2022 AFC Championship Game and Super Bowl 57 vs. the Cincinnati Bengals and Philadelphia Eagles, respectively.\n\nKansas City will open its 2024 season with a home tilt against the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL Kickoff Game on Sept. 5.\n\nFans and followers of Mahomes know that he generally prefers not to discuss sensitive topics (unlike Aaron Rodgers, for example). The two-time league MVP surely knew that he would eventually have to address the comments, given the silence from Butker and the rest of the organization.\n\nMahomes made it clear that he disagreed with some of Butker's comments, but he also defended his teammate and was careful not to add any more fuel to the fire.\n\nAlso Read: VIDEO: Rival AFC Team Wickedly Trolled Kansas City Chiefs' Controversial Kicker Harrison Butker In Their Schedule Release", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoegler@totalprosports.com", "name": "Alex Hoegler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benedictine College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atchison,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atchison, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atchison, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Butker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Butker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_Tech", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Kickoff_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Kickoff Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Announcers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Announcers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/patrickmahomesharrisonbutker-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588460", "eventUri": "eng-9588460", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 420, "textEnd": 426}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-05", "textStart": 2052, "textEnd": 2059}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

And while the reigning champion Patrick Mahomes is all set for his training, his fitness is being critically questioned by fans. As a video of the 2x defending Super Bowl champion went viral, former linebacker Will Compton couldn't help but jump in on the discourse.\n\nAs Mahomes went viral for his physique going into the Chiefs facility for being \"severely out of shape after returning from the offseason,\" some fans also defended him in the comments. While some fans pointed out that he is clearly in normal off-season shape and has enough time to get back to a strong stature, Will Compton took the cake with the best reply as he said succinctly:\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum were football fans who were ready to name-call the QB and fat-shame him. They seemed to believe that his physique was 'severely' out of shape for a pro athlete. A lot of fans began to body shame the QB, mock him, and even question his commitment to the team:\n\nWhile Compton was very direct with how he felt about all the hate Mahomes was getting, the QB himself has made it clear in the past that the shape he is in, is in fact intentional. Mahomes has previously mentioned the advantages of his 'dad bod'.\n\nWhile QBs like Lamar Jackson and Tua Tagovailoa are going all out during the off-season to get shredded, Mahomes is content with his shape. Per the Daily Mail, he has made it clear that he thinks having a dad bod is good for a QB. He remains of the opinion that a little bit of fat on him has helped him get some padding for all the hits he has to take.\n\nMoreover, he has been one of the healthiest QBs in terms of injuries, so there is a high chance his logic makes sense.\n\nWhile he is continuously criticised by people for his physique, it is difficult to forget the image of a shirtless bulky Mahomes celebrating his third Super Bowl win.

He deliberately puts in plays that I have the opportunity to throw the ball behind the back. So, it's not it's not a coaching thing. It's me not having that confidence to do in in the game.\n\n\"But one of these games, man, we got to do it. There's been too much hype on it. We got to do it.

And you end it. That is what's important.\"\n\nThe case involving Rice, one of the breakout stars of last season, has been the biggest headache for Kansas City.\n\nThe 24-year-old faces one count of aggravated assault, one count of collision involving serious bodily injury and six counts of collision involving injury after he was accused of driving at speeds approaching 120 mph before a crash. The wreck in a speeding Lamborghini, which Rice has admitted to driving, involved six vehicles and resulted in multiple injuries.\n\nOne of his friends, Theodore Knox, was driving a Corvette involved in the wreck and faces the same charges. Both are accused of leaving the scene without providing information or determining whether anyone needed medical attention.\n\nEarlier this week, Dallas police said a separate situation apparently involving Rice had been resolved when a man signed an affidavit of non-prosecution over an incident at a downtown nightclub. The wide receiver reportedly had been accused of assaulting the man, though Rice was never identified by Dallas police in a report of the incident provided to The Associated Press.\n\nIn the meantime, Rice continues to practice with the Chiefs during their voluntary workout program.\n\n\"We'll just let the situation play its way out,\" Reid said.\n\nChiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was asked what advice he could provide Rice going forward, particularly with a legal case -- and likely NFL suspension -- hanging over his head and the start of the season less than four months away.\n\n\"It's trying to do whatever we can to teach him how to learn from his mistakes,\" Mahomes replied. \"Obviously, that was a big mistake. Learn from it and make sure it doesn't happen again, and do the best you can to be the best you can be for society and those around you. ... We're going to do what we can to get him on the right path to be a great football player, obviously, but we want him to be a great person, too.\"\n\nMahomes also said that while he doesn't necessarily agree with the comments that Butker made in his recent commencement address at Benedictine College, the Chiefs' star quarterback supports the kicker's right to make them.\n\nAmong other things, Butker said most women receiving degrees were probably more excited about getting married and having kids; argued some Catholic leaders were \"pushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America;\" referred to a \"deadly sin sort of pride that has a month dedicated to it\" in an oblique reference to Pride month; and took aim at President Joe Biden's policies, including his condemnation of the Supreme Court's reversal of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\n\n\"We're not always going to agree,\" Mahomes said, \"and there are certain things he said that I don't necessarily agree with.\"\n\nMahomes doesn't believe Butker's comments will be a problem in the locker room, though. Nor does he think that Rice's legal trouble will cause any sort of rift as the Chiefs chase their third straight Super Bowl title and fourth in six years.\n\n\"When you get in the locker room, it's a safe space where everyone can be themselves,\" Mahomes said. \"It's always good to have people here -- people in Kansas City, competing -- and then being as smart as we can when we're not in the building.\n\n\"I think guys understand we need to step up as a team and an organization,\" Mahomes added, \"but we need to go out there to prove it for other people to believe it as well.\"\n\nThe Chiefs would certainly do well to bond quickly. The NFL has presented them with a brutal schedule.\n\nAlong with playing on every day of the week but Tuesday -- including Christmas for the second year in a row -- the Chiefs will be done with their bye after Week 6 and later have a stretch in which they play three games in an 11-day span.\n\n\"Our schedule has gotten crazier and crazier every single year. We know we're going to have a lot of primetime games. We've built up a lot of equity to be in those games,\" Mahomes said, before adding with a wry smile: \"I know I'm going to try to be better on Christmas, because last Christmas was not great.\"", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Butker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Butker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Dallas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_College_(Illinois)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knox College (Illinois)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nightclub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benedictine College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bye (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

He's also a proud Texas native and Dallas Mavericks fan.\n\nSo when Mahomes stopped by \"First Things First\" on Wednesday, host Nick Wright invited the superstar Kansas City Chiefs quarterback to weigh in on Wright's NBA tiers, in which Wright compared the four remaining teams in the NBA playoffs to either the Chiefs or one of the teams they faced en route to one of Mahomes' four Super Bowl appearances.\n\nMahomes, however, pushed back on the final comparison, saying that this current Mavericks team, led by 25-year-old superstar Luka Doncic, reminds him more of a different Chiefs title team -- the 2019 squad.\n\n\"That [Chiefs] defense kind of came on at the end of the season and made a lot of timely stops in timely fashion, and that's what got us over the edge,\" Mahomes said. \"I was still young and hadn't won my first championship yet, and that could be Luka.\"\n\nThat prompted Wright to concede that, for the first time in the history of his tiers, he was wrong -- to the delight of his co-hosts, Kevin Wildes and Chris Broussard.\n\nMahomes said he loved the way the Mavericks gained athleticism at the trade deadline by acquiring P.J. Washington and Daniel Gafford to bolster their frontcourt. It's why, along with the star tandem of Doncic and Kyrie Irving, he believes the Mavericks can win it all this year.\n\n\"I think the Mavs have what it takes,\" Mahomes told the \"First Things First\" crew. \"Kyrie's playing great ball. Derrick Jones Jr. is playing great defense. P.J. Washington's been great on defense and offense. They did a lot of great things at the trade deadline -- I went to a game where they played the Nuggets right after the trade deadline, and you could see the athleticism they had brought in. I think if Luka plays the way that Luka can play and Kyrie plays like Kyrie, they've got as good a chance as anybody of winning it all.\"\n\nMahomes did concede that the Mavericks face a tough challenge against the Timberwolves in the Western Conference Finals -- even going as far to say Dallas would lose Game 1 of the series Wednesday night. (He did say he told his Chiefs teammates that he expected the Mavericks to have a 2-1 series lead when the Chiefs returned for their next round of offseason practices after Memorial Day.)\n\n\"It's gonna be a great series,\" Mahomes said. \"Anthony Edwards has been dominant. That team is a great team, plays great defense. It's gonna be a hard series.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Wildes_(priest)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Wildes (priest)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gafford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Gafford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Broussard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Broussard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Don\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luka Don\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Edwards_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Edwards (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Timberwolves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Timberwolves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Jones_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Jones Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1408/814/MahomesMavericks.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588460", "eventUri": "eng-9588460", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

And you end it. That is what's important.\"\n\nThe case involving Rice, one of the breakout stars of last season, has been the biggest headache for Kansas City.\n\nThe 24-year-old faces one count of aggravated assault, one count of collision involving serious bodily injury and six counts of collision involving injury after he was accused of driving at speeds approaching 120 mph before a crash. The wreck in a speeding Lamborghini, which Rice has admitted to driving, involved six vehicles and resulted in multiple injuries.\n\nOne of his friends, Theodore Knox, was driving a Corvette involved in the wreck and faces the same charges. Both are accused of leaving the scene without providing information or determining whether anyone needed medical attention.\n\nEarlier this week, Dallas police said a separate situation apparently involving Rice had been resolved when a man signed an affidavit of non-prosecution over an incident at a downtown nightclub. The wide receiver reportedly had been accused of assaulting the man, though Rice was never identified by Dallas police in a report of the incident provided to The Associated Press.\n\nIn the meantime, Rice continues to practice with the Chiefs during their voluntary workout program.\n\n\"We'll just let the situation play its way out,\" Reid said.\n\nChiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes was asked what advice he could provide Rice going forward, particularly with a legal case -- and likely NFL suspension -- hanging over his head and the start of the season less than four months away.\n\n\"It's trying to do whatever we can to teach him how to learn from his mistakes,\" Mahomes replied. \"Obviously, that was a big mistake. Learn from it and make sure it doesn't happen again, and do the best you can to be the best you can be for society and those around you. ... We're going to do what we can to get him on the right path to be a great football player, obviously, but we want him to be a great person, too.\"\n\nMahomes also said that while he doesn't necessarily agree with the comments that Butker made in his recent commencement address at Benedictine College, the Chiefs' star quarterback supports the kicker's right to make them.\n\nAmong other things, Butker said most women receiving degrees were probably more excited about getting married and having kids; argued some Catholic leaders were \"pushing dangerous gender ideologies onto the youth of America;\" referred to a \"deadly sin sort of pride that has a month dedicated to it\" in an oblique reference to Pride month; and took aim at President Joe Biden's policies, including his condemnation of the Supreme Court's reversal of the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.\n\n\"We're not always going to agree,\" Mahomes said, \"and there are certain things he said that I don't necessarily agree with.\"\n\nMahomes doesn't believe Butker's comments will be a problem in the locker room, though. Nor does he think that Rice's legal trouble will cause any sort of rift as the Chiefs chase their third straight Super Bowl title and fourth in six years.\n\n\"When you get in the locker room, it's a safe space where everyone can be themselves,\" Mahomes said. \"It's always good to have people here -- people in Kansas City, competing -- and then being as smart as we can when we're not in the building.\n\n\"I think guys understand we need to step up as a team and an organization,\" Mahomes added, \"but we need to go out there to prove it for other people to believe it as well.\"\n\nThe Chiefs would certainly do well to bond quickly. The NFL has presented them with a brutal schedule.\n\nAlong with playing on every day of the week but Tuesday -- including Christmas for the second year in a row -- the Chiefs will be done with their bye after Week 6 and later have a stretch in which they play three games in an 11-day span.\n\n\"Our schedule has gotten crazier and crazier every single year. We know we're going to have a lot of primetime games. We've built up a lot of equity to be in those games,\" Mahomes said, before adding with a wry smile: \"I know I'm going to try to be better on Christmas, because last Christmas was not great.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Butker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Butker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Dallas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knox_College_(Illinois)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knox College (Illinois)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nightclub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine_College", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benedictine College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bye_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bye (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports / Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nHis career hasn't even hit a decade yet, but Patrick Mahomes has seen and done just about everything possible thus far with the Kansas City Chiefs. There is one minor thing he might have left on his checklist, though, and it doesn't pertain to accolades for himself or his team.\n\nIt's a type of play. A throw, to be specific, that would take the football world by storm more than the 28-year-old has already done thus far. Mahomes has pulled off multiple no-look passes, as well as some shovel passes and left-handed tosses at critical moments.\n\nThe behind-the-back pass was teased early last August, although, it never made it to in-game action. Joining FS1's \"First Things First\" program on Wednesday afternoon, the two-time NFL MVP addressed the absence of that throw and left the door wide open for an appearance at some point soon.\n\n\"We didn't play as well, offensively enough, for me to pull the behind-the-back pass off this last year,\" Mahomes said. \"It's no one else's fault than myself, because Coach (Andy) Reid wants me to throw it behind the back more than anyone in the world. He deliberately puts in plays [where] I have the opportunity to throw the ball behind the back. So it's not a coaching thing, it's me not having that confidence to do it in the game. But one of these games, man, we've got to do it. There's been too much hype on it, we've got to do it, and hopefully it's to Travis (Kelce) because I feel like he's the best judging that behind-the-back pass.\"\n\nIt shouldn't surprise anyone that Reid, one of the most creative offensive minds ever, would give Mahomes the nod to attempt a behind-the-back pass. After all, the future Hall of Fame head coach is remarkably consistent in his messaging of not wanting to take away what makes Mahomes himself. There's a dynamic element to the superstar signal-caller's game that simply can't be taught, and it comes to the Chiefs' aid more often than not.\n\nMahomes and Kelce seem to function on the same exact wavelength, making the latter a prime target for such a throw (as Mahomes mentioned).

Now, fans are finally hearing from teammate Patrick Mahomes and coach Andy Reid regarding the address.\n\nMahomes and Reid both supported Butker's right to voice his opinion but took somewhat different approaches to the comments, which took a bold stance on the role of women in society and also targeted the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nButker encouraged female graduates at Benedictine College to consider taking on a role as a homemaker and argued that motherhood is more important than any professional career. He also referred to LGBTQ+ pride month as a \"deadly sins type of pride,\" which drew sharp criticism as well.\n\nOne reason Butker's comments gained so much attention was his reference to Taylor Swift as \"my teammate's girlfriend,\" which led fans of the pop star to start a petition for the Chiefs to release their Super Bowl-winning kicker.\n\nHere's what Mahomes and Reid had to say about Butker's comments Wednesday.\n\nMORE: Chiefs position battles to watch in OTAs and beyond\n\nReid voiced his support for Butker's right to speak his mind, telling reporters that Reid didn't feel he needed to address the comments with the team during OTAs.\n\n\"I didn't think I need to. We're a microcosm of our society. ... We all respect each other's opinions. We all have a voice,\" Reid said.\n\nThe 12th-year Chiefs coach hadn't spoken about Butker's comments until Wednesday, after Kansas City's offseason activities got underway earlier in the week.\n\n\"Everybody's got their own opinion, and that's what's great about this country,\" Reid continued.\n\nAsked what he would say if a woman working in the Chiefs facility approached him with concerns about Butker's comments, Reid reiterated that he strongly supports every member of the team's right to speak their mind. He also said he didn't believe Butker was \"speaking ill\" of women.\n\n\"Yeah, that hasn't happened.\" Reid said of women in the Chiefs facility approaching voicing concerns. \"I don't think he was speaking ill to women. He has his opinions, and we all respect that.\"\n\nMORE: Could Chiefs cut Rashee Rice amid tumultuous offseason?\n\nMahomes also supported Butker's right to share his opinions but made it clear that he disagreed with some of what his teammate said.\n\n\"I've known him for seven years.

Originally, the Texas Tech University student wanted to pursue baseball. \"My goal was to go to college, play three years of football, three years of baseball, and go [back] into the MLB draft,\" he told Time in April. Similar to Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Paul Skenes, Mahomes had a great GPA. In his freshman year at Texas Tech, Mahomes was named to the student athlete honor roll with a GPA of 4.0 as a baseball player in 2014. After one year of playing both sports, Texas Tech's football coach, Kliff Kingsbury, convinced Mahomes to focus on the gridiron.\n\nAs the team's starting quarterback, Mahomes exceeded all expectations. Even though he was the focal point of the Red Raiders' offense, Mahomes still maintained an impressive GPA of 3.91. Part of that was thanks to the work he put in while in high school. \"He started getting college credits at Tyler Junior College when he was still in high school,\" his mother, Randi Mahomes, told Tyler Today in 2015. \"I am very proud of his athletic achievements. However, I am more proud of his scholastic accomplishments,\" Randi said.\n\nThe following year, Patrick continued to make his mom proud as he was named the Big 12 Scholar-Athlete of the Year. He did that while achieving a 3.64 GPA as a marketing major.

During his 20-minute speech, Butker addressed female graduates in the audience about the \"most diabolical lies\" they have been told and using his wife, Isabelle Butker, as the example, intimated that the graduates should be most excited to take on the \"vocation\" of homemaker.\"\n\nMahomes said he did not \"necessarily agree with\" several comments made by his teammate of seven years but chose to \"judge him by the character that he shows every single day.\"\n\n\"... There's certain things that he said that I don't necessarily agree with, but I understand the person that he is and he is trying to do whatever he can to lead people in the right direction,\" Mahomes said. \"And that might not be the same values as I have, but at the same time, I'm going to judge him by the character that he shows every single day. That's a great person and we'll continue to move along and try to help build each other up to make ourselves better every single day. But at the end of the day, we're going to come together as a team and I think that'll help out as eliminating those distractions outside of the building as well.\"\n\nChiefs coach Andy Reid said he speaks with Butker \"all the time\" but did not feel the need to address the kicker's comments because \"everybody's got their own opinions.\"\n\n\"We're a microcosm of life,\" Reid said. \"Everybody is from different areas, different religions, different races. And so, we all get along, we all respect each other's opinions -- and not necessarily do we go by those, but we respect everybody to have a voice. [That's the] Great thing about America. And we're just, like I said, a microcosm of that, and my wish is that everybody could kind of follow that.\"\n\nRice, who has been present for Phase II of OTAs, practiced with the Chiefs on Wednesday.\n\nMahomes was asked how he and Chiefs players would help the second-year receiver as he faces legal consequences for his involvement in a multiple vehicle car crash in Dallas last month as well as a separate incident in an alleged May 6 assault at a Dallas nightclub.\n\n\"I think it's just trying to do whatever we can to teach him how to learn from his mistakes,\" Mahomes said. \"I mean obviously that was a big mistake, but you have to learn from it, make sure it doesn't happen again and try to do whatever you can to be the best person you can be in society, not only for yourself but for the people around you. And I think he is doing that, but right now we're just going to keep trying to do whatever we can to get him on the right path so that he can be a great football player obviously, but we want to be a great person, too.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placekicker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Placekicker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice_Owls_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rice Owls football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Butker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harrison Butker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictine_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benedictine College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0130%2Fr1284627_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588460", "eventUri": "eng-9588460", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 2424, "textEnd": 2429}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Mahomes said his goal is play better on December 25th, the team's matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\n\"I'm gonna try to be better on Christmas because last Christmas was not great,\" he said via the Chiefs' YouTube channel.\n\nMahomes' quip elicited a laugh from reporters but there's plenty of truth to those comments. Last Christmas, he had one of the worst games of his NFL career. In a 20-14 home loss to the Las Vegas Raiders, Mahomes went 27-of-44 for 235 yards, one touchdown and one interception. He was sacked four times. But even those numbers fail to tell the whole story. The Chiefs' offense painfully moved the ball, punting on their first three possessions and failing to pick up a first down that wasn't created by penalty.\n\nAfter finally putting together a touchdown drive in the second quarter, the Chiefs immediately went backwards. A botched Wild Cat exchange between Mahomes and RB Isiah Pacheco resulted in a fumble, Raiders' recovery, and touchdown. The next offensive play, he was pick-sixed by rookie CB Jack Jones, turning a 7-3 lead into a 17-7 deficit heading into halftime.\n\nThings didn't improve in the second half. Kansas City twice turned the ball over on downs in the third quarter and punted on their other possession. As the Raiders, who passed for only three first downs on the day, controlled the clock with the ground game, the Chiefs never found traction. A late Mahomes' touchdown made the game appear closer than it was but the Chiefs were handed a loss after entering the game was 10.5-point favorites.\n\nPittsburgh could be the gift Patrick Mahomes asks Santa for. He's schooled the Steelers in all three of their matchups, throwing a combined 14 touchdowns to just one interception with nearly 1,000 passing yards. He's beaten Pittsburgh on all three occasions, twice in blowout fashion.\n\nThe Steelers have the benefit of being the home team on a short week and are 2-0 on Christmas Day.

He plays a similar style of football that I do. I always watch what the Bills do and try to take from things that he does. I like watching C.J. Stroud a lot now. He's been out there, and he's making plays happen, and then I would say probably Joe [Burrow]. We play the same teams, and so watching him play definitely gives me some ideas of what we can do as an offense.\n\n\"The thing about the NFL now [is] there's a lot of great quarterbacks. I'm kind of the old guy now, and I have to kind of hold that title as the old guy, but I try to continue to do whatever I can to be the best that I can be.\"\n\nAllen, a two-time Pro Bowler, has wreaked havoc both as a passer and runner, throwing for 4,200 yards in each of the past four seasons, throwing for 30-plus touchdowns in three of the past four seasons and rushing for a career-high 15 touchdowns last season. Buffalo has won the AFC East in four consecutive seasons.\n\nStroud helped the Houston Texans win the AFC South and reach the AFC divisional round for the first time since 2019 last season as a mere rookie. Furthermore, Stroud won 2023 Offensive Rookie of the Year honors and cracked the AFC Pro Bowl Games roster, while posting a 100.8 passer rating in the regular season.\n\nBurrow's 2023 campaign was cut short due to a wrist injury, but he has amazed the NFL world for the better part of his four-year career. In 2021, he led the Cincinnati Bengals to the Super Bowl, and he helped get them back to the AFC Championship Game in 2022. Burrow threw for 4,400-plus yards and 34-plus touchdowns in both 2021 and 2022.\n\nMahomes and the Chiefs have faced off against Allen and the Bills three times over the past four years, coming out victorious each time. That said, Mahomes and the Chiefs have split with the Bengals in the playoffs, while the Bengals are a combined 3-2 against them (regular season plus postseason) since 2021.\n\nMahomes also detailed his favorite non-Super Bowl play of his career: a fourth-and-9 conversion at home against the Baltimore Ravens in 2018 where the Chiefs star completed a deep ball across his body, which helped the Chiefs go on to get a late-season win. Mahomes went on to reveal that Chiefs head coach Andy Reid has been trying to get him to complete a behind-the-back pass in a game.\n\nMahomes is a two-time NFL MVP and six-time Pro Bowler.

Green.\n\n\"When you're in the locker, there's a lot of people from a lot of different areas of life, and they have a lot of different views on everything. And we're not always going to agree. He said certain things I don't agree with.\" The three-time Super Bowl MVP declined to share what specific comments he disagreed with most, The Athletic's Nate Taylor posted.\n\n\"That's his views.., it's about us, taking the man and his values and everything that he does every single day and then judging him by that and not by one moment or one speech.\"\n\nMahomes and Butker have been teammates since the Chiefs first since they both joined the Chiefs in 2017. Chiefs head coach Andy Reid shared his view of Butker's speech earlier in the day.\n\nButker told the graduating class at the small Catholic school on May 11, \"I think it is you, the women, who have had the most diabolic lies told to you. Some of you may go on to lead successful careers in the world, but I would venture to guess that the majority of you are most excited about your marriage and the children you will bring into this world.\n\n\"I can tell you that my beautiful wife, Isabelle, would be the first to say her life truly started when she started living her vocation as a wife and as a mother,\" he said. \"It cannot be overstated that all my success is made possible because a girl I met in band class back in middle school would convert to the faith, become my wife and embrace one of the most important titles of all: homemaker.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old kicker also denounced abortion, IVF, surrogacy, euthanasia, Jews, Pride Month, President Joe Biden, and pro-choice Catholics.\n\nThe Benedictine Sisters of Mount St. Scholastica denounced Butker's speech in a statement, particularly the \"homemaker\" claim. While Butker's speech received full support from the Chiefs co-owner Clark Hunt's wife and daughter, Tavia and Gracie Hunt, the CEO has not shared a statement.\n\nWhile there is strong conservative support for Butker's message, numerous celebrities have publicly denounced Butker's comments.\n\n\"It was awesome,\" Mahomes said of her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit debut. \"I was happy for her.\" The quarterback revealed that Brittany, with whom he shares two children, asked his opinion before agreeing to do the photoshoot.\n\n\"I was like, 'Go do it, man,'\" he recalled. \"Go show what a mother of two can look and be -- not only how she looks, but the way she co-owns the Kansas City Current and has done these ventures by herself now, become this businesswoman herself.\"\n\nMahomes also credited much of his success to having Brittany by his side. \"I think people don't even realize how much she does,\" he said. \"Taking care of the day-to-day stuff and making it so where I can focus on football, focus on my craft and everything like that. Just being a hall-of-fame mom and a hall-of-fame wife.\n\n\"It makes things a lot easier when you get to come home and your best friend is there. You just hang out.

THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP\n\nNorth Korea says it has released a Canadian pastor who has been serving a life sentence since 2015 for anti-state activities over health reasons.\n\nPyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency said on its website Wednesday that Hyeon Soo Lim was released on \"sick bail\" following a decision by the country's Central Court.\n\nThe news was announced after a delegation from the Canadian government went to Pyongyang to discuss Lim's case.\n\nLim, a pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church of Mississauga, Ont., had been sentenced by a North Korean court to life in prison with hard labour for what it called crimes against the state.\n\nLim was charged with included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans and helping American and South Korean authorities lure and abduct North Korean citizens, along with aiding their programs to assist defectors from the North.\n\nThe pastor went to North Korea on Jan. 31, 2015 for a humanitarian mission, one of more than 100 trips to the country since 1997, to support an orphanage, nursery and nursing home, his relatives and colleagues have said.\n\nThey were also worried about his health, saying he needs medication to manage his blood pressure.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office, told The Canadian Press on Tuesday.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son living in the Toronto area, started the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly three decades ago, shortly after he emigrated from South Korea.\n\nHe grew the congregation from about a dozen people in 1986 to more than 3,000 members. He also runs a smaller church in downtown Toronto that caters to young people.\n\nThe Canadian delegation is led by Daniel Jean, the national security adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe last time a Canadian delegation was sent to Pyongyang to discuss the release of the 62-year-old pastor was in late 2016.\n\nCanada does not have an embassy in North Korea, and has advised against all travel there.\n\nWith files from The Associated Press", "time": "12:24:00"}

He said his father was resting at home and looked forward to going to his church's Sunday service and meeting with the community after so long.\n\n\"Now more than ever, he's never felt more Canadian,\" the son said.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau sent national security adviser Daniel Jean to North Korea to seek Lim's freedom.\n\nLim, a 62-year-old South Korean-born Canadian citizen, was convicted and sentenced in 2015 for allegedly trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system and helping U.S. and South Korean authorities lure and abduct North Korean citizens.\n\nSouth Korea, the U.S. and others often accuse North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions, and foreigners have said after their release that their declarations of guilt were coerced while in North Korean custody.\n\nLim's release came nearly two months after U.S. college student Otto Warmbier died shortly after he was released from North Korea in a coma. Warmbier had been sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in March 2016 after being accused of stealing a propaganda poster.\n\nLim is pastor at the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Toronto. His supporters have said he was on a humanitarian mission to North Korea when he was detained.\n\nCanada does not have diplomatic offices in Pyongyang and relies on Sweden to handle consular issues.\n\nAt least three Americans and six South Koreans remain in custody in the North.", "time": "02:06:00"}

Republic Of -- North Korea says it has released a Canadian pastor who has been serving a life sentence since 2015 for anti-state activities over health reasons.\n\nPyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency said on its website Wednesday that Hyeon Soo Lim was released on \"sick bail\" following a decision by the country's Central Court.\n\nThe news was announced after a delegation from the Canadian government went to Pyongyang to discuss Lim's case.\n\nLim, a pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church of Mississauga, Ont., had been sentenced by a North Korean court to life in prison with hard labour for what it called crimes against the state.\n\nLim was charged with included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans and helping American and South Korean authorities lure and abduct North Korean citizens, along with aiding their programs to assist defectors from the North.\n\nThe pastor went to North Korea on Jan. 31, 2015 for a humanitarian mission, one of more than 100 trips to the country since 1997, to support an orphanage, nursery and nursing home, his relatives and colleagues have said.\n\nThey were also worried about his health, saying he needs medication to manage his blood pressure.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office, told The Canadian Press on Tuesday.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son living in the Toronto area, started the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly three decades ago, shortly after he emigrated from South Korea.\n\nHe grew the congregation from about a dozen people in 1986 to more than 3,000 members. He also runs a smaller church in downtown Toronto that caters to young people.\n\nThe Canadian delegation is led by Daniel Jean, the national security adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nThe last time a Canadian delegation was sent to Pyongyang to discuss the release of the 62-year-old pastor was in late 2016.\n\nCanada does not have an embassy in North Korea, and has advised against all travel there.\n\n-- With files from The Associated Press", "time": "11:30:00"}

labour for what it called crimes against the state.\n\nLim was charged with included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans and helping American and South Korean authorities lure and abduct North Korean citizens, along with aiding their programs to assist defectors from the North.\n\nThe Canadian delegation -- which is led by Daniel Jean, the national security adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- is in the North Korean capital as tensions

part of a regular humanitarian mission to the country where he supports a nursing home, a nursery and an orphanage. They said Lim has made more than 100 trips to North Korea since 1997 and that his trips were about helping people and were not political. They also have said he needs medication to manage his blood pressure.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son living in the Toronto area, started the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly three decades ago, shortly after he emigrated from South Korea.\n\nHe grew the congregation from about a dozen people in 1986 to more than 3,000 members. He also runs a smaller church in downtown Toronto that caters to young people.", "time": "08:11:00"}

which Canadian authorities have strongly denied.\n\nNorth Korea has released a Canadian pastor serving a life sentence there on humanitarian grounds, the country's official KCNA news agency said on Wednesday.\n\nThere was no obvious direct connection between the release and the standoff with the United States, but North Korea has in the past attracted the attention of Washington, and visits by high-profile Americans, with the detention and release of USA citizens.\n\nThe report did not elaborate further details of the visit, but it is speculated that the envoy is there to discuss the issue of Korean-Canadian pastor Lim Hyeon-soo who is now detained in North Korea.\n\nThe news was announced after a delegation from the Canadian government went to Pyongyang to discuss Lim's case.\n\nOn Tuesday, Canadian officials travelled to North Korea to discuss releasing the imprisoned pastor.\n\n\"A Canadian government delegation is now in Pyongyang to discuss Pastor Lim's case\", Trudeau's press secretary Cameron Ahmad said.\n\n'Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case, ' he said.\n\nLim was convicted and sentenced in 2015 on charges of trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system and helping US and South Korean authorities lure and abduct North Korean citizens.\n\nIt comes at a high of heightened tensions between North Korea and the West after US President Donald Trump reacted with fury to an intelligence report that suggested Pyongyang had the nuclear firepower to hit America.\n\nThe pastor was reportedly involved in projects linked to some associates of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un's purged uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who was executed in 2013 for treason.\n\nLast year, Lim told CNN he spends eight hours a day digging holes at a labour camp where he has not seen any other prisoners.", "time": "11:28:00"}

(Source: Reuters) North Korea considering strike on Guam after Donald Trump warns of 'fire and fury'North Korea has produced nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles: reportUS pushes Asian nations on North Korea\n\nNorth Korea freed a Canadian pastor serving a life sentence on humanitarian grounds, the official KCNA news agency said on Wednesday, just hours after the United States warned it would counter any threat from the North with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nThere was no clear connection between the release of Hyeon Soo Lim and the heightened rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang. Canadian officials said on Tuesday a delegation led by the country's national security adviser had gone to North Korea to discuss Lim's case.\n\nLim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, had been sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 after North Korea accused him of attempting to overthrow the regime.\n\n\"Strategically, North Korea perhaps hopes to engender some goodwill from Canada as tensions rise,\" said Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China. \"They hope that Canada presents some\n\nmoderating influence on the Trump administration.\n\n\"(But) I do not think it is directly connected to the tensions the US president has ratcheted up. North Korea is concerned he would die in prison.\" KCNA said Lim had been released on \"sick bail\" by the country's Central Court for humanitarian reasons.\n\nLim, accompanied by his wife and son, is expected to return to Canada on Thursday and will be hospitalized on arrival at his wife's request, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\n\"So far, it has been confirmed that government officials and a doctor are accompanying Reverend Lim,\" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak\n\nto media.\n\nLim's family had become more concerned for his welfare since the death in June of American student Otto Warmbier, who had been held in North Korea for 17 months. Warmbier, sentenced last year to\n\n15 years' hard labour for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel, died in a Cincinnati hospital days after being released in a coma. The circumstances of his death remain unclear.\n\nCanadian Senator Yonah Martin, who advocated for Lim's release, said Lim was hospitalized during his imprisonment.\n\n\"They were sending medication but there was a question as to whether he was actually receiving it in the way he should,\" he said.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not comment on Wednesday.\n\nNorth Korea has in the past attracted the attention of Washington and visits by high-profile Americans with the detention and release of US citizens.\n\nNorth Korea is still holding three Americans. The US State Department said last week it would ban U.S. nationals from travelling to the isolated country from September.\n\nLim's Toronto-area church has said he visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labour camp where he had not seen any other prisoners.\n\nOn Wednesday, North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the US Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump, unhappy with Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: North korea", "time": "16:59:00"}

He was sentenced to hard labour for life in December 2015 on charges of attempting to overthrow the Pyongyang regime.\n\nNews of his release surfaced on Wednesday, when North Korea's KCNA news agency said Lim was being let go on humanitarian grounds, suggesting his health was poor.\n\nThe announcement came amid heightened tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, though authorities have not said there is any connection between his release and efforts to defuse the standoff over North Korea's nuclear programme.\n\nThe pastor's son James Lim said his dad was happy to be back home in Canada, stopping for coffee and a donut at Canada's popular Tim Horton's coffee chain on his way home from the airport.\n\nRev.

He was sentenced to hard labour for life in December 2015 on charges of attempting to overthrow the Pyongyang regime.\n\nNews of his release surfaced on Wednesday, when North Korea's KCNA news agency said Lim was being let go on humanitarian grounds, suggesting his health was poor.\n\nThe announcement came amid heightened tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, though authorities have not said there is any connection between his release and efforts to defuse the standoff over North Korea's nuclear programme.\n\nThe pastor's son James Lim said his dad was happy to be back home in Canada, stopping for coffee and a donut at Canada's popular Tim Horton's coffee chain on his way home from the airport.\n\nThe family asked the public to respect their privacy, allowing him to rest for a day and catch up with family before appearing in public on Sunday to attend services at his church.\n\nFILE PHOTO - South Korea-born Canadian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim stands during his trial at a North Korean court in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang, North Korea on December 16, 2015.KCNA/File Photo\n\nJames Lim said his dad was in \"good health,\" but noted that the family planned to arrange for extended medical attention, including checkups.\n\n\"He is doing very well, considering everything he has gone through,\" he said.\n\nThe family thanked the Canadian government for helping secure his Lim's release. They declined to provide details on negotiations with the North Koreans.\n\n\"It's a delicate dance. There's a lot of complexity to it,\" James Lim said.\n\nHe added that getting the pastor home took on increased urgency in June, following the death of Otto Warmbier, an American student who died days after being released from a North Korean prison in a coma.\n\nThe Canadian government issued a statement saying it joined Lim's family and congregation in celebrating his homecoming.\n\n\"Canada has been actively engaged on Mr. Lim's case at all levels, and we will continue to support him and his family now that he has returned,\" the statement said.", "time": "08:35:00"}

a Canadian pastor released from a North Korean prison said Thursday he is now on his way home.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also confirmed that Hyeon Soo Lim has been released and will soon be reunited with his family. He had been serving a life sentence since 2015 for alleged anti-state activities.\n\nThe Korean Central News Agency on Wednesday reported the pastor had been released on what it called \"sick bail,\" but no other details were given.\n\nFamily spokeswoman Lisa Pak said in a statement \"there is a long way to go\" in terms of Lim's healing and said he needs privacy while receiving unspecified medical attention. Park said the family is relieved, grateful and anxious to see him.\n\nLim, a 62-year-old South Korean-born Canadian citizen, was convicted and sentenced in 2015 on charges of trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system and helping U.S. and South Korean authorities lure and abduct North Korean citizens.\n\nSouth Korea, the U.S. and others often accuse North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions, and foreigners have said after their release that their declarations of guilt had been coerced while in North Korean custody.\n\nLim's release came nearly two months after U.S. college student Otto Warmbier died shortly after he was released from North Korea in a coma. Warmbier had been sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in March 2016 after being accused of stealing a propaganda poster.\n\nLim pastored the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Toronto. His supporters have said he was on a humanitarian mission to North Korea when he was detained.\n\nCanada does not have diplomatic offices in Pyongyang and relies on Sweden to handle consular issues. Lim met with the Swedish ambassador at least twice this year and met Canadian officials in December. Trudeau sent his national security adviser, Daniel Jean, to Pyongyang this week.\n\n\"The Government of Canada was actively engaged on Mr. Lim's case at all levels. In particular, I want to thank Sweden, our protecting power in North Korea, for assisting us,\" Trudeau said.\n\nAt least three Americans and six South Koreans remain in custody in the North.\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Sweden's embassy in Pyongyang, which represents several Western nations in the insular nation, had also helped, the statement said.\n\n\"Operational security considerations prevent us from discussing the matter further,\" it said.\n\nLim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, had been sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 after North Korea accused him of attempting to overthrow the regime.\n\n\"Strategically, North Korea perhaps hopes to engender some goodwill from Canada as tensions rise,\" said Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China. \"They hope that Canada presents some moderating influence on the Trump administration.\n\n\"(But) I do not think it is directly connected to the tensions the U.S. president has ratcheted up. North Korea is concerned he would die in prison.\"\n\nNorth Korea has in the past attracted the attention of Washington and visits by high-profile Americans with the detention and release of U.S. citizens.\n\nKCNA said Lim had been released on \"sick bail\" by the country's Central Court for humanitarian reasons.\n\nLim is expected to return to Canada later on Thursday and will be hospitalised on arrival at his wife's request, a source familiar with the matter said. His family is arriving separately.\n\n\"So far, it has been confirmed that government officials and a doctor are accompanying Reverend Lim,\" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to media.\n\nLim's family had become more concerned for his welfare since the death in June of American student Otto Warmbier, who had been held in North Korea for 17 months. Warmbier, sentenced last year to 15 years' hard labour for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel, died in a Cincinnati hospital days after being released in a coma. The circumstances of his death remain unclear.\n\nCanadian Senator Yonah Martin, who advocated for Lim's release, said Lim was hospitalised during his imprisonment.\n\n\"They were sending medication but there was a question as to whether he was actually receiving it in the way he should.\"\n\nNorth Korea is still holding three Americans. The U.S. State Department said last week it would ban U.S. nationals from travelling to the isolated country from September.\n\nLim's Toronto-area church has said he visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labour camp where he had not seen any other prisoners.\n\nOn Wednesday, North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump, unhappy with Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with \"fire and fury.\"", "time": "11:10:00"}

Canadian officials said on Tuesday a delegation led by the country's national security adviser had travelled to North Korea to discuss Lim's case.\n\nLim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, had been sentenced to hard labour for life in December 2015 after North Korea accused him of attempting to overthrow the regime. KCNA said Lim had been released on \"sick bail\" by the country's Central Court for humanitarian reasons.\n\nLim, accompanied by his wife and son, is expected to return to Canada on Thursday and will be hospitalized on arrival at his wife's request, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\n\"So far, it has been confirmed that government officials and a doctor are accompanying Reverend Lim,\" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media.\n\nLim's family had become more concerned for his welfare since the death in June of American student Otto Warmbier, who had been held in North Korea for 17 months. Warmbier, sentenced last year to 15 years' hard labour for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel, died in a Cincinnati hospital just days after being released in a coma. The circumstances of his death remain unclear.\n\nNorth Korea has in the past attracted the attention of Washington and visits by high-profile Americans with the detention and release of U.S. citizens.\n\nNorth Korea is still holding three Americans. The U.S. State Department said last week it would ban U.S. nationals from travelling to the isolated country, beginning in September.\n\nLim's Toronto-area church has said he visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labour camp where he had not seen any other prisoners.\n\nOn Wednesday, North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump, unhappy with Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with \"fire and fury.\"", "time": "21:03:00"}

the decision of the Central Court of the North.\n\nLim, a Korean-Canadian pastor, has been held in captivity in the North since he entered the country via China on a humanitarian mission in January 2015.\n\nIn December, the North's highest court sentenced Lim to life in prison with hard labor, citing his \"subversive plots\" against the North's regime.\n\nHis release came one day after a special envoy of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau arrived in the North.\n\nDaniel Jean, national security advisor to the prime minister of Canada, and his party arrived in Pyongyang, the KCNA reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe visit drew speculation that the envoy was to persuade the North to release the detained pastor.\n\nLim's family has been urging the Canadian government to step up efforts to release him after U.S. college student Otto Warmbier was released in a coma from North Korea in June following a 17-month detention and died days after a medical evacuation.\n\nLim has visited the country

Lim, 61, was freed on \"sick bail\", the agency announced after a Canadian government delegation arrived in Pyongyang to discuss the case.\n\nA court ordered Lim's release \"from the humanitarian viewpoint\", it said in a brief two-paragraph report.\n\nLim was arrested in 2015 for allegedly meddling in North Korean state affairs.\n\nThe South Korean-born pastor had been accused of subversive acts against Pyongyang, an allegation which Canadian authorities strongly denied.\n\nA Canadian delegation including national security adviser Daniel Jean visited Pyongyang this week to discuss the case.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" said Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in Ottawa before the release.\n\nLim's family told local media they had become increasingly worried about his welfare since the death of American student Otto Warmbier in June, just days after he had been released from a North Korean prison.\n\nThree US citizens remain in custody as relations with Washington worsen sharply. The North said earlier Wednesday it was considering a missile strike near US bases in Guam.\n\nThat comment came hours after US President Donald Trump threatened Pyongyang with \"fire and fury\" over its missile programme.\n\nAt the time of Lim's arrest, other members of the close-knit circle of ethnic Korean missionaries in Canada and the United States called him one of the most influential Christian missionaries operating in North Korea.\n\nHe had visited the country dozens of times, working with orphanages and nursing homes.\n\nBut some projects he worked on, including a noodle plant and flour mills, were linked to associates of Jang Song-Thaek, the purged uncle of leader Kim Jong-Un.\n\nJang was arrested and executed for treason in December 2013.\n\nLim told CNN last year that he spent his days in prison digging holes. \"I wasn't originally a labourer so the labour was hard at first,\" he said, his head shaven.\n\nPyongyang views foreign missionaries with deep suspicion, though it allows some to undertake humanitarian work.\n\nA number of Christian missionaries -- mostly ethnic Koreans who are US citizens -- have been arrested in the past, with some of them only allowed to return home after intervention by high-profile US political figures.", "time": "12:14:00"}

Canadian officials said on Tuesday a delegation led by the country's national security adviser had gone to North Korea to discuss Lim's case.\n\nLim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, had been sentenced to hard labour for life in December 2015 after North Korea accused him of attempting to overthrow the regime.\n\n\"Strategically, North Korea perhaps hopes to engender some goodwill from Canada as tensions rise,\" said Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China. \"They hope that Canada presents some moderating influence on the Trump administration.\n\n\"(But) I do not think it is directly connected to the tensions the US president has ratcheted up.

anti-state activities, due to health reasons.\n\nBut there were no details about when or how Hyeon Soo Lim might return to Canada.\n\nPyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency said on its website Wednesday that Lim was released on \"sick bail\" following a decision by the country's Central Court.\n\nThe news was announced after a delegation from the Canadian government went to Pyongyang to discuss Lim's case.\n\nLim, a 62-year-old pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church of Mississauga, Ont., had been sentenced by a North Korean court to life in prison with hard labour for what it called crimes against the state.\n\nJohn Bae, administrative pastor at the Mississauga church, said he learned of the release early Wednesday, but had no other details.\n\n\"We don't know when Rev. Lim's going to get to Toronto. I'm in my office waiting for a call from somewhere, confirming that he's here,\" Bae said with a laugh. \"I haven't heard anything yet.\"\n\nBae said he got word of Lim's release in a text from Jason Noh, the church's senior pastor, who happened to be in South Korea, one destination on a trip to Asia. Noh planned to rush back to Canada, Bae said.\n\nThere was little comment from Canadian officials.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" said Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office.\n\nLim went to North Korea on Jan. 31, 2015, for a humanitarian mission, one of more than 100 trips to the country since 1997, to support an orphanage, nursery and nursing home, his relatives and colleagues have said.\n\nHe was charged with harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans and helping American and South Korean authorities lure and abduct North Korean citizens, along with aiding their programs to assist defectors from the North.\n\nAssociates were worried about Lim's health, saying he needs medication to manage his blood pressure.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son, started the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly three decades ago, shortly after he emigrated from South Korea.\n\nHe grew the congregation from about a dozen people in 1986 to more than 3,000 members.

The last delegation travelled to North Korea in late 2016.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" said Cameron Ahmad, media relations manager for the Prime Minister's Office, in an email.\n\n\"As this is an active case, we will not provide further comment at this time.\"\n\nThis government visit comes less than a month after North Koreans arranged a July 14 meeting \"in the humanitarian spirit\" between the imprisoned Lim and a Swedish Embassy diplomat in Pyongyang, according to state media outlet Korean Central News Agency.\n\nLim has high blood pressure and requires medication, which the North Koreans have allowed to be sent to him. Lim is reportedly in failing health and has lost upwards of 60 pounds.\n\nThe pastor, who has made more than 110 humanitarian missions to North Korea on behalf of his church, has been in detention since January 2015. He went missing during a routine visit in a northern region where the Canadian was a familiar face. Local officials had granted him a frequent access visa.\n\nWeeks after his disappearance, North Korean authorities confirmed they'd arrested Lim, purportedly for scheming to overthrow Kim Jong Un's authoritarian regime. The pastor was sentenced to life in a hard labour camp in late 2015.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump says North Korea will be met with 'fire and the fury like the world has never seen' if it doesn't stop threatening the U.S.", "time": "22:38:00"}

North Korea freed a Canadian pastor serving a life sentence on humanitarian grounds, the official KCNA news agency said on Wednesday, just hours after the United States warned it would counter any threat from the North with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nThere was no clear connection between the release of Hyeon Soo Lim and the heightened rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang. Canadian officials said on Tuesday a delegation led by the country's national security adviser had gone to North Korea to discuss Lim's case.\n\nLim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, had been sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 after North Korea accused him of attempting to overthrow the regime.\n\n\"Strategically, North Korea perhaps hopes to engender some goodwill from Canada as tensions rise,\" said Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China. \"They hope that Canada presents some moderating influence on the Trump administration.\n\n\"(But) I do not think it is directly connected to the tensions the U.S. president has ratcheted up. North Korea is concerned he would die in prison.\"\n\nKCNA said Lim had been released on \"sick bail\" by the country's Central Court for humanitarian reasons.\n\nLim, accompanied by his wife and son, is expected to return to Canada on Thursday and will be hospitalized on arrival at his wife's request, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\n\"So far, it has been confirmed that government officials and a doctor are accompanying Reverend Lim,\" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media.\n\nLim's family had become more concerned for his welfare since the death in June of American student Otto Warmbier, who had been held in North Korea for 17 months. Warmbier, sentenced last year to 15 years' hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel, died in a Cincinnati hospital days after being released in a coma. The circumstances of his death remain unclear.\n\nCanadian Senator Yonah Martin, who advocated for Lim's release, said Lim was hospitalized during his imprisonment.\n\n\"They were sending medication but there was a question as to whether he was actually receiving it in the way he should,\" he said.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not comment on Wednesday.\n\nNorth Korea has in the past attracted the attention of Washington and visits by high-profile Americans with the detention and release of U.S. citizens.\n\nNorth Korea is still holding three Americans. The U.S. State Department said last week it would ban U.S. nationals from traveling to the isolated country from September.\n\nLim's Toronto-area church has said he visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labor camp where he had not seen any other prisoners.\n\nOn Wednesday, North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump, unhappy with Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with \"fire and fury.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Leah Schnurr in Ottawa, Ben Blanchard in Beijing and Chris Arsenault in Toronto; Editing by Bill Trott and James Dalgleish)", "time": "01:37:00"}

But during his last trip in 2015, he was detained and charged with attempting to overthrow North Korea's regime using religion.\n\nIn what is believed to be a coerced statement, Lim soon admitted to the crimes after being sentenced to hard labour for life.\n\n\"There were rumours that he was affiliated with the uncle that Kim Jong Un had executed a few years back, and that was partly the reason for his incarceration,\" Jack Kim, a senior advisor with HanVoice, a Canada-based human rights organization that assists North Korean refugees, recently told CTV News.\n\nThen, two years and dozens of delicate diplomatic communications later, a Canadian delegation led by Daniel Jean, a national security advisor to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, travelled to Pyongyang this week to discuss Lim's case in person.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" Prime Minister's Office spokesperson Cameron Ahmad told The Canadian Press on Tuesday.\n\nThat delegation was pivotal towards securing Lim's release, Ontario MPP Raymond Cho said.\n\n\"It is important that Kim Jong Un got the representatives from Canada, so we saved his face,\" Cho, who is Korean-Canadian, told CTV News. \"It is a very good gesture.\"\n\nSince being imprisoned, Lim's health was reportedly failing. He suffers from high blood pressure and allegedly lost nearly 40 kilograms while incarcerated.\n\nAccording to North Korea's news agency, Lim was released on \"sick bail.\"\n\nLim's release comes just weeks after North Korea freed 22-year-old American student Otto Warmbier, who was imprisoned in 2016 after allegedly trying to steal a propaganda poster. Brought home in a coma with obvious signs of torture, Warmbier died on June 19, just six days after arriving in the U.S.\n\n\"I am sure the North Koreans, they don't want to see the same thing with Reverend Hyeon Soo Lim, so that might be the deciding factor,\" Cho added.\n\nThere is, however, still no timeline for when Lim will be returned to Canada. His current whereabouts also remain unknown. As for his health issues, the North Korean government has not given any indication of just how sick the pastor has become.\n\nLim's parishioners say that have never lost faith and never stopped praying since their pastor was imprisoned in North Korea. But when word spread that Lim had finally been released on Wednesday, many met the news with disbelief.\n\n\"When I made the announcement this morning at service, they were like, 'Are you sure that's true?'\" associate pastor Charles Baik told CTV News.\n\nAmongst his family and parishioners, concerns still remain that speaking out about the case could jeopardize Lim's release. But it may come as some solace to Lim's congregation and family that when a U.S. diplomat recently went to North Korea to retrieve Warmbier, he reported seeing Lim and said that he was still able to stand.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son in the Toronto area, formed the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly 30 years ago, soon after emigrating to Canada from South Korea.", "time": "02:36:00"}

Sweden's embassy in Pyongyang, which represents several Western nations in the insular nation, had also helped, the statement said.\n\n\"Operational security considerations prevent us from discussing the matter further,\" it said.\n\nLim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, had been sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 after North Korea accused him of attempting to overthrow the regime.\n\n\"Strategically, North Korea perhaps hopes to engender some goodwill from Canada as tensions rise,\" said Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China. \"They hope that Canada presents some moderating influence on the Trump administration.\n\n\"(But) I do not think it is directly connected to the tensions the U.S. president has ratcheted up. North Korea is concerned he would die in prison.\"\n\nNorth Korea has in the past attracted the attention of Washington and visits by high-profile Americans with the detention and release of U.S. citizens.\n\nKCNA said Lim had been released on \"sick bail\" by the country's Central Court for humanitarian reasons.\n\nLim is expected to return to Canada later on Thursday and will be hospitalised on arrival at his wife's request, a source familiar with the matter said. His family is arriving separately.\n\n\"So far, it has been confirmed that government officials and a doctor are accompanying Reverend Lim,\" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to media.\n\nLim's family had become more concerned for his welfare since the death in June of American student Otto Warmbier, who had been held in North Korea for 17 months. Warmbier, sentenced last year to 15 years' hard labour for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel, died in a Cincinnati hospital days after being released in a coma. The circumstances of his death remain unclear.\n\nCanadian Senator Yonah Martin, who advocated for Lim's release, said Lim was hospitalised during his imprisonment.\n\n\"They were sending medication but there was a question as to whether he was actually receiving it in the way he should.\"\n\nNorth Korea is still holding three Americans. The U.S. State Department said last week it would ban U.S. nationals from travelling to the isolated country from September.\n\nLim's Toronto-area church has said he visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labour camp where he had not seen any other prisoners.\n\nOn Wednesday, North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump, unhappy with Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with \"fire and fury.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Leah Schnurr in Ottawa, Ben Blanchard in Beijing, James Pearson in Seoul and Chris Arsenault in Toronto; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "time": "07:49:00"}

THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP\n\nA church congregation in the GTA is celebrating news of the release of their pastor from a North Korean prison more than two years after he was arrested in the country.\n\nA decision from North Korea's central court freed Hyeon Soo Lim from the prison where he was serving a life sentence for anti-state activities, the country's Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday.\n\nThe pastor's release, which came on the heels of an official visit from a Canadian government delegation, was described as \"sick bail\" by the news agency. No other details were provided.\n\nIn a brief statement issued early Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was \"pleased and relieved\" that Lim had been released.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada, and we are working to ensure that he receives any required medical attention,\" said Trudeau.\n\nThe prime minister also thanked Sweden for its assistance in the matter but said \"operational security considerations\" prevents the government from discussing the matter further.\n\nLim, a pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga had been sentenced by a North Korean court to life in prison with hard labour for what it called crimes against the state.\n\nCharges against him included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans, and helping American and South Korean efforts to help people defect from the north.\n\nWord of Lim's release drew members of his congregation to their church, just west of Toronto, where they were seen hugging and crying Wednesday morning.\n\nCharles Baik, an associate pastor with the church's English ministry, said members are ecstatic at the prospect of Lim's return.\n\n\"We're so happy he's been released,\" Baik said from outside the church. Watch the video below or click here.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son living in the Toronto area, started the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly three decades ago, shortly after he emigrated from South Korea.\n\nHe grew the congregation from about a dozen people in 1986 to more than 3,000 members. He also runs a smaller church in downtown Toronto that caters to young people.\n\nThe church has taken on numerous humanitarian projects in North Korea, one of which prompted Lim's last trip there in January 2015.\n\nFamily and friends previously said he was visiting an orphanage, nursery and nursing home in the country at the time of his arrest. The pastor had successfully travelled to North Korea more than 100 times over the past two decades, they added.\n\nBaik said the pastor's ordeal would not deter the church from future humanitarian projects in the country.\n\n\"Missions will never stop, no matter where they may be,\" he said.\n\nFamily members had urged the Canadian government to put pressure on North Korea to secure Lim's release.\n\nTheir calls for action took on fresh urgency in June following the death of Otto Warmbier, an American student who lived only one week after being released from North Korean custody due to health concerns.\n\nLim's own health was of concern to his family members, who had said the pastor needed medication to manage his blood pressure.\n\nA Canadian delegation led by Daniel Jean, the national security adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, was in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang this week to discuss Lim's case.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office, told The Canadian Press on Tuesday.\n\nNeither Ahmad nor Global Affairs responded to request for comment on Lim's release.\n\nCanada does not have an embassy in North Korea, and has advised against all travel there.\n\nWith files from The Associated Press", "time": "10:35:00"}

Canadian officials said on Tuesday a delegation led by the country's national security adviser had gone to North Korea to discuss Lim's case.\n\nLim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, had been sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 after North Korea accused him of attempting to overthrow the regime.\n\n\"Strategically, North Korea perhaps hopes to engender some goodwill from Canada as tensions rise,\" said Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China. \"They hope that Canada presents some moderating influence on the Trump administration.\n\n\"(But) I do not think it is directly connected to the tensions the U.S. president has ratcheted up. North Korea is concerned he would die in prison.\"\n\nKCNA said Lim had been released on \"sick bail\" by the country's Central Court for humanitarian reasons.\n\nLim, accompanied by his wife and son, is expected to return to Canada on Thursday and will be hospitalized on arrival at his wife's request, a source familiar with the matter said.\n\n\"So far, it has been confirmed that government officials and a doctor are accompanying Reverend Lim,\" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media.\n\nLim's family had become more concerned for his welfare since the death in June of American student Otto Warmbier, who had been held in North Korea for 17 months. Warmbier, sentenced last year to 15 years' hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel, died in a Cincinnati hospital days after being released in a coma. The circumstances of his death remain unclear.\n\nCanadian Senator Yonah Martin, who advocated for Lim's release, said Lim was hospitalized during his imprisonment.\n\n\"They were sending medication but there was a question as to whether he was actually receiving it in the way he should,\" he said.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not comment on Wednesday.\n\nNorth Korea has in the past attracted the attention of Washington and visits by high-profile Americans with the detention and release of U.S. citizens.\n\nNorth Korea is still holding three Americans. The U.S. State Department said last week it would ban U.S. nationals from traveling to the isolated country from September.\n\nLim's Toronto-area church has said he visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labor camp where he had not seen any other prisoners.\n\nOn Wednesday, North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump, unhappy with Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with \"fire and fury.\" REUTERS", "time": "16:53:00"}

security adviser has travelled to North Korea as a special envoy to discuss the case of an imprisoned Toronto pastor.\n\nDaniel Jean, who serves as Mr. Trudeau's national security and intelligence adviser, is leading a Canadian delegation in Pyongyang to discuss pastor Hyeon Soo Lim's case, a senior government official told The Globe and Mail. While the purpose of the visit is to discuss Mr. Lim's case, the delegation will also raise \"other issues of regional concern,\" the official said. The news of Mr. Jean's visit was first reported by North Korean state-run media.\n\nThe visit comes as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up his rhetoric against Pyongyang, warning that North Korea would be met with \"fire and fury\" if it threatens the United States. Earlier, Pyongyang said it was ready to give Washington a \"severe lesson\" with its strategic nuclear force in response to any U.S. military action.\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office confirmed that Ottawa has sent a delegation to Pyongyang to discuss Mr. Lim's case, but would not provide any specifics about the visit.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" PMO spokesman Cameron Ahmad said in an e-mail.\n\n\"As this is an active case, we will not provide further comment at this time.\"\n\nThe visit marks at least the third time Canadian officials have visited Mr. Lim since he was imprisoned, most recently in December 2016.\n\nMr. Lim, who is in his early 60s, was a pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga, Ont. The church has said Mr. Lim visited North Korea more than 100 times since 1997, where he helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Mr. Lim's relatives and colleagues have said he travelled to North Korea on Jan. 31, 2014, as part of a regular humanitarian mission to the country. He was later detained.\n\nIn December 2015, he was sentenced to hard labour for life by North Korea's Supreme Court for what it says was an attempt to overthrow the regime.\n\nThe crimes Mr. Lim was charged with included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans and helping U.S. and South Korean authorities lure and abduct North Korean citizens, along with aiding their programs to assist defectors from the North.\n\nMr. Lim said in a January 2016 interview with CNN that he spends eight hours a day digging holes at a labour camp where he has not seen any other prisoners. His church has said he has a \"very serious health problem, very high blood pressure.\"\n\nIn the CNN interview, Mr. Lim said the experience has not shaken his faith, and he continues to pray.\n\n\"I hope I can go home some day,\" he told CNN. \"Nobody knows if I will ever go home, but that is my hope. I miss my family. I am longing to see them again, and my congregation.\"\n\nCanada established diplomatic relations with Pyongyang in 2001 but froze them in 2010. Ottawa now says it will only talk to North Korea about regional security, human rights and consular cases.", "time": "00:11:00"}

He was sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 on charges of attempting to overthrow the Pyongyang regime.\n\nNews of his release surfaced on Wednesday, when North Korea's KCNA news agency said Lim was being let go on humanitarian grounds, suggesting his health was poor.\n\nThe announcement came amid heightened tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, though authorities have not said there is any connection between his release and efforts to defuse the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program.\n\nThe pastor's son James Lim said his dad was happy to be back home in Canada, stopping for coffee and a donut at Canada's popular Tim Horton's coffee chain on his way home from the airport.\n\nThe family asked the public to respect their privacy, allowing him to rest for a day and catch up with family before appearing in public on Sunday to attend services at his church.\n\nJames Lim said his dad was in \"good health,\" but noted that the family planned to arrange for extended medical attention, including checkups.\n\n\"He is doing very well, considering everything he has gone through,\" he said.\n\nThe family thanked the Canadian government for helping secure his Lim's release. They declined to provide details on negotiations with the North Koreans.\n\n\"It's a delicate dance.

"body": "Hyeon Soo Lim was expected to fly on a Canadian government charter directly from Pyongyang, North Korea, to Ottawa, where he will reunite with his family.\n\nHyeon Soo Lim is free.\n\nAfter two and a half years of detention in North Korea, Lim -- the senior pastor at the Light Presbyterian Church in Mississauga -- is heading home Thursday.\n\nThe 62-year-old was expected to fly on a Canadian government charter directly from the North Korean capital of Pyongyang to Ottawa, where he will reunite with his family. The Lims -- who have not seen each other in person since the pastor's detention in 2015 -- will then travel to Toronto, where the family has a west-end home.\n\nSen. Yonah Martin, deputy leader of the Conservatives in the Senate, is a friend of Lim's. She described her reaction to the Toronto man's imminent release as \"relief and disbelief -- with a lot of anxiousness mixed in.\"\n\n\"I had a great sense of relief but it took me by surprise only because it had been so long,\" she said of Lim's detention -- more than 900 days.\n\n\"This is long-awaited.\"\n\nOn Monday, a high-ranking Canadian government delegation quietly flew to Pyongyang to discuss Lim's release. The group, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's national security adviser, Daniel Jean, secured Lim's freedom and by Wednesday, preparations for departure were underway.\n\nThe news was first reported by North Korea's state media as a \"sick bail\" decision by the country's Central Court, granted on humanitarian grounds.\n\n\"Rim Hyon Su, a Canadian civilian, was released on sick bail according to the decision of the Central Court of the DPRK on Aug. 9, 2017 from the humanitarian viewpoint,\" the Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday, using the country's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\n\"He (Lim) had been under the penalty of indefinite hard labour as he conducted hostile deeds against the DPRK,\" the news agency continued.\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office had no comment on Lim's release Wednesday.\n\nJean's delicate Canadian mission to extricate Lim -- thought to be the longest-held western prisoner in North Korea -- was carried out as tensions amplified this week between the United States and North Korea over nuclear capabilities. U.S. President Donald Trump's warning about unleashing \"fire and fury\" on the authoritarian regime spurred North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to threaten a missile strike on Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific.\n\nA medical doctor was reportedly aboard the Canadian charter.\n\nAs prisoner No. 036, Lim dug holes for eight hours a day, six days a week, in a hard-labour camp since December 2015.\n\nLim is apparently in poor health and has lost weight. He has high blood pressure, a condition that requires medication. The North Koreans permitted that medicine to be sent to Lim, via the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang.\n\nCanada does not have a diplomatic presence in North Korea and the Swedish Embassy serves as the protective power for Canadians there.\n\nLim, a native of South Korea, is the spiritual leader of one of Canada's largest churches. The Light Presbyterian Church has about 3,000 members, a congregation that under Lim's stewardship grew from about half a dozen families over two decades.\n\nAs part of his ministry, Lim developed a passion for humanitarian work.\n\nHe and church colleagues travelled to countries including Iraq, Afghanistan and North Korea on charitable visits. Lim eventually decided to devote more time and money to the needy in North Korea, making about 110 trips there since 1997. Besides bringing in food, Lim's charitable operations included supporting orphanages and a seniors' nursing home.\n\nOn his last visit, Lim went missing the same day he crossed the border from China into a northern region in late January 2015. North Korean authorities later confirmed they'd detained the Canadian. In December of that year, Lim was convicted of ostensibly plotting to overthrow the Kim regime and was given a life sentence in a hard labour camp.\n\nRaymond Cho, the Progressive Conservative MPP for Scarborough-Rouge River, said he prayed for the return of his friend, whom he calls \"a gentle man.\"\n\n\"I believe in the power of prayer,\" said Cho, who has known Lim for two decades. \"I prayed for him every night, twice a night.\"\n\nCho, like Lim a native of South Korea, said the pastor will need time to rest and recover to full health but for now, he's relieved at Lim's release.\n\n\"The bottom line is he's coming home,\" Cho said.\n\nWith files from Bruce Campion-Smith", "time": "01:11:00"}

Hyeon Soo Lim.\n\nThe Canadian, who spoke to CBC News and asked not to be identified, said the six-member delegation arrived on Aug. 6. The outcome -- Lim's release -- was a certainty from North Korea's perspective, but Canadian officials were still not sure it was a done deal.\n\n\"Right up until the very end, I guess our government did not trust the process,\" said the source, who had knowledge of the events leading up to Lim's release.\n\nState-run North Korean media reported Lim was freed on \"sick bail ... from the humanitarian viewpoint.\"\n\nLim was arrested in February 2015, when the Conservative government of Stephen Harper was in office, and was sentenced in December of that year to a life of hard labour for allegedly trying to overthrow the regime.\n\nThe Canadian said the scenario could have played out more simply and swiftly if the federal government had agreed earlier to provide a leader-to-leader meeting or high-level communication. After a foreign national receives a life sentence, only the North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un can grant clemency according to the Constitution, the source said.\n\nOfficials in the Prime Minister's Office would not confirm any details about Lim's release and it is not known when he is expected to arrive in Canada.\n\nLim's release comes after Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old U.S. student, died one week after his release from North Korea after 17 months in prison. He returned in a coma, and his family believes he was tortured and left in a vegetative state.\n\nJack Kim, special adviser for HanVoice, a group that advocates for human rights in North Korea, said the timing of Lim's release could be related to the Warmbier case as well as the pastor's reported ailing health. North Korea holds all the cards, as no Western countries have any leverage with the regime, he said.\n\nNorth Korea also uses high-profile cases as a domestic propaganda tool, with the visits of leaders of senior officials lending legitimacy to the regime.\n\n\"The fact that the North Koreans were the first ones to announce this goes to show they see the propaganda value out of it,\" he said.\n\nLim served at one of the largest churches in Canada, Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga, Ont.\n\nThe 62-year-old, who was born in South Korea, is reportedly in poor health and needs medication to treat high blood pressure.\n\nConservative Sen. Yonah Martin, who was instrumental in keeping the case before the federal government, welcomed news of the release as a \"great relief.\"\n\nShe agreed recent developments served as a \"wake-up call\" for Lim's supporters as well as the authorities holding him.\n\n\"I think the death of Otto Warmbier and the failing health of Rev. Lim -- and this is my opinion -- would give North Korean officials cause to worry,\" said Martin. \"I'm told by people who do humanitarian work in North Korea that they hold a very positive view of Canada and I always knew in my heart that the release of Rev. Lim was possible.\"\n\nWhile she does not have direct knowledge of the negotiations, Tina Park, executive director of the Toronto-based Canadian Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, does understand Kim Jong-un's regime and its desire to be taken seriously on the world stage.\n\nAnd that is a significant dilemma Canadian officials faced.\n\nPark said they had to ask themselves, in the current high-tension climate: \"Are we giving more legitimacy to the North Korean dictator by speaking to his people and treating him as an equal? Her answer to that question is a heavily qualified: \"Yes ... perhaps.\"\n\nBut Park argues the life of an important humanitarian hung in the balance.\n\n\"I think the prime minister and his advisers did the right thing by stepping up and actually saving someone's life,\" she said.\n\nThe release comes as tensions mount between Pyongyang and Washington over North Korea's missile and nuclear weapons tests. The isolated state said it is considering an attack against the U.S. territory of Guam after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened it with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen.\"\n\nLim's church has said he had visited North Korea more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Canada does not have an embassy in North Korea, and has advised against all travel there.\n\nDaniel Lee, president of the Korean Canadian Cultural Association, called Lim's release good news for the community and entire country.\n\n\"One of us is coming back home after years of unjust accusations,\" he said.", "time": "21:29:00"}

He was sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 on charges of attempting to overthrow the Pyongyang regime.\n\nNews of his release surfaced on Wednesday, when North Korea's KCNA news agency said Lim was being let go on humanitarian grounds, suggesting his health was poor.\n\nThe announcement came amid heightened tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, though authorities have not said there is any connection between his release and efforts to defuse the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program.\n\nThe pastor's son James Lim said his dad was happy to be back home in Canada, stopping for coffee and a donut at Canada's popular Tim Horton's coffee chain on his way home from the airport.\n\nThe family asked the public to respect their privacy, allowing him to rest for a day and catch up with family before appearing in public on Sunday to attend services at his church.\n\nJames Lim said his dad was in \"good health,\" but noted that the family planned to arrange for extended medical attention, including checkups.\n\n\"He is doing very well, considering everything he has gone through,\" he said.\n\nThe family thanked the Canadian government for helping secure his Lim's release. They declined to provide details on negotiations with the North Koreans.\n\n\"It's a delicate dance. There's a lot of complexity to it,\" James Lim said.\n\nHe added that getting the pastor home took on increased urgency in June, following the death of Otto Warmbier, an American student who died days after being released from a North Korean prison in a coma.\n\nThe Canadian government issued a statement saying it joined Lim's family and congregation in celebrating his homecoming.\n\n\"Canada has been actively engaged on Mr. Lim's case at all levels, and we will continue to support him and his family now that he has returned,\" the statement said.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "time": "04:30:00"}

News Agency (KCNA) on July 30, 2015 shows Canadian reverend Hyeon Soo Lim. -- AFP picSEOUL, Aug 9 -- A Canadian pastor serving a life sentence with hard labour in North Korea was released today on medical parole as a humanitarian gesture, the official KCNA news agency said.\n\nHyeon Soo Lim, 61, was freed on \"sick bail\", the agency announced after a Canadian government delegation arrived in Pyongyang to discuss the case.\n\nA court ordered Lim's release \"from the humanitarian viewpoint\", it said in a brief two-paragraph report.\n\nLim was arrested in 2015 for allegedly meddling in North Korean state affairs.\n\nThe South Korean-born pastor had been accused of subversive acts against Pyongyang, an allegation which Canadian authorities strongly denied.\n\nA Canadian delegation including national security adviser Daniel Jean visited Pyongyang this week to discuss the case.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" said Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in Ottawa before the release.\n\nLim's family told local media they had become increasingly worried about his welfare since the death of American student Otto Warmbier in June, just days after he had been released from a North Korean prison.\n\nThree US citizens remain in custody as relations with Washington worsen sharply. The North said earlier today it was considering a missile strike near US bases in Guam.\n\nThat comment came hours after US President Donald Trump threatened Pyongyang with \"fire and fury\" over its missile programme.\n\nAt the time of Lim's arrest, other members of the close-knit circle of ethnic Korean missionaries in Canada and the United States called him one of the most influential Christian missionaries operating in North Korea.\n\nHe had visited the country dozens of times, working with orphanages and nursing homes.\n\nBut some projects he worked on, including a noodle plant and flour mills, were linked to associates of Jang Song-Thaek, the purged uncle of leader Kim Jong-Un.\n\nJang was arrested and executed for treason in December 2013.\n\nLim told CNN last year that he spent his days in prison digging holes. \"I wasn't originally a labourer so the labour was hard at first,\" he said, his head shaven.\n\nPyongyang views foreign missionaries with deep suspicion, though it allows some to undertake humanitarian work.\n\nA number of Christian missionaries -- mostly ethnic Koreans who are US citizens -- have been arrested in the past, with some of them only allowed to return home after intervention by high-profile US political figures. -- AFP", "time": "13:40:00"}

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nStory highlightsCanadian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim has been detained in North Korea since 2015North Korea hasn't confirmed whether the Canadian envoy's visit is related to Lim\n\n(CNN)A Canadian government envoy, Daniel Jean, national security adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and his party arrived in Pyongyang, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported. It gave no further details about why the Canadian official was there.\n\nCanadian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim has been detained in North Korea for about 2\u00bd years. The 62-year-old's health has deteriorated while in North Korean custody, and the pastor has experienced \"dramatic\" weight loss, family spokeswoman Lisa Pak said. In letters to family, friends, and members of his church in Mississauga, Ontario, Lim has complained of stomach pain and high blood pressure. The Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang has served as an intermediary for Lim, as they do with other prisoners from countries with no formal diplomatic relations with North Korea. This has included passing letters, and also blood pressure medication, according to the Lim family. Read MoreLim's family had stepped up calls for his release since the death of American university student Otto Warmbier in June. Warmbier was on a sightseeing tour of North Korea when he was detained in early 2016 and later charged and convicted with attempting to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel. He died six days after his release from North Korea due to a brain injury sustained while in custody. He was in a vegetative state when he returned home to his family near Cincinnati. Why Kim agreed to release Otto WarmbierLife sentence of hard labor Lim was sentenced to a lifetime of hard labor after he was convicted of crimes against the state in December 2015. He was detained in February 2015 while on a humanitarian mission in Rajin, North Korea, a family spokesperson said at the time. He was acting on behalf of the Light Korean Presbyterian Church. In a January 2016 interview with CNN in Pyongyang, the Canadian said he hadn't seen any other prisoners at the labor camp where he digs holes for eight hours a day, six days a week.", "time": "21:08:00"}

Sweden's embassy in Pyongyang, which represents several Western nations in the insular nation, had also helped, the statement said. \"Operational security considerations prevent us from discussing the matter further,\" it said. Lim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, had been sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 after North Korea accused him of attempting to overthrow the regime. [nL1N1KU1IV] \"Strategically, North Korea perhaps hopes to engender some goodwill from Canada as tensions rise,\" said Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China. \"They hope that Canada presents some moderating influence on the Trump administration. \"(But) I do not think it is directly connected to the tensions the U.S. president has ratcheted up. North Korea is concerned he would die in prison.\" North Korea has in the past attracted the attention of Washington and visits by high-profile Americans with the detention and release of U.S. citizens. KCNA said Lim had been released on \"sick bail\" by the country's Central Court for humanitarian reasons. Lim is expected to return to Canada later on Thursday and will be hospitalised on arrival at his wife's request, a source familiar with the matter said. His family is arriving separately. \"So far, it has been confirmed that government officials and a doctor are accompanying Reverend Lim,\" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak to media. Lim's family had become more concerned for his welfare since the death in June of American student Otto Warmbier, who had been held in North Korea for 17 months. Warmbier, sentenced last year to 15 years' hard labour for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel, died in a Cincinnati hospital days after being released in a coma. The circumstances of his death remain unclear. Canadian Senator Yonah Martin, who advocated for Lim's release, said Lim was hospitalised during his imprisonment. \"They were sending medication but there was a question as to whether he was actually receiving it in the way he should.\" North Korea is still holding three Americans. The U.S. State Department said last week it would ban U.S. nationals from travelling to the isolated country from September. Lim's Toronto-area church has said he visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labour camp where he had not seen any other prisoners. On Wednesday, North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump, unhappy with Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with \"fire and fury.\" (Additional reporting by Leah Schnurr in Ottawa, Ben Blanchard in Beijing, James Pearson in Seoul and Chris Arsenault in Toronto; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan) ((ben.blanchard@thomsonreuters.com; +86 10 6627 1201; Reuters Messaging: ben.blanchard.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: NORTHKOREA CANADA/ (UPDATE 4, TV, PIX)\n\nThis article appears in: Stocks , Politics", "time": "04:58:00"}

No other details were provided.\n\nLim, a pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga had been sentenced by a North Korean court to life in prison with hard labour for what it called crimes against the state.\n\nCharges against him included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans, and helping American and South Korean efforts to help people defect from the north.\n\nWord of Lim's release drew members of his congregation to their church, just west of Toronto, where they were seen hugging and crying Wednesday morning.\n\nCharles Baik, an associate pastor with the church's English ministry, said members are ecstatic at the prospect of Lim's return.\n\n\"We're so happy he's been released,\" Baik said from outside the church.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son living in the Toronto area, started the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly three decades ago, shortly after he emigrated from South Korea.\n\nHe grew the congregation from about a dozen people in 1986 to more than 3,000 members. He also runs a smaller church in downtown Toronto that caters to young people.\n\nThe church has taken on numerous humanitarian projects in North Korea, one of which prompted Lim's last trip there in January 2015.\n\nFamily and friends previously said he was visiting an orphanage, nursery and nursing home in the country at the time of his arrest. The pastor had successfully travelled to North Korea more than 100 times over the past two decades, they added.\n\nBaik said the pastor's ordeal would not deter the church from future humanitarian projects in the country.\n\n\"Missions will never stop, no matter where they may be,\" he said.\n\nFamily members had urged the Canadian government to put pressure on North Korea to secure Lim's release.\n\nTheir calls for action took on fresh urgency in June following the death of Otto Warmbier, an American student who lived only one week after being released from North Korean custody due to health concerns.\n\nLim's own health was of concern to his family members, who had said the pastor needed medication to manage his blood pressure.\n\nA Canadian delegation led by Daniel Jean, the national security adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, was in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang this week to discuss Lim's case.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office, told The Canadian Press on Tuesday.\n\nNeither Ahmad nor Global Affairs responded to request for comment on Lim's release.\n\nCanada does not have an embassy in North Korea, and has advised against all travel there.\n\nWith files from The Associated Press", "time": "17:58:00"}

His envoy achieved Canada's objective to secure the release of one of its citizens held in North Korea for the past two and a half years.\n\nState-controlled news agency KCNA announced Tuesday that North Korea's top court was releasing Toronto Presbyterian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim \"on sick bail\" for \"humanitarian\" reasons, as reported by Reuters.\n\nCanadian officials had notified Lim's son James over the weekend that the country would send a delegation to North Korea -- including Daniel Jean, the prime minister's national security adviser, and a doctor -- with a letter to North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un, a family spokesperson told CNN.\n\nDaily Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek delivered to your inbox\n\nThe Canadian delegation's arrival in Pyongyang was officially confirmed on Tuesday. \"[Lim's] health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government, and we are obviously continuing to engage on his case, and given that it is an active case, we cannot provide any further comment at this time,\" Trudeau's press secretary Cameron Ahmad told journalists.\n\nSouth Korea-born Canadian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim stands during his trial at a North Korean court in this undated photo released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang, North Korea, on December 16, 2015. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has sent a delegation to Pyongyang to discuss the pastor's release. KCNA/File Photo/Reuters\n\nNorth Korea sentenced the 62-year old pastor to hard labor for life in December 2015, after he was accused of attempting to overthrow Kim's regime. His family said he had been traveling to and from North Korea on humanitarian trips to establish orphanages, nurseries and nursing homes and had visited the country more than 100 times in the past 20 years.\n\nCNN interviewed the pastor in January 2016, finding he was forced to work eight hours a day, six days a week, in a camp where he had never seen another inmate. \"Nobody knows if I will ever go home, but that is my hope. I miss my family. I am longing to see them again, and my congregation,\" he told the American broadcaster.\n\nAfter the death of Otto Warmbier in June, an American citizen detained in North Korea and only released when he had already suffered brain damage, Trudeau has faced increased calls to pressure Pyongyang to free the Canadian minister.\n\nBut Lim isn't the only point of concern for Trudeau in dealing with North Korea, whose aim to develop nuclear missiles capable of reaching across the Pacific has Canadians worried they are in range. Trudeau addressed the concerns over Kim's ambitions and repeated missile tests in violation of U.N. rules in April.\n\n\"A nuclear power like North Korea that has shown a level of irresponsibility,\" he said, pausing for several seconds as he searched for the right words, finally continuing, \"fundamental irresponsibility -- to not to use a word like crazy, which I will not use -- is a real concern.\"\n\nHe then added, Canada would \"do whatever we can to ameliorate and defuse the situation with North Korea.\"", "time": "11:25:00"}

Two of them, Kim Hak-song and Kim Sang-dok, were detained earlier this year, while the third, Kim Dong-chul, was arrested in October 2015 and sentenced to 10 years of hard labor on charges of espionage and subversion.\n\nKenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary, served two years of detention in the North before being released in November 2014 when then-U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper made a secret trip to Pyongyang to win his release and that of another US detainee.\n\nSince 2009, over 10 US citizens have been detained in North Korea on charges of anti-state acts and other unspecified crimes. The widespread view has been that Pyongyang uses the detentions of Americans as bargaining chips in its negotiations with Washington.\n\nIn February 2017, the North Korean regime committed the murder of its leader Kim Jong-un's estranged half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, with a banned chemical weapon, the VX nerve agent, at Kuala Lumpur International Airport, according to Malaysia's auhtorities.\n\nNorth Korea's regime earlier on Wednesday threatened to \"contain\" the US bases on the island of Guam, and warned the United States it was ready for an \"all-out war\".\n\n'Subversive Plots'\n\nNorth Korea announced on Wednesday that it had released an imprisoned Canadian pastor \"for humanitarian reasons\", the Korea Central News Agency, the communist state's official media outlet, reported, as cited by South Korean news agency Yonhap.\n\nThe release of Korean-Canadian Lim Hyeon-su comes amid escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsular stemming from the North's continued provocations.\n\nAccording to the official announcement, the Canadian citizen was released on sick bail in line with the decision of the Central Court of North Korea.\n\nLim, a Korean-Canadian pastor, has been held in captivity since he entered the country via China on a humanitarian mission in January 2015.\n\nIn December, North Korea's highest court sentenced Lim to life in prison with hard labor, citing his \"subversive plots\" against the regime.\n\nHis release came one day after a special envoy of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, his National Security Adviser Daniel Jean, arrived in Pyongyang.\n\nThe visit drew speculation that the envoy was expected to persuade the Kim Jong-un to release the detained pastor.\n\nLim's family has been urging the Canadian government to step up efforts to release him after US college student Otto Warmbier was released by North Korea in a helpless condition in June, and died days after his medical evacuation to the US.\n\nLim has visited North Korea more than 100 times for humanitarian activities since 1997.", "time": "00:16:00"}

North Korea freed a Canadian pastor serving a life sentence on humanitarian grounds, the official KCNA news agency said on Wednesday, just hours after the United States warned it would counter any threat from the North with \"fire and fury.\"\n\nThere was no clear connection between the release of Hyeon Soo Lim and the heightened rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang. Canadian officials said on Tuesday a delegation led by the country's national security adviser had gone to North Korea to discuss Lim's case.\n\nLim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, had been sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 after North Korea accused him of attempting to overthrow the regime.\n\n\"Strategically, North Korea perhaps hopes to engender some goodwill from Canada as tensions rise,\" said Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China. \"They hope that Canada presents some moderating influence on the Trump administration.\n\n\"(But) I do not think it is directly connected to the tensions the U.S. president has ratcheted up. North Korea is concerned he would die in prison.\"\n\nKCNA said Lim had been released on \"sick bail\" by the country's Central Court for humanitarian reasons.\n\nLim is expected to return to Canada on Thursday and will be hospitalized on arrival at his wife's request, a source familiar with the matter said. His family is arriving separately.\n\n\"So far, it has been confirmed that government officials and a doctor are accompanying Reverend Lim,\" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to media.\n\nLim's family had become more concerned for his welfare since the death in June of American student Otto Warmbier, who had been held in North Korea for 17 months. Warmbier, sentenced last year to 15 years' hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel, died in a Cincinnati hospital days after being released in a coma. The circumstances of his death remain unclear.\n\nCanadian Senator Yonah Martin, who advocated for Lim's release, said Lim was hospitalized during his imprisonment.\n\n\"They were sending medication but there was a question as to whether he was actually receiving it in the way he should.\"\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office did not comment on Wednesday.\n\nNorth Korea has in the past attracted the attention of Washington and visits by high-profile Americans with the detention and release of U.S. citizens.\n\nNorth Korea is still holding three Americans. The U.S. State Department said last week it would ban U.S. nationals from traveling to the isolated country from September.\n\nLim's Toronto-area church has said he visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labor camp where he had not seen any other prisoners.\n\nOn Wednesday, North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump, unhappy with Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with \"fire and fury.\"\n\n(Story corrects in seventh paragraph, to show that Lim's family is arriving separately, not that the family is arriving with him.)\n\n(Additional reporting by Leah Schnurr in Ottawa, Ben Blanchard in Beijing and Chris Arsenault in Toronto; Editing by Bill Trott and James Dalgleish)\n\n(c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.

(AP)\n\nNorth Korea on Wednesday reportedly set free a Canadian pastor after the man became ill while serving a life sentence in the authoritarian regime.\n\nRim Hyon Su, also known as Hyeon Soo Lim, was arrested in 2015 and sentenced to hard labor after he allegedly attempted to overthrow the regime by using religion, according to CBC News.\n\nLim was convicted and sentenced in 2015 on charges of trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system and helping U.S. and South Korean authorities lure and abduct North Korean citizens.\n\nNAGASAKI MARKS ANNIVERSARY OF BOMBING AMID US-NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR TENSIONS\n\n\"Rim Hyon Su, a Canadian civilian was released on sick bail according to the decision of the Central Court of the DPRK on August 9, 2017, from the humanitarian viewpoint,\" the North Korean news agency KCNA told CBC News.\n\nLim, 62, had reportedly been in poor health and wrote letters to his friends stating he had stomach pain and high blood pressure. The pastor's family asked Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for help in securing Lim's release from the country.\n\nA Canadian security official arrived in North Korea Tuesday to secure the pastor's release.\n\n\"Obviously, Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada and we are continuing to engage on his case,\" Cameron Ahmad, Trudeau's spokesperson, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nNORTH KOREA, TRUMP RATCHET UP TENSION WITH THREATS OF 'FIRE' HOURS APART\n\nThe Toronto Presbyterian minister, who previously served at one of Canada's largest places of worship, held an interview with CNN in 2016 under the direction of North Korean officials. Lim said he had not witnessed any other prisoners where he was and he dug holes six days a week for eight hours a day as part of his punishment.\n\nThe release follows the June 13 release of Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student, who was held by North Korea for more than 17 months for allegedly stealing a propaganda poster. The student died less than a week later. There are three Americans still being held in North Korea.\n\nLim's release also comes as North Korea was threatening to bomb U.S. military bases on Guam. President Trump promised that the United States will unleash \"fire\" and \"fury.\" Earlier Tuesday, Fox News confirmed a report that said the DPRK produced a compact nuclear warhead that could fit on a missile capable of reaching the United States.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "time": "13:38:00"}

The North said earlier Wednesday it was considering a missile strike near US bases in Guam.\n\nThat comment came hours after US President Donald Trump threatened Pyongyang with \"fire and fury\" over its missile program.\n\nAt the time of Lim's arrest, other members of the close-knit circle of ethnic Korean missionaries in Canada and the United States called him one of the most influential Christian missionaries operating in North Korea.\n\nHe had visited the country dozens of times, working with orphanages and nursing homes.\n\nBut some projects he worked on, including a noodle plant and flour mills, were linked to associates of Jang Song-Thaek, the purged uncle of leader Kim Jong-Un.\n\nJang was arrested and executed for treason in December 2013.\n\nLim told CNN last year that he spent his days in prison digging holes. \"I wasn't originally a labourer so the labour was hard at first,\" he said, his head shaven.\n\nPyongyang views foreign missionaries with deep suspicion, though it allows some to undertake humanitarian work.\n\nA number of Christian missionaries - mostly ethnic Koreans who are US citizens - have been arrested in the past, with some of them only allowed to return home after intervention by high-profile US political figures. - Rappler.com", "time": "08:35:00"}

Family members will hold a press conference at his church in the Toronto suburb of Mississauga, family spokeswoman Lisa Pak said in a statement. Pak said it was not clear whether Pastor Lim, 62, would be at the press conference, but said he would attend church services on Sunday.\n\nLim, a leader of one of Canada's largest churches, had been sentenced to hard labor for life in December 2015 on charges of attempting to overthrow the North Korean regime. North Korea's KCNA news agency said on Wednesday that he was released on humanitarian grounds, though his family later said he was not in critical condition. Footage from Japan's ANN television showed Lim walking on a tarmac next to Canada's national security adviser, Daniel Jean, at the Yokota Air Base on the outskirts of Tokyo, in a stop en route to his home. Lim's return to Canada comes amid heightened tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, though there authorities have not said there is any connection.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: North korea", "time": "16:33:00"}

Lim had spent 2 \u00bd years in North Korea prison. He was released earlier this week.\n\nWhen Hyeon Soo Lim walked through the front doors of the Light Presbyterian Church and looked at a crowd he hadn't seen since he was taken captive in North Korea in early 2015, the room erupted into applause and chants of \"our pastor\" in Korean. Lim, dressed in a black suit and tie with his hair closely shorn, raised both hands and smiled. And the crowd yelled louder, craning for a photo or a glance of the pastor they had been praying for.\n\n\"I don't know what's going to happen,\" Junghwe Kim had said minutes before, positioning herself next to a potted tree in the hopes of taking a photo of the 62-year-old Lim. \"Oh my god,\" she said expectantly, clutching her phone and smiling, as all around her, people held hands and waited, giddy and excited. She talked of her prayers and her fears, and how happy she was that North Korea, which normally \"does everything bad,\" did a \"very good\" thing in releasing her pastor. \"I hope he's recovering.\"\n\nMore than an hour before Lim arrived, church members stared out the window at the parking lot where Lim was due to arrive, waving at the phalanx of photographers and reporters who stood underneath a banner with their pastor's smiling face and a message: \"Welcome home Rev. Lim\"\n\nAnna Shin, who has been praying for Lim since the church found out he was captured during mission work in North Korea in January 2015, said she was \"way too excited\" for Sunday's reunion with the congregation. She said the pastor is known for his sense of humour and his ability to connect with all ages.\n\nLim will not give the Sunday church service, but is expected to thank the congregation, according to church spokesperson Richard Ha.\n\nOutside the church before the service, Lim told a group of reporters that he's proud to be a Canadian.\n\n\"We are extremely happy,\" said Lim's son, James, addressing the media at the church on Saturday. \"We're ecstatic and joyful that my father is home. It was surreal in the beginning to witness my father coming off of an airplane after 2 \u00bd years.\"\n\nWhile he was in prison, Lim had only ever seen his not yet 1-year-old granddaughter in pictures, James Lim said. \"It's been amazing to see him hold my daughter for the first time.\"\n\nJames Lim said his father is in good health and is recovering after the \"ordeal.\"\n\nThe elder Lim arrived in Toronto in the morning hours on Saturday. A spokesperson wouldn't specify his route back to the city from North Korea.\n\n\"Everyone was excited when we heard the news\" that he was freed, said Sam Shim, operations manager at Lim's church, Saturday afternoon. \"There was crying, joyful crying.\"\n\nAfter Lim was detained he was sentenced to life in a labour camp, with the regime there saying he had been conducting subversive actions against leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"He loved North Korea,\" said Shim, adding that the congregation was \"shocked\" when Lim was detained.\n\nLim's charitable work in North Korea was focused on food security and sustainable farming, the younger Lim said at the news conference.\n\nNorth Korea's Central Court granted Lim \"sick bail\" on humanitarian grounds on Wednesday.\n\nSweden helped facilitate his release as Canada does not have an embassy in North Korea.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed Lim's freedom Thursday afternoon in a written statement: \"The Government of Canada was actively in engaged on Mr. Lim's case at all levels.

after more than two years in a North Korean prison say he is \"on his way home'' and they are anxious to be reunited with him.\n\nTORONTO -- An Ontario church congregation is celebrating news of the release of their pastor from a North Korean prison more than two years after he was arrested in the country.\n\nA decision from North Korea's central court freed Hyeon Soo Lim from the prison where he was serving a life sentence for anti-state activities, the country's Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday.\n\nThe pastor's release, which came on the heels of an official visit from a Canadian government delegation, was described as \"sick bail\" by the news agency. No other details were provided.\n\nIn a brief statement issued early Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was \"pleased and relieved\" that Lim had been released.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada, and we are working to ensure that he receives any required medical attention,\" said Trudeau.\n\nThe prime minister also thanked Sweden for its assistance in the matter but said \"operational security considerations\" prevents the government from discussing the matter further.\n\nLim, a pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga, Ont., had been sentenced by a North Korean court to life in prison with hard labour for what it called crimes against the state.\n\nCharges against him included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans, and helping American and South Korean efforts to help people defect from the north.\n\nWord of Lim's release drew members of his congregation to their church, just west of Toronto, where they were seen hugging and crying Wednesday morning.\n\nCharles Baik, an associate pastor with the church's English ministry, said members are ecstatic at the prospect of Lim's return.\n\n\"We're so happy he's been released, \" Baik said from outside the church.\n\nMissions will never stop, no matter where they may be.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son living in the Toronto area, started the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly three decades ago, shortly after he emigrated from South Korea.\n\nHe grew the congregation from about a dozen people in 1986 to more than 3,000 members. He also runs a smaller church in downtown Toronto that caters to young people.\n\nThe church has taken on numerous humanitarian projects in North Korea, one of which prompted Lim's last trip there in January 2015.\n\nFamily and friends previously said he was visiting an orphanage, nursery and nursing home in the country at the time of his arrest. The pastor had successfully travelled to North Korea more than 100 times over the past two decades, they added.\n\nBaik said the pastor's ordeal would not deter the church from future humanitarian projects in the country.\n\n\"Missions will never stop, no matter where they may be,\" he said.\n\nFamily members had urged the Canadian government to put pressure on North Korea to secure Lim's release.\n\nTheir calls for action took on fresh urgency in June following the death of Otto Warmbier, an American student who lived only one week after being released from North Korean custody due to health concerns.\n\nLim's own health was of concern to his family members, who had said the pastor needed medication to manage his blood pressure.\n\nA Canadian delegation led by Daniel Jean, the national security adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, was in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang this week to discuss Lim's case.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office, told The Canadian Press on Tuesday.\n\nNeither Ahmad nor Global Affairs responded to request for comment on Lim's release.\n\nCanada does not have an embassy in North Korea, and has advised against all travel there.", "time": "12:01:00"}

official media outlet, reported that Lim Hyeon-su, a Canadian civilian, was released on sick bail in line with the decision of the Central Court of the North.\n\nLim, a Korean-Canadian pastor, has been held in captivity in the North since he entered the country via China on a humanitarian mission in January 2015.\n\nIn December, the North's highest court sentenced Lim to life in prison with hard labor, citing his \"subversive plots\" against the North's regime.\n\nHis release came one day after a special envoy of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau arrived in the North.\n\nDaniel Jean, national security advisor to the prime minister of Canada, and his party arrived in Pyongyang, the KCNA reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe visit drew speculation that the envoy was to persuade the North to release the detained pastor.\n\nLim's family has been urging the Canadian government to step up efforts to release him after U.S. college student Otto Warmbier was released in a coma from

He was arrested in 2015 for allegedly meddling in North Korean state affairs.\n\nA court ordered Lim's release \"from the humanitarian viewpoint\", it said in a brief two-paragraph report.\n\nThe South Korean-born pastor had been accused of subversive acts against Pyongyang, an allegation which Canadian authorities strongly denied.\n\nA Canadian delegation including national security adviser Daniel Jean visited Pyongyang this week to discuss the case.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" said Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in Ottawa before the release.\n\nLim's family told local media they had become increasingly worried about his welfare since the death of American student Otto Warmbier in June.\n\nWarmbier, sentenced last year to 15 years' hard labour for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel during a tour, died in a Cincinnati hospital just days after being released in a coma. The circumstances of his death remain unclear.\n\nThree US citizens remain in custody as relations with Washington worsen sharply. The North said earlier Wednesday it was considering a missile strike near US bases in Guam.\n\nThat comment came hours after US President Donald Trump threatened Pyongyang with \"fire and fury\" over its missile program.\n\nAt the time of Lim's arrest, other members of the close-knit circle of ethnic Korean missionaries in Canada and the United States called him one of the most influential Christian missionaries operating in North Korea.\n\nHe had visited the country dozens of times, working with orphanages and nursing homes.\n\nBut some projects he worked on, including a noodle plant and flour mills, were linked to associates of Jang Song-Thaek, the purged uncle of leader Kim Jong-Un.\n\nJang was arrested and executed for treason in December 2013.\n\nLim told CNN last year that he spent his days in prison digging holes. \"I wasn't originally a laborer so the labor was hard at first,\" he said, his head shaven.\n\nPyongyang views foreign missionaries with deep suspicion, though it allows some to undertake humanitarian work.\n\nSouth Korea, the US and others often accuse North Korea of using foreign detainees to wrest diplomatic concessions, and foreigners have said after their release that their declarations of guilt had been coerced while in North Korean custody.\n\nA number of Christian missionaries -- mostly ethnic Koreans who are US citizens -- have been arrested in the past, with some of them only allowed to return home after intervention by high-profile US political figures.\n\nTrudeau's spokesman Cameron Ahmad said the government considered Lim's health of \"utmost importance\" but did not give more details about the delegation.\n\nCanada does not have diplomatic offices in Pyongyang and relies on Sweden to handle consular issues. Lim met with the Swedish ambassador at least twice this year and met Canadian officials in December.\n\nAsharq Al-Awsat English\n\nAsharq Al-Awsat is the world's premier pan-Arab daily newspaper, printed simultaneously each day on four continents in 14 cities.

His family has urged the Canadian Prime Minister to save his life.\n\nThe 62-year-old Canadian Korean pastor was arrested in 2015 and charged with harming the dignity of the supreme leadership and trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system.\n\nA Canadian government official said Jean was leading the delegation as Trudeau's special envoy, and while his focus was the release of Lim, he would also \"discuss other issues of regional concern\".\n\nThe Canadian delegation arrived on the same day US President Donald Trump warned that Pyongyang would be met \"with fire and fury and, frankly, power the likes of which the world has never seen before\", if it does not stop threatening the US.\n\nThe official said the timing of the delegation's visit was based on the condition of Lim, and not related to the increasing world pressure associated with Pyongyang's missile tests and last weekend's imposition of further sanctions by the UN.\n\n--IANS\n\npy/\n\nSEARCH", "time": "06:11:00"}

Then I was turned over to the Canadian delegation,'\" Park quoted Lim as telling him.\n\nLim's release, which was announced on Wednesday, came amid heightened tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, although authorities have not said there is any connection between his return and efforts to defuse the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program.\n\nLim's son James said at a Saturday news conference that the pastor was in \"good health\" but noted that the family planned to arrange for extended medical attention, including checkups.\n\n\"He is doing very well, considering everything he has gone through,\" he said.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "time": "16:51:00"}

The plane landed in the North Korean capital Monday.\n\nLim was serving a life sentence of hard labor after being convicted of crimes against the state in December 2015. The 62-year-old's health has deteriorated while in North Korean custody and the pastor has experienced \"dramatic\" weight loss, Pak said.\n\nLim's release comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula after US President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with \"fire and fury\" on Tuesday and Pyongyang said it was considering a military strike against the US territory of Guam.\n\nLim's family had stepped up calls for his release since the death of University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier in June.\n\nWarmbier was on a sightseeing tour of North Korea when he was detained in early 2016 and later charged with attempting to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel.\n\nHe died just six days after his release from North Korea due to a brain injury sustained while in custody. He was in a vegetative state when he returned home to his family near Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nThe US State Department has since announced a travel ban that will take effect next month, preventing nearly all US citizens from visiting North Korea, with the exception of journalists and humanitarian workers.\n\nWhy Kim agreed to release Otto Warmbier\n\nIn letters to family, friends, and members of his church in Mississauga, Ontario, Lim has complained of stomach pain and high blood pressure.\n\nHis family has not been allowed to see him during his imprisonment, but have been able to send him letters and blood pressure medication via the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang, which often serves as an intermediary for prisoners from nations with no formal diplomatic ties to North Korea.\n\n\"We are relieved to hear that Reverend Lim is on his way home to finally reunite with his family and meet his grand daughter for the first time,\" Pak said in statement to CNN.\n\n\"There is a long way to go in terms of Reverend Lim's healing. Therefore, in the meantime we ask the media for privacy as he reconnects with his loved ones and receives medical attention.\"\n\nThe family expressed gratitude to the Canadian, North Korean and Swedish governments.\n\n\"We want to thank the global community for the continued prayers and support and we also ask that the world does not forget the people of North Korea,\" the statement read.\n\nOpinion: How to put a stop to North Korea's brazen impunity\n\nLim detained in February 2015 while on a humanitarian mission in Rajin, North Korea, a family spokesperson said at the time. He was acting on behalf of the Light Korean Presbyterian Church, which he had led since 1986.\n\nAccording to his family, Lim has made more than 100 trips to North Korea since 1997, and his humanitarian efforts have included the founding by his church of a nursery, orphanage, and nursing home in the northeastern city of Rajin.\n\nIn a January 2016 interview with CNN in Pyongyang -- his first conversation with foreign media -- the Canadian said he was the sole prisoner in a labor camp, digging holes for eight hours a day, six days a week. At the time, he said he received regular medical care and three meals per day.\n\nAt least three US citizens remain in North Korean custody.\n\nBusinessman Kim Dong-chul was detained in October 2015 and is serving a 10-year sentence for espionage.\n\nKim Sang-duk, an academic also known as Tony Kim, was detained in April and is accused of \"hostile criminal acts,\" and researcher Kim Hak-song was detained in May and is also accused of \"hostile acts.\"", "time": "21:06:00"}

given.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, a spokeswoman for his family said \"there is a long way to go\" in terms of Lim's healing and stressed the need for privacy as he receives unspecified medical attention.\n\nLisa Pak also said the family is grateful to the Canadian government and the Swedish embassy in North Korea for working behind the scenes to secure the pastor's freedom. She did not say when he was scheduled to arrive in Canada.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday he was \"pleased and relieved\" that Lim had been released.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada, and we are working to ensure that he receives any required medical attention,\" Trudeau said in a brief statement.\n\nThe prime minister also thanked Sweden for its assistance in the matter but said \"operational security considerations\" prevent the government from discussing the matter further.\n\nA Canadian delegation led by Daniel Jean, Trudeau's national security adviser, was in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang this week to discuss Lim's case.\n\nLim, a pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga, Ont., had been sentenced by a North Korean court to life in prison with hard labour for what it called crimes against the state.\n\nCharges against him included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans, and helping American and South Korean efforts to help people defect from the north.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son living in the Toronto area, started the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly three decades ago, shortly after he emigrated from South Korea.\n\nHe grew the congregation from about a dozen people in 1986 to more than 3,000 members. He also runs a smaller church in downtown Toronto that caters to young people.\n\nThe church has taken on numerous humanitarian projects in North Korea, one of which prompted Lim's last trip there in January 2015.\n\nMembers of the congregation celebrated news of his release Wednesday.\n\n-- With files from The Associated Press", "time": "12:22:00"}

A Canadian pastor imprisoned in North Korea has been freed after two and a half years in detention.\n\nHyeon Soo Lim, North Korea's longest-held western prisoner in decades, was \"released on sick bail\" Wednesday by the country's top court for \"humanitarian\" reasons, state-run news agency KCNA said.\n\nLim's son, James Lim, received word over the weekend that a plane carrying senior Canadian officials, a medical doctor, and a letter to North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un was dispatched to Pyongyang \"at the last minute,\" according to family spokeswoman Lisa Pak. The plane landed in the North Korean capital Monday.\n\nLim was serving a life sentence of hard labor after being convicted of crimes against the state in December 2015. The 62-year-old's health has deteriorated while in North Korean custody and the pastor has experienced \"dramatic\" weight loss, Pak said.\n\nLim's release comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula after US President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with \"fire and fury\" on Tuesday and Pyongyang said it was considering a military strike against the US territory of Guam.\n\nLim's family had stepped up calls for his release since the death of University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier in June.\n\nWarmbier was on a sightseeing tour of North Korea when he was detained in early 2016 and later charged with attempting to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel.\n\nHe died just six days after his release from North Korea due to a brain injury sustained while in custody. He was in a vegetative state when he returned home to his family near Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nThe US State Department has since announced a travel ban that will take effect next month, preventing nearly all US citizens from visiting North Korea, with the exception of journalists and humanitarian workers.\n\nIn letters to family, friends, and members of his church in Mississauga, Ontario, Lim has complained of stomach pain and high blood pressure.\n\nHis family has not been allowed to see him during his imprisonment, but have been able to send him letters and blood pressure medication via the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang, which often serves as an intermediary for prisoners from nations with no formal diplomatic ties to North Korea.\n\n\"We are relieved to hear that Reverend Lim is on his way home to finally reunite with his family and meet his grand daughter for the first time,\" Pak said in statement to CNN.\n\n\"There is a long way to go in terms of Reverend Lim's healing. Therefore, in the meantime we ask the media for privacy as he reconnects with his loved ones and receives medical attention.\"\n\nThe family expressed gratitude to the Canadian, North Korean and Swedish governments.\n\n\"We want to thank the global community for the continued prayers and support and we also ask that the world does not forget the people of North Korea,\" the statement read.\n\nLim detained in February 2015 while on a humanitarian mission in Rajin, North Korea, a family spokesperson said at the time. He was acting on behalf of the Light Korean Presbyterian Church, which he had led since 1986.\n\nAccording to his family, Lim has made more than 100 trips to North Korea since 1997, and his humanitarian efforts have included the founding by his church of a nursery, orphanage, and nursing home in the northeastern city of Rajin.\n\nIn a January 2016 interview with CNN in Pyongyang -- his first conversation with foreign media -- the Canadian said he was the sole prisoner in a labor camp, digging holes for eight hours a day, six days a week. At the time, he said he received regular medical care and three meals per day.\n\nAt least three US citizens remain in North Korean custody.\n\nBusinessman Kim Dong-chul was detained in October 2015 and is serving a 10-year sentence for espionage.\n\nKim Sang-duk, an academic also known as Tony Kim, was detained in April and is accused of \"hostile criminal acts,\" and researcher Kim Hak-song was detained in May and is also accused of \"hostile acts.\"", "time": "10:28:00"}

Korean prison more than two years after he was arrested in the country.\n\nA decision from North Korea's central court freed Hyeon Soo Lim from the prison where he was serving a life sentence for anti-state activities, the country's Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday.\n\nThe pastor's release, which came on the heels of an official visit from a Canadian government delegation, was described as \"sick bail\" by the news agency. No other details were provided.\n\nLim, a pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga, Ont., had been sentenced by a North Korean court to life in prison with hard labour for what it called crimes against the state.\n\nCharges against him included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans, and helping American and South Korean efforts to help people defect from the north.\n\nWord of Lim's release drew members of his congregation to their church, just west of Toronto, where they were seen hugging and crying Wednesday morning.\n\nCharles Baik, an associate pastor with the church's English ministry, said members are ecstatic at the prospect of Lim's return.\n\n\"We're so happy he's been released, \" Baik said from outside the church.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son living in the Toronto area, started the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly three decades ago, shortly after he emigrated from South Korea.\n\nHe grew the congregation from about a dozen people in 1986 to more than 3,000 members.

Lim's son, James Lim, received word over the weekend that a plane carrying senior Canadian officials, a medical doctor, and a letter to North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un was dispatched to Pyongyang \"at the last minute,\" according to family spokeswoman Lisa Pak. The plane landed in the North Korean capital Monday.Lim was serving a life sentence of hard labor after being convicted of crimes against the state in December 2015. The 62-year-old's health has deteriorated while in North Korean custody and the pastor has experienced \"dramatic\" weight loss, Pak said. Lim's release comes amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula after US President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with \"fire and fury\" on Tuesday and Pyongyang said it was considering a military strike against the US territory of Guam. Read MorePrevious medical releaseLim's family had stepped up calls for his release since the death of American university student Otto Warmbier in June. Warmbier was on a sightseeing tour of North Korea when he was detained in early 2016 and later charged with attempting to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel. He died just six days after his release from North Korea due to a brain injury sustained while in custody. He was in a vegetative state when he returned home to his family near Cincinnati, Ohio.The US State Department has since announced a travel ban that will take effect next month, preventing nearly all US citizens from visiting North Korea, with the exception of journalists and humanitarian workers.Why Kim agreed to release Otto WarmbierIllness in captivityIn letters to family, friends, and members of his church in Mississauga, Ontario, Lim has complained of stomach pain and high blood pressure.His family has not been allowed to see him during his imprisonment, but have been able to send him letters and blood pressure medication via the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang, which often serves as an intermediary for prisoners from nations with no formal diplomatic ties to North Korea.\"We are relieved to hear that Reverend Lim is on his way home to finally reunite with his family and meet his grand daughter for the first time,\" Pak said in statement to CNN. \"There is a long way to go in terms of Reverend Lim's healing. Therefore, in the meantime we ask the media for privacy as he reconnects with his loved ones and receives medical attention.\"The family expressed gratitude to the Canadian, North Korean and Swedish governments.\"We want to thank the global community for the continued prayers and support and we also ask that the world does not forget the people of North Korea,\" the statement read.Opinion: How to put a stop to North Korea's brazen impunityHard laborLim detained in February 2015 while on a humanitarian mission in Rajin, North Korea, a family spokesperson said at the time. He was acting on behalf of the Light Korean Presbyterian Church, which he had led since 1986.According to his family, Lim has made more than 100 trips to North Korea since 1997, and his humanitarian efforts have included the founding by his church of a nursery, orphanage, and nursing home in the northeastern city of Rajin.In a January 2016 interview with CNN in Pyongyang -- his first conversation with foreign media -- the Canadian said he was the sole prisoner in a labor camp, digging holes for eight hours a day, six days a week. At the time, he said he received regular medical care and three meals per day. Left behindAt least three US citizens remain in North Korean custody. Businessman Kim Dong-chul was detained in October 2015 and is serving a 10-year sentence for espionage. Kim Sang-duk, an academic also known as Tony Kim, was detained in April and is accused of \"hostile criminal acts,\" and researcher Kim Hak-song was detained in May and is also accused of \"hostile acts.\"", "time": "11:33:00"}

\"operational security considerations prevent us from discussing the matter further\" - but noted the role of Daniel Jean, his national security adviser, and Sweden.\n\n\"The government of Canada was actively engaged on Mr. Lim's case at all levels,\" Mr. Trudeau said.\n\n\"In particular, I want to thank Sweden, our protecting power in North Korea, for assisting us,\" he added.\n\n\"This week, a Canadian government delegation led by Daniel Jean, my special envoy, travelled to Pyongyang, North Korea, to discuss Pastor Lim's case. Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada, and we are working to ensure that he receives any required medical attention.\"\n\nMr. Lim's release comes at a time when Pyongyang is at the centre of high-pitched international tension over its nuclear-missile program that has dominated attention from Washington to Beijing.\n\nIt's unclear whether the international tensions swirling around North Korea had any effect on the case of Mr. Lim, about whom family and friends were growing increasingly worried.\n\nIt's possible that Mr. Lim's release might be North Korea's way of sending a goodwill message at a time of high tension, to try to portray itself as a reasonable country that can negotiate, said Steven Denney, a doctoral fellow at the Munk School of Global Affairs' Asian Institute.\n\n\"I think that North Korea understood that it was on thinner ice than usual,\" he said, after the case of Otto Warmbier, an American University student who fell into a coma while imprisoned in North Korea - he was released June 13, but died six days later. It's possible the regime is being more cautious with Mr. Lim's health problems, Mr. Denney said.\n\nPyongyang had reason to avoid a repeat of what happened to Mr. Warmbier.\n\n\"That incident met with major U.S. and international backlash against North Korea. It catalyzed discussions over additional human-rights-focused sanctions and prompted countries to re-evaluate their policies on tourism to the North,\" said Andrea Berger, senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump set a confrontational tone Tuesday, when he said the United States would respond to North Korean threats \"with fire and fury the world has never seen.\"\n\nThat heightened speculation the United States was moving toward war with North Korea, though U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to dial back the fears of imminent military conflict as he flew to Guam on Wednesday.\n\nHe told reporters that Mr. Trump was sending \"a strong message to North Korea in language that [North Korean leader] Kim Jong-un would understand.\" Even so, the United States has in recent weeks delivered a steady drumbeat of warnings to Pyongyang that it must stand down from its pursuit of functional warheads for long-range nuclear missiles.There has also been tension between Washington and China, as Mr. Trump repeatedly pressed Beijing to use its influence to rein in its neighbour.\n\nChina signalled what could be a major shift by casting a United Nations Security Council vote on Saturday to impose sanctions on North Korea. If China enforces those sanctions, it would have a major impact on its neighbour, as most of North Korea's trade goes through China. The UN vote appeared to mark a new willingness by Beijing to openly pressuring its neighbour with punitive measures.\n\nChina's influence has always been crucial in diplomacy with North Korea - few other countries have functioning relationships with Pyongyang. Canada has no direct diplomatic relations with Pyongyang, but Mr. Trudeau's Liberal government is actively working to warm political and economic ties with Beijing. Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland was in China on Wednesday for formal talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, arriving after Mr. Jean and the delegation were already in North Korea.\n\nJack Kim, special adviser to HanVoice, a Canadian non-profit organization that advocates for North Korean human rights, said it is not clear if there was a quid pro quo between Canada and North Korea for Mr. Lim's release. However, he said Mr. Jean's visit to Pyongyang may have been enough for the North Koreans.\n\n\"What they usually want is a high-profile official going to North Korea. ... Daniel Jean, in the Canadian sense, does fit that bill,\" Mr. Kim said. \"It's kind of a show of respect to the North Korean regime that these foreign officials are coming to fetch these incarcerated folks out.\"\n\nMr. Kim said the government's decision to send Mr. Jean - as opposed to a sitting legislator or even a cabinet minister - to Pyongyang was a \"good compromise\" in an effort to not give into the North Koreans.\n\nMr. Lim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada and travelled to North Korea regularly on humanitarian missions, was sentenced by the country's Supreme Court in December, 2015, to a lifetime of hard labour after being accused of attempting to overthrow the regime.\n\nIn his early 60s, Mr. Lim is said to suffer from high blood pressure and is believed to have lost a significant amount of weight since his capture.\n\nMr. Lim's family had become more concerned for his welfare since the death of Mr. Warmbier, who had been held in North Korea for 17 months.\n\nMr. Warmbier, sentenced last year to 15 years' hard labour for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel during a tour, died in a Cincinnati hospital just days after being released in a coma. The circumstances of his death remain unclear.\n\nStaff and members of Mississauga's Light Korean Presbyterian Church had long been praying for Mr. Lim's release and well-being. Assistant pastor John Bae arrived Wednesday morning for 5:30 prayers and found out Mr. Lim had been let go an hour later.\n\n\"We were praying so hard for good news,\" he told The Globe and Mail shortly after removing a \"Bring Lim Home\" sign from his office door. \"We're thankful for the Canadian government's work.\"\n\nRaymond Cho, a Progressive Conservative member of the Ontario legislature who has known Mr. Lim for 20 years, said he has not heard any official word about the pastor's release but believes failing health played a major factor.\n\n\"His health must be pretty bad, I suspect,\" Mr. Cho said before Mr. Trudeau's comments Thursday.\n\nMr. Cho said North Korea could be trying to \"save face\" in the international community by releasing Mr. Lim.\n\n\"I don't think it will help if [Mr. Lim] becomes any more sick and dies there. At this stage, North Korea is getting more and more isolated after this continued missile testing and the nuclear-arms program,\" he said.\n\n\"Whatever the reason, I'm exceedingly happy he's coming home.\"\n\nConservative Senator Yonah Martin, who is ethnically Korean, had previously lobbied for Mr. Lim to be freed. \"I'm relieved,\" she said, following the news of Mr. Lim's release.\n\nShe said Mr. Warmbier's death had been a \"catalyst\" for the release of the Canadian pastor.\n\nMs. Martin said Mr. Lim had lost more than 20 kilograms. Last year, Mr. Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labour camp where he had not seen any other prisoners.\n\nHis family had sent him needed medication but was worried he was not receiving it. A letter sent by Mr. Lim to his family further raised concern that he was unwell.\n\n\"The tone in the letter,\" Ms. Martin said, gave \"the sense that his health was definitely being affected.\n\n\"How could it not? Being away from family, away for such a long period of time after being isolated, being under watch and under hard labour in North Korea.\"", "time": "10:31:00"}

prison more than two years after he was arrested in the country.\n\nA decision from North Korea's central court freed Hyeon Soo Lim from the prison where he was serving a life sentence for anti-state activities, the country's Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday.\n\nThe pastor's release, which came on the heels of an official visit from a Canadian government delegation, was described as \"sick bail\" by the news agency. No other details were provided.\n\nLim, a pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga, Ont., had been sentenced by a North Korean court to life in prison with hard labour for what it called crimes against the state.\n\nCharges against him included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans, and helping American and South Korean efforts to help people defect from the north.\n\nWord of Lim's release drew members of his congregation to their church, just west of Toronto, where they were seen hugging and crying Wednesday morning.\n\nCharles Baik, an associate pastor with the church's English ministry, said members are ecstatic at the prospect of Lim's return.\n\n\"We're so happy he's been released, \" Baik said from outside the church.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son living in the Toronto area, started the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly three decades ago, shortly after he emigrated from South Korea.\n\nHe grew the congregation from about a dozen people in 1986 to more than 3,000 members. He also runs a smaller church in downtown Toronto that caters to young people.\n\nThe church has taken on numerous humanitarian projects in North Korea, one of which prompted Lim's last trip there in January 2015.\n\nFamily and friends previously said he was visiting an orphanage, nursery and nursing home in the country at the time of his arrest. The pastor had successfully travelled to North Korea more than 100 times over the past two decades, they added.\n\nBaik said the pastor's ordeal would not deter the church from future humanitarian projects in the country.\n\n\"Missions will never stop, no matter where they may be,\" he said.\n\nFamily members had urged the Canadian government to put pressure on North Korea to secure Lim's release.\n\nTheir calls for action took on fresh urgency in June following the death of Otto Warmbier, an American student who lived only one week after being released from North Korean custody due to health concerns.\n\nLim's own health was of concern to his family members, who had said the pastor needed medication to manage his blood pressure.\n\nA Canadian delegation led by Daniel Jean, the national security adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, was in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang this week to discuss Lim's case.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office, told The Canadian Press on Tuesday.\n\nNeither Ahmad nor Global Affairs responded to request for comment on Lim's release.\n\nCanada does not have an embassy in North Korea, and has advised against all travel there.", "time": "20:45:00"}

North Korean prison where he spent the last two years, according to his family and the prime minister.\n\nNorth Korea's official KCNA news agency announced Hyeon Soo Lim's release Wednesday, saying he was freed on \"sick bail.\"\n\nThe announcement came after a Canadian government delegation led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's national security advisor Daniel Jean traveled to Pyongyang to discuss the 62-year-old's case.\n\n\"We are relieved to hear that Reverend Lim is on his way home to finally reunite with his family and meet his grand daughter for the first time,\" Lisa Pak, a spokeswoman for the family, said in a statement.\n\nShe said the family was \"relieved, grateful, excited, and anxious to see him home.\"\n\nPak also thanked Canadian officials who \"worked behind the scenes with North Korean authorities\" to secure his release, as well as Swedish diplomats who assisted them.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement that he was \"pleased and relieved\" to confirm Lim's release, adding that Lim would \"soon be reunited with his family and friends in Canada.\"\n\nLim was arrested in 2015 for allegedly meddling in North Korean state affairs.\n\nThe South Korean-born pastor had been accused of subversive acts against Pyongyang, an allegation Canadian authorities strongly denied.\n\nLim's family had become increasingly worried about his welfare since the death of American student Otto Warmbier in June, just days after he had been released from a North Korean prison.\n\nThree US citizens remain in custody as relations with Washington have grown increasingly tense. The North said Wednesday it was considering a missile strike near US bases in Guam.\n\nThat comment came hours after US President Donald Trump threatened Pyongyang with \"fire and fury\" over its missile program.\n\nLim last year told CNN he spent his days in prison digging holes at an orchard. \"I wasn't originally a laborer so the labor was hard at first,\" he said, his head shaven.\n\nPak said Lim has \"a long way to go in terms of... healing.\"\n\nTrudeau said Lim's \"health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada, and we are working to ensure that he receives any required medical attention.\"", "time": "11:50:00"}

life sentence with hard labour in North Korea for anti-state activities says his father will worship with his congregation on Sunday morning, following a day of rest and reunion with his family.\n\n\"It was surreal from the beginning to witness my father coming off an airplane after two-and-a-half years,\" James Lim told reporters at a press conference on Saturday. \"His faith has grown stronger.\"\n\nHyeon Soo Lim, 62, landed in Ontario on Saturday morning, according to the family's spokesperson Lisa Pak. He had not seen his relatives in person since his 2015 arrest on a missionary trip where he is said to have been mainly working to improve food security within the insular communist state.\n\nNorth Korean authorities freed Hyeon Soo Lim earlier this week. A six-member Canadian diplomatic envoy travelled to Pyongyang to help secure his release.\n\nJames Lim said his father first embraced his mother, and then went straight towards his infant granddaughter, who was born while he was imprisoned, when the family was reunited.\n\n\"It was just incredible. Just to see two people that I love more than anybody else in the world finally meet and embrace,\" James Lim said. \"You play in your head many times what that moment is going to be like. It's far greater than anything you could have imagined.\"\n\nPak said the family still does not know why North Korean authorities released Hyeon Soo Lim, or what led to his arrest. She estimates the pastor travelled to the country over 110 times to do similar work over the course of two decades.\n\n\"My best guess is that they were concerned about his health, and so they released him,\" Pak said.\n\nJames Lim said the family relied heavily on their Christian values and never gave up hope during Hyeon Soo Lim's imprisonment. He said watching his father's taped confession on North Korean state television and the death of U.S. university student Otto Warmbier tested the family's faith.\n\nWarmbier spent 17 months in a North Korean prison for allegedly taking a propaganda poster. He fell into a coma, and was medically evacuated to the U.S. on June 13. Warmbier died days later.\n\n\"The thing that we were really concerned about was the terrible and unfortunate passing of Otto Warmbier. That was unprecedented,\" James Lim said. \"That placed a huge amount of not only burden, but urgency to push the government.\"\n\nJames Lim said his father is grateful to Canadian officials for their efforts to bring him home, adding that he is generally in good spirit and health.

Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labour camp where he had not seen any other prisoners.\n\nOn Wednesday, North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with \"fire and fury\".\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "time": "12:19:00"}

An Ontario church congregation is celebrating news of the release of their pastor from a North Korean prison more than two years after he was arrested in the country.\n\nA decision from North Korea's central court freed Hyeon Soo Lim from the prison where he was serving a life sentence for anti-state activities, the country's Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday.\n\nThe pastor's release, which came on the heels of an official visit from a Canadian government delegation, was described as \"sick bail\" by the news agency. No other details were provided.\n\nLim, a pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga, Ont., had been sentenced by a North Korean court to life in prison with hard labour for what it called crimes against the state.\n\nCharges against him included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans, and helping American and South Korean efforts to help people defect from the north.\n\nWord of Lim's release drew members of his congregation to their church, just west of Toronto, where they were seen hugging and crying Wednesday morning.\n\nCharles Baik, an associate pastor with the church's English ministry, said members are ecstatic at the prospect of Lim's return.\n\n\"We're so happy he's been released, \" Baik said from outside the church.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son living in the Toronto area, started the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly three decades ago, shortly after he emigrated from South Korea.\n\nHe grew the congregation from about a dozen people in 1986 to more than 3,000 members. He also runs a smaller church in downtown Toronto that caters to young people.\n\nThe church has taken on numerous humanitarian projects in North Korea, one of which prompted Lim's last trip there in January 2015.\n\nFamily and friends previously said he was visiting an orphanage, nursery and nursing home in the country at the time of his arrest. The pastor had successfully travelled to North Korea more than 100 times over the past two decades, they added.\n\nBaik said the pastor's ordeal would not deter the church from future humanitarian projects in the country.\n\n\"Missions will never stop, no matter where they may be,\" he said.\n\nFamily members had urged the Canadian government to put pressure on North Korea to secure Lim's release.\n\nTheir calls for action took on fresh urgency in June following the death of Otto Warmbier, an American student who lived only one week after being released from North Korean custody due to health concerns.\n\nLim's own health was of concern to his family members, who had said the pastor needed medication to manage his blood pressure.\n\nA Canadian delegation led by Daniel Jean, the national security adviser to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, was in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang this week to discuss Lim's case.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office, told The Canadian Press on Tuesday.\n\nNeither Ahmad nor Global Affairs responded to request for comment on Lim's release.\n\nCanada does not have an embassy in North Korea, and has advised against all travel there.", "time": "18:09:00"}

the official KCNA news agency said.\n\nHyeon Soo Lim, 61, was freed on \"sick bail\", the agency announced after a Canadian government delegation arrived in Pyongyang to discuss the case.\n\nA court ordered Lim's release \"from the humanitarian viewpoint\", it said in a brief two-paragraph report.\n\nLim was arrested in 2015 for allegedly meddling in North Korean state affairs.\n\nThe South Korean-born pastor had been accused of subversive acts against Pyongyang, an allegation which Canadian authorities strongly denied.\n\nA Canadian delegation, including the national security adviser Daniel Jean, visited Pyongyang this week to discuss the case.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and wellbeing remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case,\" said Cameron Ahmad, a spokesman for the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, in Ottawa before the release.\n\nLim's family told local media they had become increasingly worried about his welfare since the death of the American student Otto Warmbier in June, just days after he had been released from a North Korean prison.\n\nThree US citizens remain in custody as relations with Washington worsen

North Korea freed a Canadian pastor serving a life sentence there on humanitarian grounds, the official KCNA news agency said on Wednesday, just hours after the United States warned it would counter any threat from the North with \"fire and fury\".\n\nThe release came a day after Canadian officials said a delegation led by the country's national security adviser had travelled to North Korea to discuss the case of Hyeon Soo Lim, sentenced to hard labour for life in December 2015.\n\nNorth Korea had accused Lim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, of attempting to overthrow the regime.\n\n\"Rim Hyon Su, a Canadian civilian, was released on sick bail according to the decision of the Central Court of the DPRK on August 9, 2017, from the humanitarian viewpoint,\" KCNA said, using the country's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\nThere was no obvious direct connection between the release and the standoff with the United States, but North Korea has in the past attracted the attention of Washington, and visits by high-profile Americans, with the detention and release of U.S. citizens.\n\nLim's family had become more concerned for his welfare since the death in June of American student Otto Warmbier, who had been held in North Korea for 17 months.\n\nWarmbier, sentenced last year to 15 years' hard labour for trying to steal a propaganda item from his hotel during a tour, died in a Cincinnati hospital just days after being released in a coma. The circumstances of his death remain unclear.\n\nNorth Korea is still holding three Americans. The U.S. State Department said last week it would ban U.S. nationals from travelling to the isolated country, beginning in September.\n\nLim's Toronto-area church has said he visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labour camp where he had not seen any other prisoners.\n\nOn Wednesday, North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after President Donald Trump told the North that any threat to the United States would be met with \"fire and fury\".

Other countries should also strictly forbid their citizens from entering the country. In particular, humanitarian workers should stay away from North Korea as long as it continues to infringe upon the rights of foreign visitors.\n\nThe release of the Canadian pastor has also renewed attention to Korean captives.

spent the last two years, according to his family and the prime minister.\n\nNorth Korea's official KCNA news agency announced Hyeon Soo Lim's release Wednesday, saying he was freed on \"sick bail.\"\n\nThis came after a Canadian government delegation led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's national security advisor Daniel Jean traveled to Pyongyang to discuss the 62-year-old's case.\n\n\"We are relieved to hear that Reverend Lim is on his way home to finally reunite with his family and meet his granddaughter for the first time,\" Lisa Pak, a spokeswoman for the family, said in a statement.\n\nShe said the family was \"relieved, grateful, excited, and anxious to see him home.\"\n\nPak also thanked Canadian officials who \"worked behind the scenes with North Korean authorities\" to secure his release, as well as Swedish diplomats who assisted them.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement that he was \"pleased and relieved\" to confirm Lim's release, adding that Lim would \"soon be reunited with his family and friends in Canada.\"\n\nLim was arrested in 2015 for allegedly meddling in North Korean state affairs.\n\nThe South Korean-born pastor had been accused of subversive acts against Pyongyang, an allegation Canadian authorities strongly denied.\n\nLim's family became increasingly worried about his welfare after the death of American student Otto Warmbier in June, days after he had been released from a North Korean prison.\n\nThree US citizens remain in custody as tensions with Washington have sharpened. The North said Wednesday it was considering a missile strike near US bases in Guam.\n\nThat comment came hours after US President Donald Trump threatened Pyongyang with \"fire and fury\" over its missile program.\n\nLim last year told CNN he spent his days in prison digging holes at an orchard. \"I wasn't originally a laborer so the labor was hard at first,\" he said, his head shaven.\n\nPak said Lim has \"a long way to go in terms of... healing.\"\n\nTrudeau said Lim's \"health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada, and we are working to ensure that he receives any required medical attention.\"\n\nAt the time of Lim's arrest, other members of the close-knit circle of ethnic Korean missionaries in Canada and the United States called him one of the most influential Christian missionaries operating in North Korea.\n\nHe had visited the country dozens of times, working with orphanages and nursing homes.\n\nBut some projects he worked on, including a noodle plant and flour mills, were linked to associates of Jang Song-Thaek, the purged uncle of leader Kim Jong-Un.\n\nJang was arrested and executed for treason in December 2013.\n\nPyongyang views foreign missionaries with deep suspicion, though it allows some to undertake humanitarian work.\n\nA number of Christian missionaries -- mostly ethnic Koreans who are US citizens -- have been arrested in the past, with some of them only allowed to return home after intervention by high-profile US political figures.", "time": "13:13:00"}

Pyongyang by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's national security advisor Daniel Jean\n\nA Canadian pastor imprisoned in North Korea for more than two years returned home Saturday days after being released, officials said.\n\nHyeon Soo Lim, 62, was arrested in January 2015 on charges of subversive activities against the North Korean regime, an accusation denied by Ottawa.\n\nAlthough sentenced to hard labor for life, he was granted \"sick bail\" following a visit to Pyongyang by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's national security advisor Daniel Jean.\n\n\"Today, we join Pastor Lim's family and congregation in celebrating his long-awaited return to Canada,\" the foreign affairs ministry said in a press statement.\n\n\"Canada has been actively engaged on Mr. Lim's case at all levels, and we will continue to support him and his family now that he has returned,\" it added.\n\nAccording to local media reports, Lim was flown to a military base in Trenton, some 170 kilometers (100 miles) east of Toronto.\n\nHis liberation came at a moment of high tensions between North Korea and the United States. Three Americans remain in the custody of the regime of Kim Jong-Un.\n\nPyongyang has threatened to launch missiles on the island Guam, a strategic US outpost in the Pacific some 3,300 kilometers (2000 miles) from North Korea.\n\nUS President Donald Trump for his part as promised to rain down \"fire and fury\" on Kim's regime.\n\nLim, who belongs to the Light Korean Presbyterian Church, was considered at the time of his arrest one of the most influential Christian missionaries in North Korea.\n\nHe had previously traveled extensively in the country to work in orphanages and hospitals.\n\nBut some projects he worked on, including a noodle plant and flour mills, were linked to associates of Jang Song-Thaek, the purged uncle of leader Kim.\n\nJang was arrested and executed for treason in December 2013.", "time": "00:57:00"}

in Mississauga, which has wept, prayed and organized vigils for their pastor during the 2 \u00bd years he was detained in North Korea.\n\nOn Saturday, Hyeon Soo Lim will be reunited with his family in Toronto.\n\nAnd on Sunday, Lim will return to his church family -- the congregation of the Light Presbyterian Church in Mississauga, which has wept, prayed and organized vigils for their beloved senior pastor during the 2 \u00bd years he was detained in North Korea.\n\nThe reception for Lim is expected to pack the 2,000-seat facility where Lim used to preach weekly.\n\nLim's family is requesting privacy but their reaction to his freedom was \"relieved, grateful, excited and anxious to see him home,\" according to church spokesperson Richard Ha.\n\nLim has been able to phone church colleagues, who say he is doing well.\n\n\"He is in good spirits,\" said Jason Noh, an associate pastor at the Light Presbyterian Church.\n\nIn video footage taken Thursday by a Japanese television crew, Lim is on the tarmac of a U.S. military base in Fussa, Japan. His hair is shorn, he looks thinner but appears to be smiling and walking unaided with the Canadian delegation, led by Justin Trudeau's national security adviser, Daniel Jean.\n\nThe delegation reportedly flew to Japan from Pyongyang after North Korea's Central Court on Wednesday granted Lim \"sick bail\" on humanitarian grounds.\n\nThe delegation did not head straight home. The group jetted to Guam for a layover, according to sources. The return flight path is not known but Lim was expected to be in Toronto by Saturday.\n\nIn January 2015, Lim was detained by North Korean authorities while on a charitable mission to the country's northern region. Later that year, the pastor was convicted of attempting to subvert the authoritarian regime of Kim Jong Un and was sentenced to life in a labour camp.\n\nTrudeau confirmed Lim's freedom in a statement sent out by email at 1:13 a.m. Thursday. It read, in part: \"The Government of Canada was actively engaged on Mr. Lim's case at all levels. In particular, I want to thank Sweden, our protecting power in North Korea, for assisting us.\"\n\nThe Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang serves as Canada's protecting power in North Korea because Ottawa does not have an embassy there. Swedish ambassador Torkel Stiernl\u00f6f was able to meet with Lim a few times and, with North Korean approval, delivered family letters and prescription medication to him. Lim has high blood pressure that requires medicine.\n\nOn July 14, the North Korean state news agency reported that authorities had arranged a meeting between an unnamed Swedish embassy official and Lim \"on the basis of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and in the humanitarian spirit.\"\n\nIt has been reported that Lim was in poor health and had lost a lot of weight.\n\nAccording to English-language reports citing the Korean Central News Agency article, Lim asked the Swedish diplomat in that July 14 meeting \"to convey his request to the Canadian government for making active efforts to settle his issue.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Global Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland wrote to thank her Swedish counterpart, Margot Wallstrom, on her Twitter account: \"Thank you for your tremendous support, @MargotWallstrom. Canadians are so grateful for #Sweden's long-standing, heartfelt friendship.\"\n\nIn Toronto, it's expected Lim's wife, Geum, their son James, his wife and 10-month-old daughter will be waiting for him. James, 34, and his family live in the United States. Geum Lim has spent a good deal of time in Seoul during her husband's detention and imprisonment.\n\nAll three Lims are natives of South Korea. The family immigrated to Canada, settling in Toronto, in 1986 when Lim had the opportunity to study at the University of Toronto's Knox College.", "time": "23:29:00"}

A plane carrying medical personnel, senior Canadian officials, and a letter to Kim Jong-un were sent to Pyongyang.

The North has said, however, that its doors remain open to any American citizens interested in visiting the country.\n\nTensions between North Korea and the U.S. are on the rise, as North Korea has threatened to take punitive action against the U.S. in response to new sanctions, as well as other perceived provocations.

North Korea also accused Hyeon of trying to overthrow the Kim regime using religion and was eventually sentenced to hard labour for life.\n\nHowever, Toronto rejected all the allegations against Hyeon, who served at one of the largest churches in Canada.\n\nA delegation led by Canada's national security adviser and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's intelligence adviser, Daniel Jean, is now reported to be negotiating with North Korean officials to secure the pastor's release.\n\n\"A Canadian government delegation is currently in Pyongyang, DPRK, to discuss Pastor Lim's case,\" AFP news agency cited Trudeau spokesman Cameron Ahmad as saying, referring to North Korea's official name.\n\nThis is reported to be the second time in about nine months that a top Canadian official has been sent to Pyongyang to secure the release of Hyeon, the last time being in December 2016.\n\n\"His health and wellbeing remain of utmost importance to the government and we are obviously continuing to engage on his case and, given that it is an active case, we cannot provide any further comment at this time,\" the spokesman added.\n\nThe 62-year-old pastor is reported to be in poor health now, suffering from high blood pressure and had earlier complained of stomach pain.\n\nAccording to local media reports, Hyeon's family has become very concerned over the pastor's well-being since the death of Otto Warmbier in June.\n\nNorth Korea released 22-year-old American student Warmbier, who had like Hyeon been detained for his alleged involvement in subversive acts, on 13 June on \"humanitarian grounds\". He was medically evacuated to the US on a military plane the following day after serving prison in North Korea for 17 months. But his family said he arrived in a state of coma, and eventually died on 19 June.\n\nHyeon had visited the isolated nation dozens of times to help set up and work with orphanages and nursing homes. At the time of his arrest, he was called by his kith and kin as one of the most influential Christian missionaries operating in North Korea.\n\nThe pastor was reportedly involved in projects linked to some associates of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un's purged uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who was executed in 2013 for treason.\n\nIn an interview with CNN last year, the pastor said he usually spends eight hours a day digging holes in the prison where he has apparently not seen any other inmates.", "time": "11:52:00"}

Lim Hyeon-soo, a South Korea-born pastor of the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Toronto, received his penalty in December 2015, when North Korea's Supreme Court convicted him of carrying out \"subversive plots\" and committing \"activities against\" the country, like harming the dignity of the supreme leadership of Kim Jong-un.\n\nMr. Lim was released on Wednesday, when the same court decided to free him on sick bail, the North's official Korean Central News Agency said. The agency's one-sentence dispatch gave no further detail.\n\nThe release of Mr. Lim came two months after an American college student, Otto F. Warmbier, died shortly after he was freed from North Korea while in a coma. Mr. Warmbier, 22, was serving a sentence of 15 years of hard labor for trying to steal a political poster from a Pyongyang hotel.\n\nHis death angered many Americans and eventually convinced the State Department to ban Americans from visiting North Korea.\n\nMr. Lim, who had visited North Korea more than 100 times on what his church called humanitarian missions, lost contact with his congregation after entering the country in early 2015. A tearful Mr. Lim later appeared in a government-arranged news conference in Pyongyang and confessed to plotting to overthrow the North Korean leadership by undermining the \"worship\" of Kim Jong-un.\n\nHis church had supported a nursing home, a nursery and an orphanage in North Korea since it began a mission there in 1996, when the country was in the grip of a famine that killed thousands of people.\n\nMr. Lim said during his news conference that the bags of food he had donated across North Korea had carried the sign of the cross and phrases from the Bible. North Korean prosecutors also accused him of helping \"lure and abduct\" North Korean citizens, calling them defectors.\n\nNorth Korea, which zealously tries to shield its citizens from outside influences, has detained several foreign missionaries in recent years, calling them spies or agents of subversive ideas.\n\nKenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for trying to establish a secret proselytizing network, was freed in 2014, after the United States government sent its director of national intelligence, James R. Clapper Jr., to North Korea.\n\nDuring his detention or trial, Mr. Lim's family members were not allowed to visit him, and appealed repeatedly to North Korea to free him.", "time": "14:12:00"}

62-year-old pastor and humanitarian worker who suffers from high blood pressure was released for health reasons.\n\nLim, who had visited North Korea dozens of times since 1997, was serving a life sentence of hard labour after he was arrested and convicted in 2015 of \"crimes against the state.\"\n\n\"Today, I am pleased and relieved to confirm that Pastor Lim has been released from jail in North Korea and that he will soon be reunited with his family and friends in Canada,\" Trudeau said in a statement released early Thursday morning.\n\n\"The Government of Canada was actively engaged on Mr. Lim's case at all levels.

The two countries established diplomatic relations in 2001.\n\nHowever, following North Korea's aggressive actions in 2010, including the sinking of a South Korean warship in a disputed area, led Canada to impose tight restrictions on the relationship.\n\nOttawa announced the adoption of a Controlled Engagement Policy toward North Korea, which remains in place today.\n\nAccording to Global Affairs Canada, under this policy, Ottawa's official contacts with Pyongyang are limited to subjects concerning only regional security concerns, the human rights and humanitarian situation in North Korea, inter-Korean relations, and consular issues.\n\n\"All government-to-government cooperation and communication on topics not covered under the Controlled Engagement Policy has been suspended,\" Global Affairs says on its website.\n\nIn addition, in August 2011, Canada imposed economic sanctions against North Korea under the Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA). Under the SEMA sanctions, Canadian individuals and companies are banned from trading with North Korea and making new investments there, as well as providing financial services to North Korea and North Korean nationals.\n\nThe provision of humanitarian goods is exempted from the SEMA sanctions that were in addition to sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council and implemented in Canadian law.", "time": "16:27:00"}

It is not known exactly when Mr. Lim, who is in his early 60s, will land back in Canada.\n\nHe was freed this week on \"sick bail\" from a North Korean labour camp after a Canadian delegation, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's national security adviser Daniel Jean, visited the isolated country to discuss the pastor's case.\n\nThe decision comes as Washington and Pyongang trade increasing threats about the possibility of nuclear action, with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday warning that his previous remarks about North Korea being \"met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\" may not have been \"tough enough.\" Meanwhile, North Korea vowed to ignite an \"enveloping fire\" of test missiles, designed to land 30 to 40 kilometres offshore of the U.S. territory of Guam.\n\nNorth Korea's handling of American prisoner Otto Warmbier, who was released on June 13 but died six days later, had sparked intense criticism in the United States and may have fuelled the political appetite for confronting North Korea over its long-range nuclear missile program.\n\nUnder those circumstances, there was thinking that Pyongyang might be eager to release a prisoner in grave health. But Mr. Lim, who is said to have high blood pressure and endured weight loss while in custody, appeared to be in good health, based on the news footage of him in Japan on Thursday.\n\nBut the international political tensions over North Korea's nuclear program might have made the regime more willing to release Mr. Lim now, some North Korea observers believe. Under so much pressure from the United States, it might want to appear to be acting reasonably with other countries.\n\n\"I think it is possible that North Korea wanted to make some kind of de-icing gesture with Western countries,\" said Peter Lee, the chief executive of the U.S. branch of the North Korea Strategy Centre.\n\nIt's also not the first time that North Korea has released a prisoner for non-health reasons - usually after a series of secret negotiations and on condition that a high-level delegation is dispatched. James Clapper, the former U.S. director of national intelligence, went to Pyongyang to secure the release of two prisoners: Matthew Miller and Kenneth Bae. Former U.S. presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, both out of office, also conducted such missions. Such delegations help the regime keep face, Mr. Lee said.\n\nTypically, such envoys carry a letter from the national leader - Mr. Clapper, for example, carried a letter from then-president Barack Obama that described the release of two prisoners as a \"positive gesture.\"\n\nBrock University professor Charles Burton, who writes about China and North Korea, said it would be typical for Mr. Trudeau to send such a letter with his envoy. \"I think that would have been critical to the success of the whole operation.\"\n\nMr. Trudeau's office would not confirm whether the Prime Minister sent a letter or offered any concession in exchange for Mr. Lim's release.\n\nMr. Lim, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada and travelled to North Korea regularly on humanitarian missions, was sentenced by the country's Supreme Court in December, 2015, to a lifetime of hard labour after being accused of attempting to overthrow the regime.\n\nPaul Evans, a professor at the University of British Columbia's Institute of Asian Research, also cited the Warmbier case as a potential factor in Mr. Lim's release.\n\nBut he also said Pyongang could be attempting to re-engage with Canada, and sees an opportunity with the Trudeau government after harsh treatment by the previous Conservative government.\n\n\"My sense is that the North Koreans consistently have wanted representation and interaction with Canadian government officials. It is us who have closed the door to the North Koreans,\" Prof. Evans said.\n\nHe also said the country could be fascinated by Mr. Trudeau's ability to manage his relationship with Mr. Trump, and is attempting to expand its diplomatic scope with Washington.\n\n\"Some well-informed people are saying that in the midst of bombast from North Korea, that there are signs of a desire for discussions with the outside,\" Prof. Evans said, adding that it's \"really hard to tell.\"\n\n\"If they did want to do that, having Daniel Jean come could have been very useful to them. They would have seen it as exponentially valuable to them.\"\n\nLisa Pak, a spokeswoman for the Lim family who grew up with the pastor's son, James, said she believes Canada sent a strong diplomatic message to North Korea by sending Mr. Jean as the Prime Minister's special envoy.\n\n\"I really applaud Canada's approach this time,\" she said. \"It was such a foil against all the other negative rhetoric that's been going back and forth.\"\n\nMs. Pak said Mr. Lim's family is \"relieved, grateful, excited, anxious to see him home,\" where he will meet his granddaughter for the first time. The family also thanked Mr. Trudeau, Canadian officials and the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang, which helps Canada with diplomatic matters in a country where Canada does not have a diplomatic presence.\n\n\"There is a long way to go in terms of Reverend Lim's healing, therefore, in the meantime we ask the media for privacy as he reconnects with his loved ones and receives medical attention,\" the family said in a statement. \"Finally, we want to thank the global community for the continued prayers and support and we also ask that the world does not forget the people of North Korea.\"\n\nMr. Trudeau on Thursday officially confirmed Mr. Lim's release, almost a day after North Korean media first reported that the pastor had been freed. It is unclear what transpired during that time and the PMO has said it wouldn't comment on an active case.\n\nJoseph Caron, Canada's ambassador to China between 2001 and 2005, said the fact that the North Koreans released information about Mr. Lim before Canada suggests they were \"doing this, of course, for their own purposes.\"\n\n\"On the Canadian side - it isn't over until it's over. You're dealing with a regime that is totally unpredictable and quite possibly the ... communications decision was, we don't move until everything is in order, and maybe he's even out of the airspace,\" he said.\n\nMr. Trudeau said little about what led to Mr. Lim's release - \"operational security considerations prevent us from discussing the matter further\" - but noted the role of Mr. Jean and Sweden in securing Mr. Lim's release.", "time": "03:03:00"}

He is known to need medication to manage high blood pressure and was reportedly in poor health during his time in North Korea.\n\nLim was sentenced to hard labour for life in December 2015 for what North Korea said was an attempt to overthrow the regime. Ottawa sent a delegation earlier this week to negotiate his release.\n\nHis family thanked Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and other officials, including Sweden's ambassador to North Korea, for their efforts. Canada does not have diplomatic offices in Pyongyang and relies on Sweden to handle consular issues.\n\nLim will meet his granddaughter for the first time when he returns home, according to a statement from his family. His wife and son live in the Toronto area, and he is attached to the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga, Ont., one of the largest churches in Canada.\n\nThe church has said he visited North Korea more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home.

since Warmbier's death with the exception for journalists and humanitarian workers.\n\nLim had complained of stomach pain and high blood pressure in his letters to family, friends and members of his church in Mississauga, Ontario.\n\nLim's family was able to send him letters and blood pressure medication via the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang as they were not allowed to see him during his imprisonment.\n\nSwedish embassy in Pyongyang often serves as an intermediary for prisoners from nations with no formal diplomatic ties to North Korea.\n\nHe was detained in February 2015 while on a

The Trump White House made it clear it believed Warmbier was treated poorly while he was being held.\n\nAfter the United Nations imposed new sanctions against North Korea, news broke that the rogue regime could have the capacity to deliver a nuclear warhead to the United States on a missile, which prompted a war of words between North Korea and the United States.\n\nPresident Trump warned North Korea not to make \"any more threats\" against the United States. \"They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen,\" Trump said Tuesday.\n\nNorth Korean military officials retorted that they are \"carefully examining\" a preemptive strike against Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific with major military installations. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson downplayed the threat during a flight to the island.\n\n\"Americans should sleep well at night,\" Tillerson told reporters. \"I never considered re-routing the trip back, and I do not believe that there is any imminent threat, in my own view.\"\n\nLim, a Korean-Canadian pastor, was arrested on charges of \"\"subversive plots\" against Kim Jong Un's dictatorship in 2015, during one of more than 100 trips to the country, according to South Korean media. He is the second western prisoner released from North Korea in two months.\n\nThe pastor's release, following the arrival of a Canadian envoy, might auger for the direct negotiations between the United States and North Korea that Russia and China have endorsed. But Tillerson maintained that any talks cannot take place until North Korea recognizes the imperative that they will have to surrender their nuclear weapons program.\n\n\"We don't think having a dialogue where the North Koreans come to the table assuming they're going to maintain their nuclear weapons is productive,\" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters last week.", "time": "18:54:00"}

Canadian pastor serving a life sentence in the country after two and a half years in detention.\n\nHyeon Soo Lim, convicted of crimes against the state in December 2015, was \"released on sick bail\" Wednesday by the country's top court for \"humanitarian\" reasons, CNN quoted state-run news agency KCNA as saying.\n\nLim's son, James Lim, was informed over the weekend that a letter to Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un was dispatched in a plane carrying senior Canadian officials and a medical doctor, to Pyongyang at the last minute, said a family spokeswoman, Lisa Pak.\n\nPak said that the pastor's health had worsened while in North Korean custody and he had also experienced dramatic weight loss.\n\nAccording to the reports, Lim's family had stepped up calls for his release since the death of University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier in June.\n\nA travel ban preventing nearly all the U.S. citizens from visiting North Korea was announced by the U.S. State Department that will take effect next month since Warmbier's death with the exception for journalists and humanitarian workers.\n\nLim had complained of stomach pain and high blood pressure in his letters to family, friends and members of his church in Mississauga, Ontario.\n\nLim's family was able to send him letters and blood pressure medication via the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang as they were not allowed to see him during his imprisonment.\n\nSwedish embassy in Pyongyang often serves as an intermediary for prisoners from nations with no formal diplomatic ties to North Korea.\n\nHe was detained in

officials are in North Korea trying to secure the release of a pastor, imprisoned in the pariah state since 2015.\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed on Tuesday his national security and intelligence adviser Daniel Jean is in Pyongyang leading a team to discuss the case of Toronto Presbyterian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported.\n\nDetained in early 2015, Lim was sentenced to a life of hard labour on December 16, 2015 for 'harming the dignity of the supreme leader,' 'trying to use religion to destroy North Korea' and 'assisting North Koreans escape.'\n\nNow in his 60s, Lim's health is worsening according to a Canadian delegation who visited him last year and letters to his friends say he is suffering from high blood pressure and stomach pains.\n\nConfirming the presence of the diplomatic negotiation, Trudeau's spokesman Cameron Ahmad, said: 'Obviously, Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case.'\n\nIt comes at a high of heightened tensions between North Korea and the West after US President Donald Trump reacted with fury to an intelligence report that suggested Pyongyang had the nuclear firepower to hit America.\n\nTrump warned North Korea's supreme leader Kim Jong-un any threats would be met 'with fire and fury and, frankly, power the likes of which the world has never seen before'.\n\nNorth Korea responded by saying on state media it is considering a strike on the US Pacific territory of Guam.\n\nPyongyang has been carrying out several missile tests in recent weeks and has tested nuclear devices five times, including two intercontinental ballistic middles (ICBM) in July, in what are perceived to be acts of aggression towards the West.\n\nIn response the UN approved further economic sanctions on North Korea on Saturday in an attempt to pressurise Kim Jong-un to give up his nuclear weapons.\n\nA senior Canadian official said their trip was solely linked to Lim's condition and was not related to the increasing global tensions with the state.", "time": "06:30:00"}

Light Korean Presbyterian church in Mississauga, Ontario - was 'ecstatic' at the news of his release.\n\nCanada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau welcomed the news and said, 'The Government of Canada was actively engaged on Mr Lim's case at all levels.'\n\nHis statement continued, 'Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the Government of Canada, and we are working to ensure that he receives any required medical attention.' That was all he could reveal at the moment,' Operational security considerations prevent us from discussing the matter further,' the prime minister said.\n\nThe seriousness of Pastor Lim's situation became even more clear after the death of US student Otto Warmbier earlier this year, after his release from North Korean imprisonment. Pastor Lim is reported to be in poor health.\n\nPresident Trump has dialled up the rhetoric against North Korea in recent days, saying he would respond to North Korean aggression with, 'fire and fury and, frankly, power the likes of which the world has never seen before'.\n\nPastor Lim's church, which is around 3,000 strong, has supported various missions to North Korea. He is of South Korean origin. He has made over 100 trips to the North since 1997 and helps to run nursing home and orphanages there.\n\nBut in February 2015, he was arrested and eventually found guilty of trying to overthrow the regime of Kim Jong Un. He has been in captivity ever since, in spite of poor health.\n\nRaymond Cho, a member of parliament who knows Pastor Lim said he was relieved at his release. 'I believe in the power of prayer, he said, 'I prayed for him every night, twice a night.'\n\nAnother politician who had campaigned for his release, Senator Yonah Martin said, 'I had a great sense of relief but it took me by surprise only because it had been so long.'", "time": "06:45:00"}

Mr. Trudeau also cited the role of Sweden, which has an embassy in Pyongyang, in helping to secure Mr. Lim's release.\n\n\"I am pleased and relieved to confirm that Pastor Lim has been released from jail in North Korea and that he will soon be reunited with his family and friends in Canada,\" Mr. Trudeau said in an early morning statement.\n\nMr. Trudeau said little about what led to Mr. Lim's release - \"operational security considerations prevent us from discussing the matter further\" - but noted the role of Mr. Jean and Sweden, which aids Canada on diplomatic matters in the rogue nation. The Canadian representatives arrived in Pyongyang in a government plane, according to a source with knowledge of the situation who spoke on condition of anonymity because of its sensitivity.\n\n\"The government of Canada was actively engaged on Mr. Lim's case at all levels,\" Mr. Trudeau said.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada, and we are working to ensure that he receives any required medical attention.\"\n\nMr. Lim's release comes at a time when Pyongyang is at the centre of high-pitched international tension over its nuclear-missile program that has dominated attention from Washington to Beijing. On Thursday, North Korea said it was completing plans to fire four intermediate-range missiles over Japan to land near the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam, in an unusually detailed threat that further heightened tensions with the United States.\n\nMr. Lim's family is \"relieved, grateful, excited, anxious to see him home,\" Ms. Pak said in a statement Thursday, which also thanked Canadian and Swedish officials.\n\n\"We are relieved to hear that Reverend Lim is on his way home to finally reunite with his family and meet his granddaughter for the first time,\" the statement said.\n\n\"There is a long way to go in terms of Reverend Lim's healing, therefore, in the meantime we ask the media for privacy as he reconnects with his loved ones and receives medical attention. Finally, we want to thank the global community for the continued prayers and support and we also ask that the world does not forget the people of North Korea.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether the international tensions swirling around North Korea had any effect on the case of Mr. Lim, about whom family and friends were growing increasingly worried. But many experts have drawn comparisons to the case of Otto Warmbier, an American university student who fell into a coma while imprisoned in North Korea. Mr. Warmbier was released June 13, but died six days later in the United States.\n\nIt's possible that Mr. Lim's release might be North Korea's way of sending a goodwill message at a time of high tension, to try to portray itself as a reasonable country that can negotiate, said Steven Denney, a doctoral fellow at the Munk School of Global Affairs' Asian Institute.\n\n\"I think that North Korea understood that it was on thinner ice than usual,\" he said, adding that it's possible the regime is being more cautious with Mr. Lim's health problems.", "time": "18:50:00"}

Yokota airbase and the Canadian embassy in Tokyo declined to confirm the flight had been arranged when contacted by the Guardian.\n\nAccording to media reports, Otto Warmbier, the American college student who died in June, days after being released by North Korea, was flown from Pyongyang to another US military base in Japan, on the country's northernmost island of Hokkaido.\n\nNorth Korea's official KCNA news agency reported that a Canadian delegation had left the country on Thursday, according to NK News. In addition, a Twitter account monitoring civilian and military flight showed data indicating that a Royal Canadian air force plane had taken off from Yokota on Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, confirmed that Lim had been released and would \"soon be reunited with his family and friends in Canada\".\n\nA Canadian delegation, led by the country's national security adviser, Daniel Jean, took up Lim's case after arriving in North Korea earlier in the week. Sweden's embassy in Pyongyang, which represents several western nations in North Korea, also helped finalise his release.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and wellbeing remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada, and we are working to ensure that he receives any required medical attention,\" Trudeau said in a statement.\n\n\"Operational security considerations prevent us from discussing the matter further.\"\n\nLim, 61, had been sentenced to hard labour for life in December 2015 after North Korea accused him of attempting to overthrow the regime. He was freed on \"sick bail from the humanitarian viewpoint\", according to KCNA.\n\nHe is expected to return to Canada later on Thursday and will be taken to hospital on arrival at his wife's request, a source told Reuters.\n\nLim told CNN last year he spent his days in prison digging holes. \"I wasn't originally a labourer so the labour was hard at first,\" he said.\n\nPyongyang views foreign missionaries with deep suspicion, though it allows some to undertake humanitarian work. A number of Christian missionaries - mostly ethnic Koreans who are US citizens - have been arrested in the past, with some only allowed to return home after intervention by high-profile US political figures.\n\nConcern about North Korea's treatment of foreign detainees has grown since Warmbier's death, days after he was medically evacuated to the US suffering from serious brain damage.\n\nWarmbier had served 17 months of a 15-year sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel. North Korea is still holding three Americans.\n\nWarmbier's death prompted the US state department to ban US tourists from visiting North Korea from September.", "time": "10:38:00"}

pastor released this week after more than two years in a North Korean prison say he is \u00e2\u0080\u009con his way home\u00e2\u0080\u009d and they are anxious to be reunited with him.\n\nThe Korean Central News Agency reported Wednesday that North Korea\u00e2\u0080\u0099s central court had decided to free Hyeong Soo Lim, who was serving a life sentence for anti-state activities.\n\nThe pastor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s release was described as \u00e2\u0080\u009csick bail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d but no other details were given.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, a spokeswoman for his family said \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere is a long way to go\u00e2\u0080\u009d in terms of Lim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s healing and stressed the need for privacy as he receives unspecified medical attention.\n\nLisa Pak also said the family is grateful to the Canadian government and the Swedish embassy in North Korea for working behind the scenes to secure the pastor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s freedom. She did not say when he was scheduled to arrive in Canada.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday he was \u00e2\u0080\u009cpleased and relieved\u00e2\u0080\u009d that Lim had been released.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cPastor Lim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the government of Canada, and we are working to ensure that he receives any required medical attention,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Trudeau said in a brief statement.\n\nThe prime minister also thanked Sweden for its assistance in the matter but said \u00e2\u0080\u009coperational security considerations\u00e2\u0080\u009d prevent the government from discussing the matter further.\n\nA Canadian delegation led by Daniel Jean, Trudeau\u00e2\u0080\u0099s national security adviser, was in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang this week to discuss Lim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s case.\n\nLim, a pastor with the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga, Ont., had been sentenced by a North Korean court to life in prison with hard labour for what it called crimes against the state.\n\nCharges against him included harming the dignity of the supreme leadership, trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system, disseminating negative propaganda about the North to overseas Koreans, and helping American and South Korean efforts to help people defect from the north.\n\nLim, who has a wife and son living in the Toronto area, started the Light Korean Presbyterian Church nearly three decades ago, shortly after he emigrated from South Korea.\n\nHe grew the congregation from about a dozen people in 1986 to more than 3,000 members. He also runs a smaller church in downtown Toronto that caters to young people.\n\nThe church has taken on numerous humanitarian projects in North Korea, one of which prompted Lim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last trip there in January 2015.\n\nMembers of the congregation celebrated news of his release Wednesday.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\" With files from The Associated Press", "time": "15:39:00"}

Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.\n\nHyeon-soo Lim, the Korean Canadian church leader sentenced to life in prison with hard labor, has been freed today, Aug. 9, \"on sick bail,\" says a North Korean state news agency. Convicted in Dec. 2015 by the country's Supreme Court of numerous charges, including an attempt to overthrow the government, he had been detained in North Korea since February 2015.\n\nHis release comes weeks after 22-year-old American student Otto Warmbier died at home, a week after he had been belatedly freed after his 15-month detention for stealing a small flag from his Pyongyang hotel.\n\nThis still leaves three Korean-Americans detained in North Korea, two of whom taught at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology -- Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song. Tony Kim, like Hyeun-Soo Lim, was involved with work in orphanages, and it was for this he was apparently detained, not his teaching at the university.\n\nThe third, Kim Dong Chul, a South Korea-born businessman and naturalized U.S. citizen, is serving a sentence of 10 years of hard labor for \"espionage\".\n\nMeanwhile, a North Korean man, Kim Seung-mo, 61, was arrested in early June on \"spying\" charges after meeting Christian relatives in China.\n\nHyeun-Soo Lim, head pastor at the Light Presbyterian Church in Toronto, had visited North Korea more than 100 times to distribute humanitarian aid for nursing homes, daycare centers and orphanages.\n\nLim's family had been disappointed in 2015 when Canada's newly elected government failed in attempts to secure his release.\n\nBut his release now comes one day after a special envoy of the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, had arrived in Pyongyang.\n\nLim's church lost contact with him in Jan. 2015; it was thought that he had been quarantined as part of the government's attempt to prevent the spread of Ebola. In Feb. 2015, it was revealed that Lim had been arrested and charged with slandering the North Korean leadership and its system of government. He was accused of trying to overthrow the country and establish a religious state.\n\nDuring a press conference in July 2015, Lim was forced to read out a public confession. Usually North Korea pronounces a sentence within weeks after such a \"confession,\" but this time it took five months.\n\n\"Most likely, diplomatic efforts to secure Lim's release failed,\" World Watch Monitor was told in December 2015. The source, who cannot be named for security reasons, said North Korea had probably hoped to get more out of the negotiations. \"Whatever that 'more' is, we don't know. Pastors like Lim, who have seen so much of how North Korea treats its prisoners, cannot easily be released. Unless Canada makes an offer North Korea can't refuse, I don't see Lim returning home anytime soon,\" the source said at the time.\n\nLim was involved in humanitarian aid and not with the \"underground\" church. It is believed his arrest and sentence would have had no impact on this church network, \"but a case like this does outrage the North Korean government\", the source said. \"North Korean Christians could be dealt with even more harshly if they are exposed.\"\n\nSince Lim's arrest, North Korea has applied a stricter visa policy. Last month, after Warmbier's death, the U.S. ordered that no U.S. citizen is to be allowed to visit North Korea.\n\nIn May 2014, North Korea sentenced South Korean pastor Kim Jong-Wook to a life of hard labor. As a missionary, Kim operated from the Chinese border city, Dandong, where he provided shelter, food and other aid to North Korean refugees who crossed the border seeking relief from the famine in their country. Kim also taught the refugees about the Bible.\n\nNorth Korean agents infiltrated his network and convinced him to visit their country, which he did on Oct. 8, 2013. Kim was expecting to find out what had happened to some refugees with whom he had lost contact, but instead he was arrested, interrogated and possibly tortured.\n\nIn Feb. 2014, Kim told assembled North Korean television cameras he had spied for the South Korean government, had given money to North Koreans to set up 500 \"underground\" churches and attempted to overthrow the regime. After a trial in May 2014, North Korea's state media reported that prosecutors had sought the death penalty for Kim, but the court imposed the life sentence after the pastor had \"sincerely repented\".\n\nTo understand North Korea, it must be remembered that it links Christianity with South Korea and the United States, considered to be enemies of the state. Ever since North Korean Christians fled communist oppression and made a run for the South during the Korean War in the early 1950s, they have been seen as traitors. After the war, tens of thousands of Christians were arrested, forced into hard labor or put to death. A small remnant of the Christians who stayed went underground to live their faith in secret.\n\nThe successful arrests of Kim and other missionaries -- such as Korean-American Kenneth Bae and Australian John Short, both of whom were later released -- are part of the reason why North Korea has been extending its crackdown on Christian activities in its own country and the Chinese border area.\n\nObservers believe that Christians make the North Korean authorities feel insecure by -- allegedly -- spying for the enemy, meeting in secret and not revering their government enough. Comparisons are sometimes made with the Jews and what they represented in Nazi Germany -- the Christians in Kim Jong-Un's regime are seen as disloyal, which is not just a transgression of the law, but also a sin of the gravest kind that deserves severe punishment.\n\n\"I was locked up for years in Camp 25 near Chongjin [a camp for political prisoners where many Christians are thought to be held],\" said one North Korean refugee. \"I will never forget the prisoners who were too weak to continue their work. The guards would pick them up and put them on an automatic belt that threw them into a large oven while they were still alive.\"\n\nDespite all the arrests, the North Korean government has not won its \"war\" against Christianity. The church has survived almost 70 years of severe persecution. According to Open Doors, an expert source on North Korean Christianity, there are about 300,000 Christians in North Korea, which has for the last 11 years topped its World Watch List of the most repressive places to live if you are a Christian.\n\nThis article originally appeared on World Watch Monitor.\n\nReaders are Leaders!

of ethnic Korean missionaries in Canada and the United States called Lim one of the most influential Christian missionaries operating in North Korea.\n\nHe had visited the country dozens of times, working with orphanages and nursing homes.\n\nBut some projects he worked on, including a noodle plant and flour mills, were linked to associates of Jang Song-Thaek, the purged uncle of leader Kim Jong-Un.

whom he had not seen since 2015 when he was sentenced to a life of hard labour, after being accused of trying to overthrow the regime.\n\nFamily members will hold a press conference in Mississauga Saturday afternoon at the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga. Mr. Lim is expected to attend a service at the church on Sunday morning.\n\nMr. Lim, who is in his early 60s, was released from prison on Wednesday, freed on \"sick bail\" after a Canadian delegation led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's national security adviser Daniel Jean visited the country to discuss his case.\n\nMr. Trudeau so far has said only that he is \"pleased and relieved\" about Mr. Lim's release, declining to go into detail, citing operational security considerations.\n\n\"The government of Canada was actively engaged on Mr. Lim's case at all levels,\" he said. \"In particular, I want to thank Sweden, our protecting power in North Korea, for assisting us.\"\n\n\"We are grateful to all parties involved; Prime Minister Trudeau, Minister [Chrystia] Freeland, and all the public servants in Global Affairs who have worked behind the scenes with North Korean authorities to bring Reverend Lim home,\" Ms. Pak said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"We would also like to extend a particular thank you to Ambassador Torkel Stiernl\u00f6f and the staff at the Swedish Embassy for their tireless efforts and critical role in securing his release. There is a long way to go in terms of Reverend Lim's healing.\"\n\nThe pastor, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, had travelled to North Korea regularly on humanitarian missions before his detainment.\n\nThe release comes at a time of swirling international tension in Pyongyang, Steven Denney, a doctoral fellow at the Munk School of Global Affairs' Asian Institute, has said it is possible that Mr. Lim's release was intended as a goodwill message, to try to portray itself as a country capable of reasonable negotiation.\n\n\"I think that North Korea understood that it was on thinner ice than usual,\" he said, referencing the case of Otto Warmbier, an American University student who fell into a coma while imprisoned in North Korea - he was released June 13, but died six days later.\n\nMr. Lim's family had grown increasingly concerned for his wellbeing following the death of Mr. Warmbier. Ms. Pak confirmed that Mr. Lim - who is said to suffer from high blood pressure and is believed to have lost a significant amount of weight since his capture - will be receiving medical attention.\n\nIt's possible the regime is being more cautious with Mr. Lim's health problems, Mr. Denney said.\n\n\"That incident met with major U.S. and international backlash against North Korea. It catalyzed discussions over additional human-rights-focused sanctions and prompted countries to re-evaluate their policies on tourism to the North,\" said Andrea Berger, senior research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump set a confrontational tone Tuesday, when he said the United States would respond to North Korean threats \"with fire and fury the world has never seen.\"\n\nCanada's Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland has pledged Canada's support to the United States, calling North Korea's nuclear missile program \"a grave threat to the world.\"\n\n\"What North Korea is doing is absolutely unacceptable, and is posing an unacceptable security threat both in the region and to the entire world,\" Ms. Freeland said Friday in Edmonton, after a meeting with agriculture groups in the lead-up to next week's North American free-trade talks.\n\n\"We are also very clear that we stand by all of our allies, very much including the United States. When they are threatened, we are there.\"", "time": "16:19:00"}

Charisma News. Listen at charismapodcastnetwork.com.\n\nHyeun-soo Lim, the Korean Canadian church leader sentenced to life in prison with hard labor, has been freed today, 9 August \"on sick bail\", says a North Korean state news agency. Convicted in December 2015 by the country's Supreme Court of numerous charges, including an attempt to overthrow the government, he had been detained in North Korea since February 2015.\n\nHis release comes weeks after 22-year-old American student Otto Warmbier died at home, a week after he had been belatedly freed after his 15-month detention for stealing a small flag from his Pyongyang hotel.\n\nThis still leaves three Korean-Americans detained in North Korea, two of whom taught at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology -- Tony Kim and Kim Hak Song. Tony Kim, like Hyeun-Soo Lim, was involved with work in orphanages, and it was for this he was apparently detained, not his teaching at the university.\n\nThe third, Kim Dong Chul, a South Korea-born businessman and naturalized U.S. citizen, is serving a sentence of 10 years of hard labor for \"espionage\".\n\nMeanwhile, a North Korean man, Kim Seung-mo, 61, was arrested in early June on \"spying\" charges after meeting Christian relatives in China.\n\nHyeun-Soo Lim, head pastor at the Light Presbyterian Church in Toronto, had visited North Korea more than 100 times to distribute humanitarian aid for nursing homes, day-care centres and orphanages.\n\nLim's family had been disappointed in 2015 when Canada's newly elected government failed in attempts to secure his release.\n\nBut his release now comes one day after a special envoy of the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, had arrived in Pyongyang.\n\nLim's church lost contact with him in January 2015; it was thought that he had been quarantined as part of the government's attempt to prevent the spread of Ebola. In February 2015 it was revealed that Lim had been arrested and charged with slandering the North Korean leadership and its system of government. He was accused of trying to overthrow the country and establish a religious state.\n\nDuring a press conference in July 2015, Lim was forced to read out a public confession. Usually North Korea pronounces a sentence within weeks after such a \"confession,\" but this time it took five months.\n\n\"Most likely, diplomatic efforts to secure Lim's release failed,\" World Watch Monitor was told in December 2015. The source, who cannot be named for security reasons, said North Korea had probably hoped to get more out of the negotiations. \"Whatever that 'more' is, we don't know. Pastors like Lim, who have seen so much of how North Korea treats its prisoners, cannot easily be released. Unless Canada makes an offer North Korea can't refuse, I don't see Lim returning home anytime soon,\" the source said at the time.\n\nLim was involved in humanitarian aid and not with the \"underground\" church. It is believed his arrest and sentence would have had no impact on this church network, \"but a case like this does outrage the North Korean government\", the source said. \"North Korean Christians could be dealt with even more harshly if they are exposed.\"\n\nSince Lim's arrest, North Korea has applied a stricter visa policy. Last month, after Warmbier's death, the U.S. ordered that no U.S. citizen is to be allowed to visit North Korea.\n\nIn May 2014, North Korea sentenced South Korean pastor Kim Jong-Wook to a life of hard labor. As a missionary, Kim operated from the Chinese border city, Dandong, where he provided shelter, food and other aid to North Korean refugees who crossed the border seeking relief from the famine in their country. Kim also taught the refugees about the Bible.\n\nNorth Korean agents infiltrated his network and convinced him to visit their country, which he did on 8 October 2013. Kim was expecting to find out what had happened to some refugees with whom he had lost contact, but instead he was arrested, interrogated and possibly tortured.\n\nIn February 2014, Kim told assembled North Korean television cameras he had spied for the South Korean government, had given money to North Koreans to set up 500 \"underground\" churches and attempted to overthrow the regime. After a trial in May 2014, North Korea's state media reported that prosecutors had sought the death penalty for Kim, but the court imposed the life sentence after the pastor had \"sincerely repented\".\n\nTo understand North Korea, it must be remembered that it links Christianity with South Korea and the United States, considered to be enemies of the state. Ever since North Korean Christians fled communist oppression and made a run for the South during the Korean War in the early 1950s, they have been seen as traitors. After the war, tens of thousands of Christians were arrested, forced into hard labour or put to death. A small remnant of the Christians who stayed went underground to live their faith in secret.\n\nThe successful arrests of Kim and other missionaries -- such as Korean-American Kenneth Bae and Australian John Short, both of whom were later released -- are part of the reason why North Korea has been extending its crackdown on Christian activities in its own country and the Chinese border area.\n\nObservers believe that Christians make the North Korean authorities feel insecure by -- allegedly -- spying for the enemy, meeting in secret and not revering their government enough. Comparisons are sometimes made with the Jews and what they represented in Nazi Germany -- the Christians in Kim Jong-Un's regime are seen as disloyal, which is not just a transgression of the law, but also a sin of the gravest kind that deserves severe punishment.\n\n\"I was locked up for years in Camp 25 near Chongjin [a camp for political prisoners where many Christians are thought to be held],\" said one North Korean refugee. \"I will never forget the prisoners who were too weak to continue their work. The guards would pick them up and put them on an automatic belt that threw them into a large oven while they were still alive.\"\n\nDespite all the arrests, the North Korean government has not won its \"war\" against Christianity. The church has survived almost 70 years of severe persecution. According to Open Doors, an expert source on North Korean Christianity, there are about 300,000 Christians in North Korea, which has for the last 11 years topped its World Watch List of the most repressive places to live if you are a Christian.\n\nThis article originally appeared on World Watch Monitor.\n\nReaders are Leaders!

pastor serving a life sentence in the country after two and a half years in detention.\n\nHyeon Soo Lim, convicted of crimes against the state in December 2015, was \"released on sick bail\" Wednesday by the country's top court for \"humanitarian\" reasons, CNN quoted state-run news agency KCNA as saying.\n\nLim's son, James Lim, was informed over the weekend that a letter to Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un was dispatched in a plane carrying senior Canadian officials and a medical doctor, to Pyongyang at the last minute, said a family spokeswoman, Lisa Pak.\n\nPak said that the pastor's health had worsened while in North Korean custody and he had also experienced dramatic weight loss.\n\nAccording to the reports, Lim's family had stepped up calls for his release since the death of University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier in June.\n\nA travel ban preventing nearly all the U.S. citizens from visiting North Korea was announced by the U.S. State Department that will take effect next month since Warmbier's death with the exception for journalists and humanitarian workers.\n\nLim had complained of stomach pain and high blood pressure in his letters to family, friends and members of his church in Mississauga, Ontario.\n\nLim's family was able to send him letters and blood pressure medication via the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang as they were not allowed to see him during his imprisonment.\n\nSwedish embassy in Pyongyang often serves as an intermediary for prisoners from nations with no formal diplomatic ties to North Korea.\n\nHe was detained in February 2015 while on a humanitarian mission in Rajin, North Korea.\n\nLim has made more than 100 trips to North Korea since 1997 for his humanitarian efforts in the country.

Washington D.C. - International Christian Concern (ICC) has learned that Hyeon-Soo Lim, a Korean-Canadian pastor at the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Toronto, Canada who was sentenced to life imprisonment by the North Korean Supreme Court, has been freed after two and a half years in detention.\n\nNews of Lim's release comes soon after a high-level Canadian delegation, led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's own national security advisor, arrived in the country in hopes of intervening in his case.\n\nLim went missing in late January 2015 while taking part in a humanitarian mission in Rajin, North Korea. His efforts included founding a nursing home, an orphanage, and a nursery with support from his church. In July of the same year, Lim resurfaced when he publicly confessed to crimes against the state and started serving a life sentence in December 2015.\n\nAccording to the North Korea's state news agency, KCNA, \"He had been under the penalty of indefinite hard labor as he conducted hostile deeds against the DPRK.\" Lim was released \"on sick bail according to the decision of the Central Court of the DPRK on August 9, 2017 from the humanitarian viewpoint.\"\n\nDuring his time in captivity, pastor Lim complained of stomach pain and high blood pressure in letters to his loved ones in Canada. While his family was banned from visiting during his imprisonment, they were able to send blood pressure medication via the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang.\n\n\"We are relieved to hear that Reverend Lim is on his way home to finally reunite with his family and meet his granddaughter for the first time,\" family spokeswoman, Lisa Pak, said in statement to CNN.\n\n\"This is a truly joyous occasion,\" Suzanne Scholte, chair of North Korea Freedom Coalition, told ICC. \"Lim was imprisoned simply because he served the one true God and wanted Him to be known to the North Korean people. While Pastor Lim's treatment is a reminder of the atrocious and evil nature of the DPRK regime, it should also be a reminder of how vigilant that regime works to keep their population literally and spiritually 'in the dark' as the Christian faith is seen as a direct attack on Kim Jong Un, whom they are brainwashed to worship as their god.\"\n\nGina Goh, ICC's Regional Manager, said, \"While we at International Christian Concern rejoice at the news of Pastor Lim's release, we continue to call upon the US government and international community to press on North Korea to release the three Americans who still remain imprisoned - Pastor Kim Dong Chul, Kim Sang-duk, and Kim Hak-song. Nobody should be held captive and given a life sentence because of their religious beliefs, especially in a country with a deplorable record on its treatment of detainees and one that is ranked as the worst country in the world in regards to Christian persecution.\"\n\nFor interviews, please contact Olivia Miller at Press@persecution.org", "time": "16:18:00"}

churches in Canada, was released on 'sick bail'.\n\nNorth Korea has released the jailed Canadian pastor on Wednesday (9 August) on \"humanitarian grounds\" after a top Canadian diplomat led a delegation to discuss Hyeon Soo Lim's case in Pyongyang.\n\nThe 62-year-old reverend's release comes amid heightened tensions between the US and North Korea over the Kim Jong-un regime's repeated missile launches and threats to strike the Pacific island of Guam.\n\nHyeon, who served in one of the largest churches in Canada, was released on \"sick bail\" by North Korea's Central Court, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported.\n\nA delegation led by Canada's national security adviser and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's intelligence adviser, Daniel Jean, is reported to have negotiated with North Korean officials to secure the pastor's release. Jean and his team were in Pyongyang on Tuesday (8 August).\n\nThe South Korea-born reverend was detained in the rogue state in December 2015 following his arrest for his alleged involvement in subversive acts against Pyongyang.\n\nHyeon was freed hours after President Donald Trump warned that the US would counter any threat from the North with \"fire and fury\", although it is unclear if the pastor's release had any connection to the ongoing standoff between Washington and Pyongyang.\n\n\"Strategically, North Korea perhaps hopes to engender some goodwill from Canada as tensions rise,\" Reuters cited Charles Burton, a former Canadian diplomat in China, as saying. \"They hope that Canada presents some moderating influence on the Trump administration.\n\n\"[But] I do not think it is directly connected to the tensions the US president has ratcheted up. North Korea is concerned he would die in prison.\"\n\nHyeon is expected to return to Canada on Thursday (10 August). But his wife has requested that the reverend should be taken to hospital on arrival, Reuters reported a source who is familiar with the issue as saying.\n\n\"So far, it has been confirmed that government officials and a doctor are accompanying Reverend Lim,\" the source who did not want to be named reportedly told the news agency.\n\nHyeon was charged for allegedly harming the dignity of the North Korean leadership, among others. North Korea also accused Hyeon of trying to overthrow the Kim Jong-un regime using religion. He was eventually sentenced to hard labour for life.\n\nWhile serving the prison term, the pastor was reported to be in poor health, suffering from high blood pressure and had earlier complained of stomach pain.\n\nCanadian Senator Yonah Martin, who advocated for Hyeon's release, said the reverend was hospitalised during his imprisonment.\n\n\"They were sending medication but there was a question as to whether he was actually receiving it in the way he should,\" he said.\n\nHyeon's family became very concerned about his well-being as fears loomed that he might suffer the same fate as American student Otto Warmbier, who - like Hyeon - had been detained for his alleged involvement in subversive acts.\n\nThe 22-year-old died within a few days after he was released by North Korea in June on \"humanitarian grounds\", the same reason for which Hyeon has now been freed.\n\nThe church, where Hyeon was serving before he was detained, is reported to be celebrating the pastor's release.\n\n\"We can't wait to see him,\" said Charles Baik, an associate pastor at the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Ontario. \"I'll bring my guitar and we'll be ready to praise and have worship, and I'm sure that's the first thing he wants to do when he comes back.\"", "time": "07:01:00"}

the energy and is able to head over, to be at the news conference.\n\n\"His family will be there as well,\" said a church member. \"We are so happy he's back and looking forward to seeing him again.\"\n\nFor a long time there, it looked like this day may never happen. During a humanitarian trip to North Korea in 2015, Lim was arrested and eventually sentenced to a life of hard labour for what the regime said was an attempt to overthrow them.\n\nBut the Christian pastor had a 30-year history of feeding people and doing Christian ministry to help people there and in other countries in need.\n\nAt this news conference, he and his family are expected take the opportunity to thank the congregation and the country for their prayers - specifically Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for his work in securing his release.\n\nWith a Canadian delegation, he left Pyongyang on Thursday and was taken to Japan, where he was assessed by doctors and said to be in reasonable health.\n\nHe was released by the North Korean's on what they called \"sick bail.\"\n\nThere was much concern of the pastor's condition in light of what happened in American Otto Warmbier, who died just five days after his release in which he was in a coma.\n\nBut Lim's spirits appear to be good and he's hoping to spend the weeks and months ahead recovering.\n\nWhen he lands today and heads to the church he built, not only will he see a \"Welcome home, Rev. Lim\" sign, but also he'll see his parking lot, complete with his name, is vacant, open and ready for his return.", "time": "14:55:00"}

announced that a Canadian missionary who had been imprisoned since 2015 was released on humanitarian grounds.\n\nLim Hyeon-soo had been sentenced to a life term of forced labour for committing hostile acts against the state.\n\nHe was released on medical and humanitarian grounds, according to the Central Court of North Korea, the state-owned KCNA news agency reported.\n\nThe Canadian citizen of Korean origin had travelled to North Korea through China in January 2015 and was detained by North Korean authorities the same month.\n\nIn a trial held around the end of 2015 in Pyongyang, the country's highest court found Lim guilty of having conspired to overthrow the regime as a part of an alleged conspiracy by the governments of the US and South Korea.\n\nThe missionary was also found guilty of having carried out subversive activities with the intention of damaging the dignity of the supreme leadership and the social system of North Korea.\n\nLim, a sexagenarian head of the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga (near Toronto), had admitted to the accusations in a confession released in July 2015 by KCNA.\n\nHowever, several organisations denounced it as a likely case of a confession forced by authorities.\n\nThe Canadian's release comes at a moment of elevated tensions in the Korean peninsula, as Kim Jong-un's regime and US President Donald Trump's administration have strengthened their rhetoric against each other.\n\nLim's release came just months after the death of US citizen Otto Warmbier, who had been incarcerated in North Korea for 17 months and was sent back to his country in a comatose state.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Business Standard staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "time": "23:35:00"}

missionary who had been imprisoned since 2015 was released on humanitarian grounds.\n\nLim Hyeon-soo had been sentenced to a life term of forced labour for committing hostile acts against the state.\n\nHe was released on medical and humanitarian grounds, according to the Central Court of North Korea, the state-owned KCNA news agency reported.\n\nThe Canadian citizen of Korean origin had travelled to North Korea through China in January 2015 and was detained by North Korean authorities the same month.\n\nIn a trial held around the end of 2015 in Pyongyang, the country's highest court found Lim guilty of having conspired to overthrow the regime as a part of an alleged conspiracy by the governments of the US and South Korea.\n\nThe missionary was also found guilty of having carried out subversive activities with the intention of damaging the dignity of the supreme leadership and the social system of North Korea.\n\nLim, a sexagenarian head of the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Mississauga (near Toronto), had admitted to the accusations in a confession released in July 2015 by KCNA.\n\nHowever, several organisations denounced it as a likely case of a confession forced by authorities.\n\nThe Canadian's release comes at a moment of elevated tensions in the Korean peninsula, as Kim Jong-un's regime and US President Donald Trump's administration have strengthened their

The North Koreans set Hyeon Soo Lim free on what they called \"sick bail\"; he is reportedly on his way home on a Canadian government plane.\n\nIn the scheme of things, this is a modest victory but a welcome one, especially at a time when the rhetoric over North Korea's weapons programs has reached frightening heights.\n\nLim is senior pastor at the Light Presbyterian Church in Mississauga and had made more than 100 trips to North Korea in the past 20 years, supporting orphanages and a seniors' home.\n\nBut in 2015 the North Koreans arrested him, charged him with plotting to overthrow the Kim regime, and had him sentenced to life in prison at hard labour. This, for a 62-year-old pastor engaged in charitable work.\n\nIt's not known what persuaded the North Koreans to do the decent thing in this case and allow Lim to return home to Canada. It's possible they wanted him out before his health deteriorated further and they faced an embarrassing repeat of the case of Otto Warmbier, the American who was so badly treated in North Korea that he died days after being freed.\n\nThe federal government, which sent Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's senior adviser on foreign affairs to Pyongyang, was working behind the scenes and deserves credit for Lim's release.

It seems North Korea responds to top leaders.\n\nBut it is also true that Trudeau deserves full marks for sending over this delegation at this time of tension between North Korean Dear Leader Kim Jong Un and American President Donald Trump.\n\nYou have to give credit where it is due -- and it is due here.\n\nThe next step is for the Canadian to step back on Canadian soil -- and that could come at any time.\n\n\"We are ready,\" said Pak. \"A lot of people will be coming to the church and are so anxious to see pastor again.\"\n\nAnd to hear him preach again -- with some great lessons and tales from his frightening experiences in a North Korean prison.", "time": "23:34:00"}

North Korea", "body": "Released by North Korea on \"sick bail\" or still locked up while a Canadian delegation works to free Rev. Hyeon Soo Lim from a life sentence of hard labour?\n\nLike all things in Pyongyang, intrigue, mystery, secrecy and suspense ruled the day.\n\nWhile the closed communist country announced the pastor of Mississauga Light Presbyterian Church was free, Canada's political leaders and the country's media could not confirm his release.\n\n\"A Canadian government delegation is currently in Pyongyang, DPRK, to discuss Pastor Lim's case,\" said Cameron Ahmad, of the Prime Minister's Office. \"Pastor Lim's health and wellbeing remain of utmost importance to the Government of Canada as we continue to engage on this case. As this is an active case, we will not provide further comment at this time.\"\n\nIf only to be a fly on the wall inside the back room to see the diplomatic acrobatics of Kim's negotiated escape from Pyongyang at a time when the world's eyes are on the country's verbal showdown with United States President Donald Trump. In in the middle of that chaos, a group of Canadians, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's own world affairs and security advisor, Daniel Jean, were engaged in meetings with DPRK officials.\n\n\"Could be more here than meets the eye?\" mused retiring Sen. Bob Runciman on his final day in the Senate as he was pulling for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's efforts to end this nightmare. \"Jean is a career foreign affair's bureaucrat. (Could it possibly be) something related to finding a way to ease tensions between U.S. and N.K.?\"\n\nWhy not! If he could do it, Trudeau would be on the front cover of more than Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nBut securing Lim's freedom needs to be nailed down first.\n\nIn light of what happened to American Otto Warmbier, who was released in a coma June 13 and was dead by June 19, Canadians are cautious.\n\nAnd nothing Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un may do to help him with his problem with Trump would be a surprise either.\n\nCould Lim be used as a bargaining chip in the bigger game?\n\nUntil Lim, who is said to be down to less than 80 pounds, is free and safely out of that country -- and back with his wife and son who are waiting in South Korea -- there will be skepticism.\n\nIt's certainly going in a better direction than it has for the past two years when it was difficult to get help from the federal Conservative or Liberal governments and hard to capture public interest or sympathy.\n\nA media push in June by Pastor Jason Noh, family friend and spokesperson Lisa Pak, Sen. Yonah Martin, MPP Raymond Cho and Rev. Charles McVety, of Canada Christian College, to get Trudeau more engaged seemed to work.\n\n\"Remember Pastor Lim went there 100 times over 30 years to feed people, do humanitarian and Christian work and for that got a life sentence,\" said McVety. \"We pray this is over soon.\"\n\nAt the church, near Rexdale Blvd. and Airport Rd. Wednesday, Helen Park and her friends were doing just that -- singing prayers like they have done every day since Lim's capture in 2015.\n\n\"We don't know if he has been released or his condition,\" she said. \"We hope for the best.\"\n\nWith a view to Lim getting on the Canadian government jet that touched down in Pyongyang Tuesday, the congregation was quietly making a \"Welcome home Rev. Lim\" sign.\n\nThey are hopeful their pastor is now on that jet or will be soon.", "time": "01:46:00"}

Canadian-Korean pastor who had been detained for 30 months has sparked further global interest in others imprisoned in the hermit state.\n\nLim Hyeon-soo was released on \"sick bail\" Wednesday with the North Korean Central Court citing \"humanitarian reasons,\" according to the Korean Central News Agency. The 62-year-old South Korean-born Canadian was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2015 on charges of conspiring against the regime.\n\nLim Hyeon-soo, who pastors the Light Korean Presbyterian Church in Toronto, is escorted to his sentencing in Pyongyang on Dec. 16, 2015. Yonhap\n\nLim's release comes at a sensitive time for the Korean Peninsula with the North threatening to create an \"enveloping fire\" in areas surrounding Guam, a key US military outpost in the Pacific Ocean, dismissing President Donald Trump's warning of \"fire and fury like the world has never seen.\"\n\nThe timing has shifted public concerns to six South Korean citizens now held captive in the North in which Pyongyang has been keeping mum about their whereabouts and condition. North Korea has been overall turning a deaf ear to the Moon Jae-in government's offer to resume inter-Korean dialogue.\n\nThe Unification Ministry here has been continuously vowing to step up its efforts to retrieve the prisoners, but doubts are being raised after a prolonged failure to do so.\n\nExperts are expressing skepticism over connecting the release of Lim with other South Korean detainees.\n\n\"North Korea is maintaining an affable diplomatic relationship with Canada and probably wants to keep it that way,\" said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor at Dongguk University in Seoul.\n\n\"Even though they are perceived as reckless in many ways, it seems they took Otto Warmbier's death (in June) into consideration. Unlike Lim, it would be a lot more difficult for South Korean detainees to return home because we are in a different diplomatic relationship (with the North),\" Koh said.\n\n\"We suspect there are six South Koreans currently detained in North Korea,\" a ministry official said Thursday.\n\nAmong the six, one is a Christian missionary while three are North Korean defectors allegedly abducted by the state's agents, according to reports.\n\n\"We have been consistently requesting the North Korean government to release and return our citizens held captive there. We will continue to make a full effort by cooperating with the international community,\" the official said.\n\nThe official added it has no plans at this time to dispatch a special delegation for such purpose.\n\nSouth Korea's Foreign Ministry echoed the Unification Ministry's statement saying that it is glad to hear the news of Lim's release and hopes North Korea will quickly return its South Korean captives back to the arms of their respective families here.\n\nThe US has been voicing its concerns over its citizens imprisoned in the North after US college student Warmbier's death in June.\n\nUS Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs spokesperson Grace Choi told Voice Of America on Thursday that Washington would like to see US detainees in the North back home as soon as possible. North Korea is currently holding three US Korean-Americans by force.\n\nWarmbier was transported back to his homeland in a state of \"unresponsive wakefulness\" after spending 17 months in the North Korean prison for trying to steal a political banner.\n\nNorth Korean authorities claimed Warmbier's coma was a result of botulism and a sleeping pill, which drew global ire since it did not correspond with his US medical records.\n\nHis death triggered the US State Department to impose a travel ban, which aims to block its citizens from visiting North Korea. The bill will take effect next month.\n\nBy Jung Min-kyung (mkjung@heraldcorp.com)", "time": "09:17:00"}

since the death of University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier in June.\" He has complained of stomach pains and high blood pressure in his letters home from prison and was permitted to receive shipments of blood pressure medication sent through the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang.\n\nLim, who is described by the Associated Press as \"a South Korean-born Canadian citizen in his 60s,\" was imprisoned in 2015 on charges of \"trying to use religion to destroy the North Korean system and helping U.S. and South Korean authorities lure and abduct North Korean citizens.\" He was working on a humanitarian mission for the Korean Presbyterian Church of Toronto at the time. The Canadian government has always denied the charges filed against him.\n\nThe UK Guardian describes Lim as \"one of the most influential Christian missionaries operating in North Korea\" before his arrest and suggests he may have been targeted because he became involved in projects linked to the late Jang Song-thaek. Jang was the reform-minded uncle of dictator Kim Jong-un who suddenly fell out of favor and was infamously executed with an anti-aircraft gun in 2013.\n\nIn an interview with CNN last year, Lim confirmed that he was indeed shipped off to a labor camp to serve out his life sentence with eight hours a day of digging holes to plant apple trees. He was evidently the only inmate at the prison camp in question.\n\n\"Would you say your biggest crime was speaking badly about the supreme leaders of this country?\" CNN asked him, which seems like a very oddly-worded question for a completely independent Western media outlet to ask a prisoner of the Kim regime. Lim's response was, \"Yes, I think so.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Lim family thanked the global community for its prayers and support. \"We also ask that the world does not forget the people of North Korea,\" she added.", "time": "00:03:00"}

His release came a day after Canadian officials said a delegation led by the country's national security adviser had traveled to North Korea to discuss his jailing, Canada's Global News website reported.\n\n\"Rim Hyon Su, a Canadian civilian, was released on sick bail according to the decision of the Central Court of the DPRK on August 9, 2017, from the humanitarian viewpoint,\" the North's official Korean Central News Agency reported, referring to the country by its official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\n\nNo further information was provided.\n\nAutoplay\n\nShow Thumbnails\n\nShow Captions\n\nLast SlideNext Slide\n\nSouth Korea-born Lim's church, in the Toronto area, said he visited the North -- where he helped to establish a nursing home and an orphanage -- more than 100 times since 1997.\n\nHis release came as relations between Pyongyang and Washington deteriorated further after President Trump vowed to respond to North Korea \"with fire and fury\" following the latter's threat to launch a missile strike on the Pacific island of Guam, a U.S. territory.\n\nThree Americans are currently detained in North Korea, as well as six South Korean nationals.\n\nThe American men -- Kim Hak-Song, also known as Jin Xue Song; Tony Kim, also known as Kim Sang-Duk; and Kim Dong-Chul -- were described as being in good health after a recent visit by Joseph Yun, the State Department's top official on North Korea, the Washington Post reported in June.\n\nThat month Otto Warmbier, an American college student who was convicted of stealing a political banner from a Pyongyang hotel in 2016 and sentenced to 15 years with hard labor, was released from imprisonment and returned to the U.S. in a coma. He died in a Cincinnati hospital six days later.\n\nHis family and others blamed North Korea for his condition, but the North denied it cruelly treated or tortured Warmbier. The North had said that shortly after his conviction, Warmbier contracted botulism, a bacteria commonly associated with food poisoning, and was given a sleeping pill.\n\nLim's family had become more concerned for his welfare since Warmbier's death, Reuters reported. Last week, the U.S. State Department said it would ban U.S. nationals from traveling to North Korea from September.\n\nMore: 'Not helpful,' Donald: World reaction to Trump's 'fire and fury' comments\n\nMore: North Korea denies torturing Otto Warmbier\n\nMore: Here are the 3 Americans facing uncertain futures in North Korean jails\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2wHJrh4", "time": "11:36:00"}

Rim Hyon Su, also known as Hyeon Soo Lim, was accused by the state of using religion as a ruse to overthrow the government. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2015.\n\nLim, who is in his 60s, had written to his family members about stomach pains and high blood pressure, according to CNN. In an interview with the network in 2016, he said he prayed daily and was the sole prisoner in his camp, where he was forced to dig holes eight hours a day, six days a week. He asked for a Bible but did not receive one.\n\nThe South Korean-born pastor of Toronto's Light Korean Presbyterian Church had pleaded guilty to trying to undermine the worship of Kim, which is required of all North Koreans.\n\nThe state is officially atheist, with a constitution that guarantees freedom of religious belief. In practice, it has one of the bleakest human rights records in the world and harshly persecutes the religious, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nLim's family said he had traveled to North Korea more than 100 times since 1997, where his church ran missions to support an orphanage and to distribute food.\n\nThe pastor's release came a day after Canadian officials confirmed that a delegation had traveled to North Korea to discuss his imprisonment. Concern over his fate increased after North Korea released an American student in a coma in June.\n\nOtto Warmbier, 22, who had suffered brain damage, died six days later.\n\nIn response, the U.S. State Department announced a ban on Americans' travel to North Korea. That ban, which goes into effect on Sept. 1, allows those who want to participate in humanitarian missions to North Korea to apply for a special passport to do so.\n\nPresident Trump and North Korean officials this week are exchanging bellicose words over the regime's nuclear missile program. Last month North Korea announced the successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach California.\n\nAt least three Americans remain in North Korean custody: businessman Kim Dong-chul, academic Kim Sang-duk and self-described Christian missionary Kim Hak-song.\n\nHak-song, who was taken into custody in May, taught at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. The university, founded in 2010 with donations from South Korean and American Christians, including the Illinois-based Church of the Brethren, remains the only private university in the country.\n\nThe American nonprofit Open Doors, which advocates for persecuted Christians worldwide, lists North Korea as the most oppressive nation for Christians in the world. It estimates that there are 300,000 Christians in the nation of 25 million.", "time": "20:46:00"}

He was serving a life sentence in the country for anti-state activities. As CGTN adds, Rim Hyon Su, also known as Rev. Lim Hyeon-soo was sentenced to life in prison with hard labor in December 2015.\n\nThe release was expected following yesterday's news that Canadian special envoy, Daniel Jean, national security advisor to the prime minister of Canada, and his party had arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday.\n\nAs the WSJ adds, and as we said yesterday, the release of Rev. Lim Hyeon-soo could also lower tensions between North Korea and the Western world. However, hours before Lim was released, North Korea and Donald Trump exchanged heated public threats, which unleashed a \"risk off\" shockwave around the globe.\n\nLim's Toronto-area church has said he visited the North more than 100 times since 1997 and helped set up an orphanage and nursing home. Last year, Lim told CNN he spent eight hours a day digging holes at a labor camp where he had not seen any other prisoners. Lim, 62, was arrested by North Korea in 2015 and given a lifetime sentence of hard labor in December that year for conducting \"hostile deeds\" against the state. Lim's detention of more than two years surpassed that of Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American missionary whose imprisonment in North Korea was the longest known for a U.S. citizen. Mr. Bae was released in late 2014, roughly two years after his detention.\n\nNorth Korea said in a brief statement through its official state media that Mr. Lim was released \"on sick bail,\" citing a humanitarian concern for his health.\n\nThe release comes about two months after Pyongyang released Otto Warmbier, a former University of Virginia undergraduate, to the U.S. following a lengthy detention and sentencing of hard labor. Mr. Warmbier returned to the U.S. with a severe brain injury and died six days after his return.\n\nNorth Korea is still holding three Americans. The U.S. State Department said last week it would ban U.S. nationals from traveling to the isolated country, beginning in September.\n\nSeparately, in a parallel attempt at de-escalataion, Sec. State Rex Tillerson also stepped in to calm the mood, when speaking to reporters this morning, he says he doesn't believe there is \"*any imminent threat*\" from North Korea, and says that they should \"*have no concerns about this particular rhetoric of the last few days.\" *As the AP adds, he downplayed speculation that the US was moving closer to a military option.\n\nIn an amusing twist, Tillerson tried to justify Trump's bombastic threats, saying that \"*Trump is sending a message to North Korea in language Kim Jong Un would understand*.\"\n\nAlso attempting to push the world back from the edge of nuclear armageddon was China, which urged calm on Wednesday after North Korea said it was considering plans for a missile strike on the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam. China called on all parties to *\"avoid any words or actions that might escalate the situation and make even greater efforts to resolve the issue via talks*,\" the ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Germany echoed China's sentiment, when the German government said \"escalating rhetoric\" on North Korea is of \"great concern\" and added that \"continued saber-rattling will certainly be of no help to us,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer told reporters in Berlin. The spokesman added that \"a military course of action cannot be a solution toward a nuclear-free region\" and called on \"all those involved to moderate\" their tone.\n\nAnd while everyone else was seeking to tone down the militant rhetoric, US Senator Senator Graham, with all the grace of a warhawk in a China - or rather North Korea - store was quoted with some rather defiant comments, suggesting the US would go to war with North Korea if Guam were attacked.:\n\n\u00b7 *GRAHAM: U.S. WOULD GO TO WAR WITH N KOREA IF GUAM WERE ATTACKED*\n\n\u00b7 GRAHAM SAYS TRUMP'S N KOREA THREAT A MESSAGE TO CHINA, TOO\n\n\u00b7 GRAHAM: JUST A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL N. KOREA HAS NUCLEAR ICBM\n\n\u00b7 GRAHAM: GOAL IS TO STOP N KOREA FROM DEVELOPING NUCLEAR ICBM\n\nSo will the Neocons and military-industrial complex win this round and launch another meaningless war? The answer may be revealed in Trump's very next tweet.", "time": "21:46:00"}

1:12 a.m. Thursday in a statement confirming what had been reported Wednesday by North Korean state media.\n\nCiting what Trudeau called \"operational security,\" turns out even Mississauga Light Presbyterian Church leaders, Lim's family and their spokesmen were not made aware.\n\nBut they were thrilled with the prime minister's statement.\n\n\"I am pleased and relieved to confirm that Pastor Lim has been released from jail in North Korea and that he will soon be reunited with his family and friends in Canada,\" Trudeau said.\n\nTrudeau thanked Sweden for their assistance with Lim, 62, who had been incarcerated in North Korea for two and a half years.\n\n\"The Government of Canada was actively engaged on Mr. Lim's case at all levels,\" said Trudeau.\n\nThe turning point for Lim happened right in the middle of tense sabre rattling by leadership in North Korea and United States President Donald Trump.\n\nThe key was Trudeau getting involved in this case after pleas for him to do so by family, journalists and opposition politicians in June.\n\n\"This week, a Canadian government delegation led by Daniel Jean, my special envoy, travelled to Pyongyang, North Korea, to discuss Pastor Lim's case,\" he said.\n\nConservative Senator Bob Runciman told me Wednesday that Jean was the right person for this task because of his skill and experience.\n\nIt was a well done operation in what is a very tricky part of the world and an even trickier time.\n\nThe Canadian pastor's life was in jeopardy and the only person who could get him out of there was Trudeau.\n\nAnd he came through.\n\nNow that he's been released, the key now is the pastor's medical situation.\n\nTrudeau said this is a priority. A doctor travelled with the group that went to Pyongyang to tend to concerns that he had dropped down to just 80 pounds and was battling high blood pressure without medication.\n\n\"Pastor Lim's health and well-being remain of utmost importance to the Government of Canada, and we are working to ensure that he receives any required medical attention,\" said Trudeau.\n\nHis family is excited. This has been a long road of worry for them.\n\n\"We are relieved to hear that Reverend Lim is on his way home to finally reunite with his family and meet his granddaughter for the first time,\" the family said in a statement.\n\n\"There is a long way to go in terms of Reverend Lim's healing, therefore, in the meantime we ask the media for privacy as he reconnects with his loved ones and receives medical attention,\" they added, and extended their thoughts to those still in the rogue nation.\n\nWe \"ask that the world does not forget the people of North Korea.\"", "time": "12:28:00"}

PODCAST:\n\nArmed North Korean soldiers patrol the banks of Yalu River near the North Korean town of Sinuiju, opposite the Chinese border city of Dandong, May 20, 2011. Confusion surrounded a North Korean visit to China on Friday, as media in the South said the North's leader Kim Jong-il had crossed the border, contradicting earlier reports that his son and heir apparent Kim Jong-un had travelled. REUTERS/Jacky Chen\n\nRYAN PICKRELLChina/Asia Pacific Repo\n\nNorth Korea has released a Korean-Canadian pastor after detaining him for several years.\n\nHyeon Soo Lim was \"released on sick bail\" Wednesday for \"humanitarian reasons,\" according to North Korean state media. Lim was sentenced to life in prison for crimes against the state two years ago, and since then, the 62-year-old inmate's health has deteriorated.\n\nLim was sentenced to \"indefinite hard labor\" for \"hostile deeds against the DPRK.\"\n\nHe experienced \"dramatic\" weight loss during his incarceration. A plane carrying medical personnel, senior Canadian officials, and a letter to Kim Jong-un were sent to Pyongyang. The Canadian team arrived in North Korea Monday.\n\nLim's release follows the medical release of American prisoner Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student who was sent home in a coma. Warmbier died one week after returning home.\n\nThe North is still holding three U.S. citizens and at least six South Koreans.\n\nThe U.S. recently issued a ban restricting travel to North Korea for U.S. citizens, and that ban is expected to go into effect in early September. The North has said, however, that its doors remain open to any American citizens interested in visiting the country.\n\nTensions between North Korea and the U.S. are on the rise, as North Korea has threatened to take punitive action against the U.S. in response to new sanctions, as well as other perceived provocations. President Donald Trump warnedTuesday that North Korea's threats will be met with \"fire and fury and, frankly, power the likes of which this world has never seen before.\"\n\nFollow Ryan on Twitter\n\nSend tips to ryan@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Rim Hyon Su is freed by the rogue regime -- which never even gave him a Bible\n\nNorth Korea has released a Canadian pastor who was convicted of attempting to undermine the regime of Kim Jong Un.\n\nThe pastor was freed on humanitarian grounds, state media reported Wednesday, August 9.\n\nThe Rev. Rim Hyon Su, also known as Hyeon Soo Lim, was accused by the state of using religion as a ruse to overthrow the government. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2015.\n\nLim, who is in his 60s, had written to his family members about stomach pains and high blood pressure, according to CNN. In an interview with the network in 2016, he said he prayed daily and was the sole prisoner in his camp, where he was forced to dig holes eight hours a day, six days a week. He asked for a Bible but did not receive one.\n\nThe South Korean-born pastor of Toronto's Light Korean Presbyterian Church had pleaded guilty to trying to undermine the worship of Kim, which is required of all North Koreans.\n\nThe state is officially atheist, with a constitution that guarantees freedom of religious belief. In practice, it has one of the bleakest human rights records in the world and harshly persecutes the religious, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nLim's family said he had traveled to North Korea more than 100 times since 1997, where his church ran missions to support an orphanage and a nursery and to distribute food.\n\nThe pastor's release came a day after Canadian officials confirmed that a delegation had traveled to North Korea to discuss his imprisonment. Concern over his fate increased after North Korea released an American student in a coma in June. Otto Warmbier, 22, who had suffered brain damage, died six days later.\n\nIn response, the U.S. State Department announced a ban on Americans' travel to North Korea. That ban, which goes into effect next month, allows those who want to participate in humanitarian missions in North Korea to apply for a waiver.\n\nRelated: 'God Has Given Trump Authority to Take Out Kim Jung-Un'\n\nPresident Trump and North Korean officials this week are exchanging bellicose words over the regime's nuclear missile program. Last month North Korea announced the successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach California.\n\nAt least three Americans remain in North Korean custody: businessman Kim Dong-chul, academic Kim Sang-duk and self-described Christian missionary Kim Hak-song.\n\nHak-song, who was taken into custody in May, taught at Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. The university, founded in 2010 with donations from South Korean and American Christians, including the Illinois-based Church of the Brethren, remains the only private university in the country.\n\nThe American nonprofit Open Doors, which advocates for persecuted Christians worldwide, lists North Korea as the most oppressive nation for Christians in the world. It estimates that there are 300,000 Christians in the nation of 25 million.", "time": "18:03:00"}

If you'd like to learn more...\n\nIn his official statement following North Korea's release from prison of a Canadian pastor, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanked his security adviser, who led the Canadian delegation to North Korea and ... Sweden.\n\nWhy Sweden, you ask?\n\nAs Trudeau put it, the Nordic country is Canada's \"protecting power\" in North Korea, a not uncommon diplomatic relationship that exists when one country (in this case, Canada) doesn't have a diplomatic mission in another (North Korea, in this case).\n\nWATCH: Parishioners react after Pastor Hyeon Soo Lim's release\n\nStory continues below Canada-North-Korea relations\n\nCanada recognizes North Korea, but describes it as an authoritarian state with dynastic government. Diplomatic ties between the countries were established in 2001, but short-lived, and neither country built an embassy before ties were cut in 2010.\n\nThough Canada recommends against it, travel with a Canadian passport to North Korea is not prohibited. However, considering North Korea's \"highly repressive regime,\" as Global Affairs Canada has put it, tourists can easily find themselves on the wrong side of the law and in need of consular assistance.\n\nREAD MORE: Canadian pastor 'on his way home' after years in North Korea prison, family says\n\nWith severed diplomatic ties and no embassy in North Korea, though, Canada has designated Sweden as its protecting power.\n\n\"There is no resident Canadian government office in the country. The ability of Canadian officials to provide consular assistance in North Korea is extremely limited,\" the federal government warns online.\n\nSix Canadians were registered as of Aug. 3 with Ottawa as being in North Korea, Global Affairs Canada said.\n\nWATCH: Ontario MPP Raymond reflects on friendship with Canadian pastor after release from North Korea\n\nEstablishing protective powers\n\nBoth the host and protected state have to agree on which country will provide services - ideally, it is a relatively neutral country that has diplomatic ties with both countries.\n\nAfter Canada shuttered its Iranian embassy in Tehran and ordered all Iranian diplomats to leave Canada, the government turned to Italy.\n\nREAD MORE: Canadian pastor detained in North Korea granted meeting with Swedish ambassador\n\nDays later, Italy's foreign minister announced his government would protect Canadian interests in Iran.\n\nIn North Korea, Sweden carries out most of the diplomatic functions not only for Canada, but also for the United States and Australia.\n\nBut the U.S. State Department warned American citizens this week that North Korea still \"routinely delays or denies\" consular access even when the Swedish Embassy makes the request.\n\nAt least 16 U.S. citizens have been detained in North Korea in the past ten years, according to the U.S. State Department.", "time": "18:21:00"}

That too, was God's grace,\" pastor Hyeon Soo Lim said in a Korean address to his Mississauga church Sunday.\n\nReleased Canadian pastor Hyeon Soo Lim on Sunday spoke in Korean to the congregation of the Light Presbyterian Chruch in Mississauga about how he survived his ordeal in a North Korean prison. Lim was released after 2 \u00bd years spent in North Korean custody earlier this week.\n\nIn his remarks, he thanked the members of his church and the government for securing his release.\n\nHere is a translation of Lim's prepared statement, provided by the church Sunday:\n\nI am so grateful that God has allowed me to be here with everyone here today. I want to earnestly thank Prime Minister Trudeau for helping in my return home. I also extend a very special thanks to Special Advisor Daniel Jean and the delegation for securing my release In addition, thank you to Minister Freeland, former Minister Dion, Senator Yonah Martin and all the incredible staff in Ottawa. I also want to thank the Swedish Government for being Canada's protecting power in North Korea, and for playing a critical role in my release.\n\nI am grateful for my church community. I'm indebted to all the churches in Canada, the United States and in Korea -- the many friends around the world who have prayed daily for two years and seven months, until the moment I was released and returned home. Through those prayers and the efforts of all involved, I finally came home yesterday, landing at 10 a.m. on Canadian soil. It still feels like a dream. Truly, this is all by the grace of God.\n\nI was sentenced to death by North Korea but the sentence was commuted to life of hard labour. That too, was God's grace, and gave me tremendous peace.\n\nFrom that moment, there were days of overwhelming loneliness. From the first day of my detainment until the day I was released, I ate 2,757 meals in isolation by myself. It was difficult to see when and how the entire ordeal would end. But this isolation also gave me the opportunity to spend an extended time of solitude with God.\n\nDuring the winter. I had to dig holes that measured one metre wide and one metre deep. The ground was frozen. The mud was so hard that it took two days to dig one hole. It was incredibly challenging. My upper body was sweating; my fingers and toes were frostbitten. I also worked inside a coal storage facility, breaking apart frozen coal.\n\nIn the spring and the summer, I worked outside, eight hours a day, in the scorching sun. One year of this difficult labour took a toll on my body and I was admitted to the hospital for two months. There would be three other occasions where I would be admitted to the hospital in serious condition.\n\nDuring my time there, I read over one hundred books on North Korea and began to grasp and gain a deeper understanding of the 70 year history that formed the nation. I also read the Bible in both English and Korean five times and memorized over 700 Bible verses. I worshipped alone for 130 Sundays.\n\nWhile I was laboring, I prayed without ceasing. I will share more details with you later.\n\nThere were many difficult moments but it was during these times that God gave me the strength endure and persevere. There were moments of discouragement, resentment, and grumbling but that soon changed into courage, joy, and thanksgiving.

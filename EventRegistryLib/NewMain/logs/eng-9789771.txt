This prediction is based on new research that attributes the weakening of AMOC to warmer ocean temperatures and disrupted salinity levels, caused by human-induced climate change. The study, which is currently under peer review, used advanced modeling to estimate this potential collapse could happen between 2037 and 2064.\n\nThe research indicates a higher probability of the AMOC collapsing by 2050. Rene van Westen, a marine and atmospheric researcher at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and co-author of the study, expressed concern over this finding. He warned that an AMOC collapse would exacerbate the negative effects of climate change.\n\nThe AMOC plays a crucial role in global weather patterns and climate. It functions like a conveyor belt, pulling warm surface water from the southern hemisphere and the tropics, and distributing it in the cold North Atlantic. The colder, saltier water then sinks and flows south. This mechanism prevents parts of the Southern Hemisphere from overheating and parts of the Northern Hemisphere from becoming exteremely cold, while distributing nutrients that sustain marine life.\n\nAn AMOC collapse could have disastrous effects on global weather patterns. It could lead to Arctic ice extending down to the southern coast of England after a century and cause significant drops in average temperatures in Europe and parts of North America. Additionally, the Amazon rainforest could experience a complete reversal in its seasons.\n\nThe researchers from Utrecht used advanced models and identified an area of the South Atlantic Ocean as the optimal place to monitor for changes in the circulation. They studied temperatures and ocean saltiness in this region to confirm previous predictions on when the AMOC might reach its tipping point. An AMOC collapse \"is a really big danger that we should do everything we can to avoid,\" said Stefan Rahmstorf, a physical oceanographer at Potsdam University in Germany.", "source": {"uri":

The colder, saltier water then plunges to the ocean floor and flows south.\n\nThis cyclical motion not only prevents the Southern Hemisphere from overheating and the Northern Hemisphere from freezing over but also disperses life-nourishing nutrients throughout marine ecosystems.\n\nResearch into these vital currents has been intense and ongoing. In recent years, multiple studies have proposed the disturbing theory that the AMOC could be heading towards a catastrophic failure, weakened by rising ocean temperatures and disrupted salinity levels - the chilling aftermath of human-induced climate change.\n\nThe prognosis of this recent research stands out as it provides an estimated timeframe for the potential collapse of the AMOC. According to the data, the shutdown could transpire as soon as 2037 and as late as 2064.\n\nThe findings further suggest that there is more than a 50% chance of the currents collapsing before we reach the middle of this century.\n\nThe urgency and precision of this prediction are unprecedented, sounding alarms among many within the scientific community and beyond.\n\nThe detailed forecast has heightened concerns and spurred intense discussions about the potential global impact, emphasizing the need for immediate action and comprehensive climate strategies to mitigate the impending crisis.\n\nStudy co-author Ren\u00e9 van Westen is an atmospheric and marine researcher.based at the University of Utrecht.\n\n\"This is really worrying,\" said van Westen. \"All the negative side effects of anthropogenic climate change, such as more heat waves, more droughts, and more flooding, will continue. If you add an AMOC collapse on top of that, the climate will become even more distorted.\"\n\nPicture a world where the AMOC has ceased to function. It would hardly be recognizable as the one we know now.\n\nIn the wake of the collapse, Arctic ice would gradually advance southwards, enveloping the southern coast of England within a century.\n\nMean temperatures in Europe and parts of North America, including regions of the United States, would nosedive.\n\nIn an ironic twist, the Amazon rainforest's dry and rainy seasons would be completely inverted. Such a future, as we can all agree, is one we should strive to avoid.\n\nThe Utrecht University team utilized cutting-edge models and - for the first time - highlighted an area within South Atlantic Ocean as the prime location to monitor any changes in the circulation.\n\nThey analyzed temperatures and ocean salinity in this region, aiming to narrow down when the AMOC might reach its tipping point.\n\nHowever, melting Greenland ice - which is disrupting the circulation's driving force of salt, is insufficiently considered - which might lead to underestimation of the speed and onset of the collapse.\n\nUntil just a few years ago, the possibility of an AMOC collapse was considered a \"low-probability, high-impact risk.\" But now, it's seen as a highly likely event within this century.\n\nThe swift advances in AMOC research and the rapid evolution of models predicting its collapse underscore the urgency of this growing threat.\n\nUltimately, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, Earth's lifeblood and climate regulator, is at a perilous crossroads. With over a 50% chance of collapse before 2050, the need for swift, decisive action to mitigate the effects of our changing climate has never been more urgent.\n\n-- -\n\nLike what you read?

"body": "(The Hill) -- Four key pillars of the global climate are melting in the heat trapped by rising fossil fuel emissions, a new study has found.\n\nThe relatively stable climate that nurtured human civilization depends in large part on these structures: the ice sheets of Greenland and West Antarctica, the Amazon rainforest and the Atlantic currents that warm Europe.\n\nUnder current policies, the world faces a scenario in which those pillars have roughly even odds of either surviving or collapsing during the next three centuries, according to results published on Thursday in Nature Communications.\n\nThe scientists warned that if the pillars are fatally undermined by heat, the resulting damage could prove impossible to undo -- even if temperatures are successfully brought down later in the 21st century.\n\nEven so, the long timeline of those findings makes them, if anything, optimistic relative to other recent ones: They come on the heels of a string of disturbing studies about key global systems like the conveyor-belt Atlantic current that keeps Europe temperate, or the West Antarctic Ice Sheet that keeps global sea levels stable.\n\nExperts say nuclear energy bill is proof of bipartisan consensus\n\nThe Nature study found that the four \"pillars\" it focused on -- the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current (AMOC), the Amazon rainforest and the vast but melting Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheets -- are interconnected, like a row of dominoes.\n\nAnd the risk of those dominoes toppling increases with every 0.1 Celsius (about 0.2 Fahrenheit) of additional heat above the red line of 2 degrees Celsius set in the Paris climate agreement, the researchers wrote.\n\nThey found that that risk is most urgent for the Atlantic current, which could tip into collapse within the next 15 years, and the Amazon rainforest, which could begin a runaway process of conversion to fire-prone grassland by the 2070s.\n\n\"Following current policies this century would commit to a 45 percent tipping risk by 2300, even if temperatures are brought back to below 1.5 [Celsius],\" they wrote.\n\nBecause they serve as bulwarks of the modern climate.\n\nEach of these pillars is stabilized by, and contribute to, much larger patterns in the global climate and human civilization -- as well as the other pillars.\n\nTake the AMOC: It functions as a conveyor belt that brings warm water from the tropics up into the North Atlantic, causing Europe to experience much warmer temperatures than Canada.\n\nThe current's weakening or failure would trap more hot water in the southern ocean, generating more hurricanes and speeding the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets, and lead to something like cataclysm for European agriculture -- the sort of catastrophe for which preparation is of little use.\n\n\"You cannot adapt to this,\" the University of Copenhagen's Peter Ditlevsen, who co-authored a Nature study last year on the potential midcentury collapse of the AMOC with his sister Susanne, told Inside Climate News.\n\nIf that collapse occurs, he told Inside Climate, there are \"studies of what happens to agriculture in Great Britain, and it becomes like trying to grow potatoes in Northern Norway.\"\n\nSimilarly, the Amazon stabilizes global climates and regional temperatures, locking down planet-heating greenhouse gasses and generating rain that waters fields as far away as the U.S. Midwest.\n\nAnd the full collapse of the cubic miles of ice in the Greenland Ice Sheet -- whose melting is one of the principal sources of current sea level rise -- would lead those levels to climb 23 feet, according to NASA.\n\nThe Nature study builds upon prior research that suggested human civilization was brushing up against a wide array of potential tipping points.\n\nThere was the Ditlevsens' finding last year that the AMOC was both slowing down and beginning to wander more -- both \"early-warning signs\" for a collapse that they estimated could come as soon as midcentury.\n\nThat was bolstered by February findings in Science that confirmed such tipping in the AMOC was a real possibility.\n\nThis was \"bad news for the climate system and humanity,\" the authors of that study noted, because up until recently scientists could hope that AMOC tipping was \"only a theoretical concept\" that would vanish once scientists took a global view of the climate system and all its circling feedback loops.\n\nIf the AMOC collapsed, the Science authors suggested, there would be \"strong and rapid cooling of the European climate\" of 3 degrees Celsius, or up to 5 degrees Fahrenheit per decade -- a level that, echoing Ditlevsen, the scientists said \"no realistic adaptation measures can deal with.\"\n\nAlso in February, a study in Nature found that as much as half of the Amazon -- a forest that dates back to the age of the terrestrial dinosaurs -- could be the site of \"compounding disturbances\" by midcentury that could lead to the sudden transition from forest to savanna.\n\nThat's a possibility one study author told Carbon Brief was \"very scary.\"\n\nAnd a 2020 study in Nature found that at about 2 degrees Celsius of warming -- the upper limit set in Paris -- the Antarctic Ice Sheet would be \"committed to long-term partial collapse.\"\n\nThe danger to the ice sheet, and to these key systems in general, is what scientists call \"hysteresis\" -- a dynamic that can be thought of as a door that only swings one way. Once collapse occurs, it will be impossible to reverse, even if temperatures are brought back down in the future.\n\nConsiderable research suggests that the systems examined in the Nature study are closely interwoven with one another, creating the risk of \"climate domino effects,\" as a 2021 study in Earth System Dynamics put it.\n\nThat risk is not clear cut: Interactions between the pillars cut both ways, and in some scenarios collapse in one could lead to greater stability for others, rather than a cascade of failure.\n\nCalifornia's housing crisis could be raising risk of climate disasters, researchers fear\n\nFor example, on the one hand, the frigid fresh water streaming down from a collapsing Greenland ice sheet might destabilize the AMOC; on the other, a similar collapse of the Antarctic ice sheet could stabilize it.\n\nThere is also some evidence suggesting that a faltering AMOC could help halt the \"dieback\" of the Amazon, though researchers emphasize that the salvation would be paid for with \"devastating impacts globally.\"\n\nBut these potential saving graces in scenarios of collapse underscore the consistent risk raised by the scientific literature in this field: Even experts don't really know how close we are to destabilizing the systems we rely on.\n\nThese risks go beyond the four earth systems that Thursday's study looked at. One 2022 Science study into the risk of failure of nine key Earth systems -- which include the thawing of methane-dense permafrost and coral reef die-off -- found that collapse was possible even at 1 Celsius of warming.\n\nThat is a level the planet has already surpassed, though the scientists noted that every fraction of a degree of heat brought the danger closer.\n\nScientists posit that the most important step for mitigating the risk of collapse is to slow global heating -- which is effectively melting the diverse structures of the Earth's atmosphere, cryosphere and biosphere toward a dangerously soupy sameness -- or to blunt its effects.\n\nSome recent strategies they've proposed to do so verge on science fiction.\n\nOver the last several years, there has been a surge of interest in solar geoengineering, which pursues approaches like brightening clouds to reflect more of the sun's light and heat back into space, away from an atmosphere that is ever more polluted with heat-trapping emissions from fossil fuels.\n\nFor example, the Environmental Defense Fund and the University of Chicago each recently stood up working groups on the technology.\n\nSolar geoengineering is controversial, however. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists compared it to deliberately mirroring the heat-blocking impacts of volcanic eruptions or pollution from coal plants.\n\nRecent research suggests that deflecting the sun's light back into space would be, at best, a stopgap: A June study in Nature found that \"marine cloud brightening\" could cut the risk of dangerous summer temperatures by as much as 55 percent over the continental U.S. -- but only over the short term.\n\nBy mid-century, the study found, the method would only slightly reduce, or even increase, \"heat stress in the Western United States and across the world\" -- in part because of how the AMOC would respond to both ongoing planetary heating and the impacts of decreased sunlight.\n\nPerhaps more controversial than solar geoengineering, according to Science Magazine, is the strategy discussed in a July white paper, also from the University of Chicago, in which a team of polar scientists called for research into massive dams, boreholes and barriers that could help slow the melting of the ice sheets.\n\nSuch measures could help block ice sheets from the heated ocean water that melts them or drain away the pools of meltwater that would otherwise lubricate their slide into a warming sea.\n\nBut they're the subject of much contention among scientists.\n\n\"I honestly feel like this is ultimately going to be a civil war in the community,\" University of Michigan glaciologist Jeremy Bassis told Science. \"I don't see an awful lot of room for compromise.\"\n\nThese proposals are controversial in part because of their expense, lack of proven outcomes and potential for unforeseen consequences -- but also because many scientists see them as a distraction from the most obvious solution, which is drastically reducing the main force driving the heating: the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nSurvey: 9 in 10 Americans support proposed worker heat protection rules\n\nA 2022 study in Nature Climate Change, for example, found that only cutting emissions in half by 2030 could \"minimize risks\" of tipping points for the world's ice sheets.\n\nEchoing the upshot of most papers on the topic, the authors of Thursday's study emphasized the need for rapid cuts in emissions.\n\nThey said to avoid the risk of tipping points, human society needed to \"at least\" zero out greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the century, a process that they emphasized had to begin now.\n\nRapid cuts in emissions by 2030 \"are critical for planetary stability,\" they wrote.\n\nThey're not moving fast enough.\n\nLast year saw record emissions from fossil fuels, according to scientists at the Global Carbon Budget, which tracks the amount of coal, oil and gas that can still be burned without pushing Earth beyond a greater than 50 percent chance of passing the critical 1.5 Celsius threshold.\n\nAs of 2024, that budget stands at 275 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide -- an amount that human civilization is on track to burn through within the next seven years.\n\nThere is some evidence that global fossil fuel emissions will peak this year, but even if they do, the decline is likely to be gradual and may be outweighed by other factors, such as deforestation -- or an expansion in the production of such fuels.\n\nA 2023 report by the Stockholm Environment Institute found that world government fossil fuel production plans, if met, would by 2030 produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels necessary to keep planetary heating below 1.5 Celsius, and more than half again as much as would keep it below 2 Celsius.\n\nBoth those numbers potentially surpass the level at which tipping points begin to be a risk.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Naturally, many scientists have put a lot of effort into trying to find out how close we are to these points, but a new study claims we simply don't know. There is too much uncertainty to tell whether those tipping points are close or many billions of tonnes of carbon emissions away, the authors conclude, making caution a priority.\n\nComplex systems - of which the climate is certainly one - can shift from one relatively stable state to another, at which point it becomes very difficult to return. A common example is when rainforest dries out to the point it becomes first dry open woodland, and then savanna. Even if the wet conditions that previously sustained the forest return, the rainforest will not (without additional inputs, which are often quite large).\n\nMany tipping points are local, but a few of global significance have haunted climate scientists for decades. Most or all of the Amazon Rainforest experiencing the shift described above is one. Some of the planet's glaciers retreating past certain hold points is another. The accelerated melting of tundra permafrost and ocean methane hydrates and the collapse of the Atlantic Meridian Overturning Circulation (AMOC) are the others that draw the most attention, although the collapse of stratocumulus clouds is also lurking.\n\nWe know these have all tipped before, and in many cases have witnessed smaller counterparts do it in recent times.\n\nIf we added enough greenhouse gasses to the atmosphere, all of these would probably happen, and life would become unbearable for most of humanity. According to the study authors, however, we have little chance of knowing what would be required to trigger each.\n\nThe scientists conclude there are three main sources of uncertainty in our estimates of what would trigger each tipping point.\n\nFor one, our models of the physical mechanisms behind the tipping points are at least somewhat simplistic and may not fully capture the reasons past tips occurred. In addition, our observations of the relevant systems may not always be as representative as those making models of these systems assume.\n\nFinally, historical data - both from direct observations and from climate proxies such as tree rings - cover only a fraction of the locations and times needed to understand past behavior. Efforts to fill in the gaps statistically are not as reliable as some researchers think.\n\nThe authors delve more deeply into AMOC as an example of widespread challenges. A previous study concluded AMOC will collapse between 2025 and 2095 if carbon emissions continue at projected rates. Seventy years is a wide margin of error, but the researchers don't think even this is enough. They show there are at least three methods to predict when AMOC - which helps keep northern Europe warm - and the entire ocean current system might collapse. Using all three, rather than just one as others have done, but with different starting assumptions, they conclude such a disaster could occur any time between 2050 and 8065. Even that broad range assumes we have the underlying causes of past collapses right, which may not be the case, and on one modeling method, AMOC might not tip at all.\n\n\"Although some of the quantitative results of this work are specific to the AMOC, we show that these types of uncertainties will be present in any attempt to extrapolate a future tipping time of proposed Earth system tipping elements from historical data,\" the authors write.\n\n\"Our research is both a wake-up call and a cautionary tale,\" lead author Maya Ben-Yami said in a statement. \"There are things we still can't predict, and we need to invest in better data and a more in-depth understanding of the systems in question. The stakes are too high to rely on shaky predictions.\"\n\nInevitably, some will take this as a license to keep on polluting, but co-author Professor Niklas Boers argues the opposite. \"We still need to do everything we can to reduce our impact on the climate, first and foremost by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Even if we can't predict tipping times, the probability for key Earth system components to tip still increases with every tenth of a degree of warming,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, the work should act as a counter to those who argue it is already too late to stop climate collapse, and we should either abandon society or party for the few years we have left.", "source": {"uri": "iflscience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFLScience"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_meridional_overturning_circulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic meridional overturning circulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipping_points_in_the_climate_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tipping points in the climate system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainforest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rainforest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complex system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savanna", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Savanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_rainforest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon rainforest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tonne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Woodland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_clathrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Methane clathrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dendrochronology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_(climate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy (climate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tundra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tundra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Permafrost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glacier", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glacier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maya civilization"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Catastrophes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Voluntary_Simplicity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Voluntary Simplicity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/75418/aImg/78002/aerial-photograph-of-a-melting-iceberg-in-ilulissat-greenland-meta.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789771", "eventUri": "eng-9789771", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

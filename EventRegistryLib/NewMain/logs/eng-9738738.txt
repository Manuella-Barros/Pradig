(AP) -- A Montana judge said Tuesday that the Secretary of State's Office erred in changing the rules governing whose signatures should count on petitions for three constitutional initiatives -- including one to protect abortion rights -- after officials tried to omit the signatures of inactive voters.\n\nDistrict Judge Mike Menahan said he would give county election offices another week to tally signatures of inactive voters that had been rejected, saying they should count. All of the initiatives are expected to qualify for the November ballot.\n\nTwo organizations sued Republican Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen after her office, in response to a question from a county election officer, said the signatures of voters who were considered \"inactive\" should not count toward the number of signatures needed to place initiatives on the ballot.\n\nThe change was made after the signatures had been turned in to counties and after some of the signatures had been verified.\n\nThane Johnson, an attorney representing Jacobsen's office, argued that a ruling wasn't urgently needed. Johnson noted that supporters of the abortion initiative, another to hold open primaries and a third to require candidates to obtain a majority vote to win a general election had already turned in more than enough signatures to qualify, even without signatures from inactive voters. Johnson also argued that voters weren't being disenfranchised by their signature being rejected from a petition.\n\nMenahan said Montana's constitution offers a robust provision for citizens to pass initiatives and constitutional amendments.\n\n\"When you're talking about the rights of people to participate in government, that's a fundamental right that I think, as a judge, my duty is to uphold that right and give life to it and preserve it,\" Menahan said in saying he would grant a temporary restraining order.\n\nHe said he did not want to issue an order that would cause more difficulties for the counties that must turn in signature counts by Friday's deadline, or for the Secretary of State's Office that must certify the ballots by Aug. 22, but he wanted the inactive voters' signatures to be included.\n\nHe left it up to attorneys for both sides to reach an agreement on the details and said he would sign the order. The attorneys were meeting Tuesday afternoon.\n\nA hearing on a permanent injunction is set for July 26.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the state had, for nearly three decades, accepted the petition signatures of \"inactive voters,\" defined as those who fail to vote in a general election and who haven't responded to efforts to confirm their mailing address. They can be restored to active voter status by confirming their address, showing up at the polls to vote or by requesting an absentee ballot.\n\nA week after the deadline to turn in petitions to counties, Jacobsen's office told an election clerk that she should not accept the signatures of inactive voters. The clerk emailed the response to other clerks.\n\nOn July 2, Jacobsen's office changed the statewide voter database to prevent counties from verifying the signatures of inactive voters.\n\nMontanans Securing Reproductive Rights and Montanans for Election Reform filed the lawsuit last week.\n\nThe Montana Republican Party opposes the efforts to protect abortion rights and hold open primaries.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Austin Knudsen had issued opinions stating the proposed ballot language for the nonpartisan primary and abortion protection were insufficient.\n\nKnudsen re-wrote the abortion language to say the proposed amendment, in part, would \"allow post-viability abortions up to birth,\" \"eliminates the State's compelling interest in preserving prenatal life,\" and \"may increase the number of taxpayer-funded abortions.\"\n\nSupporters appealed his opinions to the Montana Supreme Court and petition language was approved. The justices ended up writing the petition language for the abortion initiative themselves.\n\n\"Every step of the way, both initiatives, have had to go to the Supreme Court multiple times to get on the ballot,\" said Graybill, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, who is representing Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights. \"We couldn't even get our petition form until we sued them

(AP) - A Montana judge said Tuesday that the Secretary of State\u00b4s Office erred in changing the rules governing whose signatures should count on petitions for three constitutional initiatives - including one to protect abortion rights - after officials tried to omit the signatures of inactive voters.\n\nDistrict Judge Mike Menahan said he would give county election offices another week to tally signatures of inactive voters that had been rejected, saying they should count. All of the initiatives are expected to qualify for the November ballot.\n\nTwo organizations sued Republican Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen after her office, in response to a question from a county election officer, said the signatures of voters who were considered \"inactive\" should not count toward the number of signatures needed to place initiatives on the ballot.\n\nThe change was made after the signatures had been turned in to counties and after some of the signatures had been verified.\n\nThane Johnson, an attorney representing Jacobsen's office, argued that a ruling wasn't urgently needed. Johnson noted that supporters of the abortion initiative, another to hold open primaries and a third to require candidates to obtain a majority vote to win a general election had already turned in more than enough signatures to qualify, even without signatures from inactive voters. Johnson also argued that voters weren't being disenfranchised by their signature being rejected from a petition.\n\nMenahan said Montana's constitution offers a robust provision for citizens to pass initiatives and constitutional amendments.\n\nLewis and Clark District Court Judge Mike Menehan speaks during a temporary restraining order hearing in a suit against the Montana Secretary of State brought by Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights and Montanans for Election Reform over ballot initiative signature exclusions on Tuesday, July 16, 2024 at the Lewis and Clark County Courthouse in Helena, Mont. (Thom Bell/Independent Record via AP)\n\n\"When you're talking about the rights of people to participate in government, that's a fundamental right that I think, as a judge, my duty is to uphold that right and give life to it and preserve it,\" Menahan said in saying he would grant a temporary restraining order.\n\nHe said he did not want to issue an order that would cause more difficulties for the counties that must turn in signature counts by Friday's deadline, or for the Secretary of State's Office that must certify the ballots by Aug. 22, but he wanted the inactive voters' signatures to be included.\n\nHe left it up to attorneys for both sides to reach an agreement on the details and said he would sign the order. The attorneys were meeting Tuesday afternoon.\n\nA hearing on a permanent injunction is set for July 26.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that the state had, for nearly three decades, accepted the petition signatures of \"inactive voters,\" defined as those who fail to vote in a general election and who haven\u00b4t responded to efforts to confirm their mailing address. They can be restored to active voter status by confirming their address, showing up at the polls to vote or by requesting an absentee ballot.\n\nA week after the deadline to turn in petitions to counties, Jacobsen's office told an election clerk that she should not accept the signatures of inactive voters. The clerk emailed the response to other clerks.\n\nOn July 2, Jacobsen's office changed the statewide voter database to prevent counties from verifying the signatures of inactive voters.\n\nMontanans Securing Reproductive Rights and Montanans for Election Reform filed the lawsuit last week.\n\nThe Montana Republican Party opposes the efforts to protect abortion rights and hold open primaries.\n\nRepublican Attorney General Austin Knudsen had issued opinions stating the proposed ballot language for the nonpartisan primary and abortion protection were insufficient.\n\nKnudsen re-wrote the abortion language to say the proposed amendment, in part, would \"allow post-viability abortions up to birth,\" \"eliminates the State\u00b4s compelling interest in preserving prenatal life,\" and \"may increase the number of taxpayer-funded abortions.\"\n\nSupporters appealed his opinions to the Montana Supreme Court and petition language was approved. The justices ended up writing the petition language for the abortion initiative themselves.\n\n\"Every step of the way, both initiatives, have had to go to the Supreme Court multiple times to get on the ballot,\" said Graybill, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, who is representing Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights. \"We couldn't even get our petition form until we sued them to get the petition form.\"\n\nLewis and Clark District Court Judge Mike Menehan hear arguments during a temporary restraining order hearing in a suit against the Montana Secretary of State brought by Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights and Montanans for Election Reform over ballot initiative signature exclusions on Tuesday, July 16, 2024 in the Lewis and Clark County Courthouse in Helena, Mont.

(AP) -- An initiative to ask voters if they want to protect the right to a pre-viability abortion in Montana's constitution has enough signatures to appear on the November ballot, supporters said Friday.\n\nCounty election officials have verified 74,186 voter signatures, more than the 60,359 needed for the constitutional initiative to go before voters. It has also met the threshold of 10% of voters in 51 House Districts -- more than the required 40 districts, Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights said.\n\n\"We're excited to have met the valid signature threshold and the House District threshold required to qualify this critical initiative for the ballot,\" Kiersten Iwai, executive director of Forward Montana and spokesperson for Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights said in a statement.\n\nStill pending is whether the signatures of inactive voters should count toward the total.\n\nMontana's secretary of state said they shouldn't, but it didn't make that statement until after the signatures were gathered and after some counties had begun verifying them.\n\nA Helena judge ruled Tuesday that the qualifications shouldn't have been changed midstream and said the signatures of inactive voters that had been rejected should be verified and counted. District Judge Mike Menahan said those signatures could be accepted through next Wednesday.\n\nThe state has asked the Montana Supreme Court to overturn Menahan's order, but it will have no effect on the initiative qualifying for the ballot.\n\n\"We will not stop fighting to ensure that every Montana voter who signed the petition has their signature counted,\" Iwai said. \"The Secretary of State and Attorney General have shown no shame in pulling new rules out of thin air, all to thwart the will of Montana voters and serve their own political agendas.\"\n\nRepublican Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen must review and tabulate the petitions and is allowed to reject any petition that does not meet statutory requirements. Jacobsen must certify the general election ballots by Aug. 22.\n\nThe issue of whether abortion was legal was turned back to the states when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022.\n\nMontana's Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that the state constitutional right to privacy protects the right to a pre-viability abortion.

(By Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)\n\nThe Montana Secretary of State can't automatically reject signatures of \"inactive\" voters who signed petitions to place Constitutional initiatives on the ballot, a Lewis and Clark County District Court judge ruled Tuesday, as he granted a temporary restraining order.\n\nOne initiative would make it a constitutional right in Montana to make one's own decisions about pregnancy, including abortion, and two others would change the way elections are won in the state.\n\nAt a hearing Tuesday, lawyer Martha Sheehy said the Secretary of State's decision to change which signatures count on a petition was \"particularly galling\" for Montanans for Election Reform, a group proposing to \"increase meaningful voter access and participation.\"\n\nBut a lawyer for the Secretary of State argued the situation wasn't an emergency for that group or for Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights. Lawyer Thane Johnson said the number of \"inactive\" signatures was minimal, and the initiatives were headed for the ballot anyway.\n\n\"Inactive\" voters are people who are legally registered to vote but have had an address change or didn't vote in two election years.\n\nJudge Mike Menahan, however, said his focus wasn't on whether the initiatives from those two groups would qualify for the ballot. Rather, he said, Montanans have a fundamental right to participate in their government, and that includes signing a petition for a Constitutional initiative.\n\n\"As a judge, my duty is to uphold that right and give life to it and preserve it,\" Menahan said.\n\nHe said he believed the groups had made the case Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen shouldn't toss \"inactive\" signatures in the middle of counting based on a new interpretation. He said doing so changed a standard that had been in place nearly three decades -- and without notice.\n\n\"The troubling component here is that the process was underway,\" Menahan said.\n\nAlthough Menahan requested a temporary return to the status quo, he also said he didn't want to harm the process and would be \"as minimally involved as possible.\" He requested lawyers representing proponents for the initiatives and the state draft an order that ironed out the details; they did, and he electronically signed it Tuesday.\n\nIn a complaint last week, lawyers for the proponents asked the court to stop the Secretary of State from rejecting \"inactive\" signatures. They also asked the court to demand the Secretary of State restore the ones it had rejected.\n\nThe attorneys filed suit after they learned the Secretary of State had issued new instructions for which signatures counted and also reprogrammed a state database to automatically reject \"inactive\" signatures.\n\nLawyer Raph Graybill, representing Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights, said an anonymous tipster told a member of their group the Secretary of State had made the change. He said they hadn't received any notice about it beforehand, and they filed a request for public information under the Montana Constitution's \"right to know\" as a result.\n\nGraybill also is running as the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor.\n\nArguments on Tuesday focused in part on whether \"inactive\" voters are \"qualified electors.\" Graybill said a registered voter is a registered voter, and whether a person is on an \"active\" or \"inactive\" list is simply an administrative function that helps counties manage addresses.\n\n\"Inactive\" signatures\n\nIn court, lawyer Raph Graybill, representing Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights, outlined the different signature groups that needed to be accounted for.\n\nThey include ones counties reviewed after the Secretary of State issued its new directive June 28 but before software was blocking \"inactive\" signatures. They also include \"inactive\" signatures automatically rejected by the software system starting around July 2.\n\nGraybill said it's also important to ensure the Secretary of State doesn't belatedly toss out signatures that were already reviewed by counties and approved prior to the new interpretation.\n\nBoth \"active\" and \"inactive\" voters can both show up at the polls and vote, and both are qualified electors, as plainly defined in statute, he said. He said an \"inactive\" voter doesn't need to do anything besides show up to vote to become \"active.\"\n\nPlus, Graybill said the Secretary of State was still advising counties in a presentation on its own website to accept signatures of inactive electors because they are legally registered.\n\n\"If you go on the Secretary of State's website right now, today, at this hearing, you will find this slide,\" Graybill said.\n\nAdditionally, he said, signers of the petitions need to swear they're registered voters or face stiff penalties, but nowhere do they need to confirm whether they're \"active\" or \"inactive\" in a database.\n\nOn behalf of the Secretary of State, however, Johnson argued a comprehensive look at the statutes in question showed the new interpretation -- that \"inactive\" voters aren't \"qualified electors\" -- to be correct. Plus, he said, initiative proponents were going to succeed in clearing signatures thresholds anyway based on the plaintiffs' own calculations.\n\nJohnson said the groups failed in at least one criteria for a temporary restraining order: \"Your honor, that isn't even close to having an irreparable harm.\"\n\nJohnson called a couple of attorneys who work in the Secretary of State's office to testify, and one, Austin James, addressed a question from the judge. He agreed the state's software program could probably be programmed to help sort out some of the \"inactive\" voters it rejected, but he said time was running short.\n\n\"I really hope that the guys back at the office aren't gonna kill me,\" James said.\n\nClay Leland, the other lawyer called on behalf of the state, said the reason he issued the new interpretation was he was asked about it for the first time in June, following the passage of Senate Bill 498, regarding absentee ballots, in 2023.\n\nLeland said a look at that law, other statutes, and a case in Oregon helped him conclude \"inactive\" voters aren't \"qualified electors.\" He also said the Secretary of State's software was \"previously programmed incorrectly.\"\n\nUnder questioning from Graybill about the significance of the \"inactive\" designation, however, Leland admitted he couldn't point to the reason he believes an \"inactive\" voter needs to take extra steps to vote -- and get on the \"active\" list -- beyond simply showing up to vote.\n\nGraybill asked for the basis of his understanding that extra steps are necessary to vote if a person is \"inactive.\"\n\n\"The basis for that understanding? The basis to come to the conclusion that more information is needed is through a thorough analysis of that provision as well as other provisions throughout Montana code,\" Leland said.\n\nGraybill asked if another statute in state law set additional steps for inactive voters, and Leland said he wasn't aware of any \"off the top of my head,\" but he knew ones existed. Graybill had been looking at the \"reactivation\" statute, MCA 13-2-222, which says one way an inactive voter can get on the active list is to show up to vote.\n\n\"So there are other steps to take, but they're not in the statute, and you can't tell me what they are,\" Graybill said.\n\nSaid Leland: \"I would have to review the Montana code.\"\n\nAt one point while questioning Leland, Graybill asked to huddle with the judge and lawyers for the defendants: \"I am getting statutes recited to me. I am not getting answers,\" Graybill said.\n\nJudge Menahan said he appreciated the nod to changes the legislature made in 2023, but he said they didn't specifically indicate who would be a qualified elector for purposes of signing a ballot initiative.\n\nHe also said case law in Oregon, described by Leland as a \"sister state,\" wasn't any more important to Montana than case law in other states. Plus, he said, Montana has robust provisions when it comes to public participation.\n\n\"I think Montana looks to itself in determining its own constitution,\" Menahan said.\n\nA hearing on the request for a preliminary injunction will take place next Friday.\n\nReactions from Proponents of Constitutional Initiatives\n\nFrank Garner, Montanans for Election Reform board member and plaintiff in the lawsuit against Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen, issued the following statement following the conclusion of this morning's hearing:\n\n\"Today was an important first step in protecting the rights of registered Montana voters who want to participate in our citizen initiative process.\n\n\"The Secretary of State injected chaos and confusion into the validation process, and today's directive holds them to their own original guidance to validate the signatures of all registered voters. We commend our County Clerks and their staff for their hard work processing every single valid signature, and we will continue to fight for more voice and better choices for Montana voters.\"\n\nChristopher Coburn, president of Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights, said the following:\n\n\"Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights is pleased that the District Court affirmed that registered voters in Montana have the right to sign a citizen initiative petition and have their signature count. Today, the District Court correctly rejected politically motivated, last-minute, and secretive rule changes by the Secretary of State. While we needed to file a lawsuit to vindicate the rights of Montanans to participate in the ballot initiative process, today's decision ensures that from this point forward, the Secretary of State must facilitate a smooth, transparent, and legal qualification process for CI-128. Montanans deserve their voices to be heard on this issue, and we will continue to do everything we can to ensure Montanans can vote yes on CI-128 to protect their freedom to make abortion and pregnancy-related decisions without government interference.\"\n\nFrom the OrderUnder the Montana Constitution and state law, \"qualified electors\" may sign\n\ninitiative petitions and be counted, whether or not the elector appears on the\n\ninactive voter list, for the purposes of this temporary restraining order only.For the purposes of qualifying a ballot initiative, the Secretary shall not prevent\n\nthe verification or counting of the otherwise-valid signature of an elector who is\n\non the \"inactive voter\" rejected list.To minimize impact to the current counting of initiative petitions, the Secretary\n\nshall make no changes to the state software system related to the verification of\n\nsignatures prior to the July 19, 2024 deadline.Between July 20 and 21, 2024, the Secretary shall restore the state software\n\nsystem to allow the verification of inactive voters' signatures, such that county\n\nclerks may begin reviewing said voters on Monday, July 22, 2024.By 9:00 AM on Monday, July 22, 2024, the Secretary shall produce a report to\n\neach county of any inactive voters whose signatures were not verified. The\n\nreports shall include, for each rejected inactive voter, the petition number,\n\nsubmission number, page number, and line number.Counties, which are political subdivisions of Defendant the State of Montana,\n\nshall review the signatures of previously-rejected inactive voters, starting\n\nMonday, July 22, 2024, and shall submit them to the Secretary by 12:00 PM on\n\nJuly 24, 2024.The Secretary shall, through 12:00 PM on July 24, 2024, accept from counties and\n\ncount the signatures of any previously-rejected inactive voters identified above,\n\nwho have been verified by a county and submitted to the Secretary.The Court may revisit the 12:00 PM, July 24, 2024 deadline on receipt of clear\n\nand convincing evidence that a county is unable to meet this deadline.\n\nTemporary

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)\n\nThree ballot initiatives, two that could change the way candidates are selected in primary elections, as well as one to enshrine reproductive rights in the Montana Constitution, crossed an initial threshold, signaling that all three measures will likely be before voters in the 2024 general election in November.\n\nMontanans for Election Reform and Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights both announced Friday that Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen's official website showed that both groups had collected enough signatures to meet the legal threshold to go before voters.\n\nMontanans for Election Reform proposed and qualified two measures, Constitutional Initiatives 126 and 127. Montanans for Election Reform secured Constitutional Initiative 128.\n\nMontanans Securing Reproductive Rights said it had surpassed the minimum number of signatures needed. It need 60,359 signatures total, and that included a 10% of voters in 51 House Districts.\n\nMSRR said by 4 p.m. Friday CI-128 had 74,186 verified signatures, according to the Secretary of State's website.\n\nMeanwhile, Montanans for Election Reform had surpassed the total signature threshold as well as meeting the number of signatures in legislative districts.\n\nBoth groups report gathering more valid signatures than required to make it onto the ballot, even with counties still counting.\n\nThe news of the measures garnering enough signatures comes after a busy week in which Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Mike Menahan said that the Secretary of State should not be tossing out signatures from \"inactive\" voters. In his ruling, he said that an attorney for Jacobsen had suddenly -- and without notice -- determined that \"inactive\" voters, usually those who have changed addresses since voting, should not be counted.\n\nMenahan issued a temporary restraining order, stopping Jacobsen from acting on that interpretation, and ordered any signatures that had been rejected because of \"inactive\" voters to be restored.\n\nInactive voters can become active voters simply by showing up to vote, according to court testimony, and they are considered registered voters.\n\n\"We're excited to have met the valid signature threshold and the House District threshold required to qualify this critical initiative for the ballot,\" said Kiersten Iwai, executive director of Forward Montana and spokesperson for MSRR. \"Still, we will not stop fighting to ensure that every Montana voter who signed the petition has their signature counted. The Secretary of State and Attorney General have shown no shame in pulling new rules out of thin air, all to thwart the will of Montana voters and serve their own political agendas.\"\n\nJacobsen's office filed an emergency appeal to the Montana Supreme Court on Thursday, asking the state's highest court for a writ of supervisory control, which would take the case out of Menahan's hands, and allow the Supreme Court to decide the measure. The Montana Supreme Court has not made a determination on that appeal.\n\nFor now, Menahan's order remains in effect, and it requires the counties to continue to verify the signatures. During the weekend, the Montana Secretary of State said it will fix the software it changed to invalidate \"inactive\" signatures.\n\n\"Montanans across the state are celebrating the qualification of CI-126 and CI-127 for the ballot this November,\" said Frank Garner, Board member for Montanans for Election Reform, the bipartisan coalition working to pass these initiatives. \"We know County Clerks and their staff have been working tirelessly to process every single signature of each Montana citizen who wants more freedom, choice, and accountability in our elections, and we thank them for their commitment to the citizen initiative process. Despite recent attempts by the Secretary of State to take away the rights of registered Montana voters, today, the will of Montana citizens prevailed, and we will keep fighting for the right of every Montana voter to have their voice heard.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Montana counties will receive a list of rejected \"inactive\" voters and then will have until noon Wednesday to reprocess the signatures. According to a report generated by the office, there are 7,389 registered inactive voter signatures for CI-128.\n\nMontanans for Election Reform report that counties will need to reverify more than 8,700 signatures for CI-126 and CI-127.\n\nCI-126 and CI-127 deal with a new, top-four model for political candidates, and require a successful candidate for office to win with a majority, not a plurality.\n\nCI-128 protects the right to abortion in Montana, even though court decisions have affirmed the right to it, via the state's right to privacy. It would also prohibit the government from interfering with right the travel for medical services, as well as protect medical professionals' from government interference. It would protect abortion up until the point of fetal viability.\n\nThe three issues that have qualified for the ballot are all opposed by the Montana Republican Party. Jacobsen is a Republican running for re-election herself.\n\nConstitutional Initiative 126\n\nAmends the Montana Constitution to provide a top-four primary election. All candidates, regardless of political party, appear on one ballot. The four candidates receiving the most votes advance to the general election. A candidate may list a political party preference, but a candidate isn't required to be nominated by a political party. A candidate's political party preference isn't an endorsement by the political party. The legislature may require candidates gather signatures up to five percent of the votes received by the winning candidate in the last election to appear on the ballot. All voters may vote for one candidate for each covered office. The amendment applies to the elections for governor and lieutenant governor, secretary of state, auditor, attorney general, superintendent of public instruction, state representative, state senator, United State representative, and United States Senator.\n\nConstitutional Initiative 127\n\nAmends the Montana Constitution to provide that elections for certain offices must be decided by majority vote as determined as provided by law rather than by a plurality or the largest amount of the votes. If it cannot be determined who received a majority of votes because two or more candidates are tied, then the winner of the election will be determined as provided by law. This act applies to elections for governor and lieutenant governor, secretary of state, auditor, attorney general, superintendent of public instruction, state representative, state senator, United States representative, United States Senator, and other offices as provided by law.\n\nConstitutional Initiative 128\n\nA constitutional initiative that would amend the Montana Constitution to expressly provide a right to make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion. It would prohibit the government from denying or burdening the right to abortion before fetal viability. It would also prohibit the government from denying or burdening access to an abortion when a treating healthcare professional determines it is medically indicated to protect the pregnant patient's life or health. The initiative would prevent the government from penalizing patients, healthcare providers, or anyone who assists someone in exercising their right to make and carry out voluntary decisions about their pregnancy.\n\nSource: This information taken from the approved petition language from the Montana Secretary of State's website.\n\nThe post Three ballot measures cross signature threshold to be

(AP) -- An initiative to ask voters if they want to protect the right to a pre-viability abortion in Montana's constitution has enough signatures to appear on the November ballot, supporters said Friday.\n\nCounty election officials have verified 74,186 voter signatures, more than the 60,359 needed for the constitutional initiative to go before voters. It has also met the threshold of 10% of voters in 51 House Districts -- more than the required 40 districts, Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights said.\n\n\"We're excited to have met the valid signature threshold and the House District threshold required to qualify this critical initiative for the ballot,\" Kiersten Iwai, executive director of Forward Montana and spokesperson for Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights said in a statement.\n\nStill pending is whether the signatures of inactive voters should count toward the total.\n\nMontana's secretary of state said they shouldn't, but it didn't make that statement until after the signatures were gathered and after some counties had begun verifying them.\n\nA Helena judge ruled Tuesday that the qualifications shouldn't have been changed midstream and said the signatures of inactive voters that had been rejected should be verified and counted. District Judge Mike Menahan said those signatures could be accepted through next Wednesday.\n\nThe state has asked the Montana Supreme Court to overturn Menahan's order, but it will have no effect on the initiative qualifying for the ballot.\n\n\"We will not stop fighting to ensure that every Montana voter who signed the petition has their signature counted,\" Iwai said. \"The Secretary of State and Attorney General have shown no shame in pulling new rules out of thin air, all to thwart the will of Montana voters and serve their own political agendas.\"\n\nRepublican Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen must review and tabulate the petitions and is allowed to reject any petition that does not meet statutory requirements. Jacobsen must certify the general election ballots by Aug. 22.\n\nThe issue of whether abortion was legal was turned back to the states when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022.\n\nMontana's Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that the state constitutional right to privacy protects the right to a pre-viability abortion. But the Republican controlled Legislature passed several bills in 2023 to restrict abortion access, including one that says the constitutional right to privacy does not protect abortion rights.

Since the July 2 change, county elections officers have not been counting inactive voters and the county-level officials originally had until July 19 to count all petition signatures.\n\nFollowing Menahan's ruling, the inactive voters who signed the petitions are likely to be incorporated, but exactly how the Secretary of State's Office will be ordered to proceed is still being sorted out. Menahan stopped short of ordering the defense to recount inactive voters in a certain way, fearing that his order could complicate things further.\n\nInstead, attorneys for both sides are set to meet following Tuesday's hearing to discuss the exact provisions of the restraining order which will determine how the secretary of state and county election officials should proceed. The plaintiffs' attorneys, Raph Graybill and Martha Sheehy, requested an extension to the July 19 deadline that is fast approaching for county election administrators.\n\nMenahan's ruling came after a three-and-a-half-hour hearing in which the secretary of state's attorney called three witnesses, two of whom are staff attorneys for the secretary's office. The arguments mostly centered around who is defined as a \"qualified elector\" in Montana and if the plaintiffs did enough to show harm.\n\n\"[This case] turns entirely on what a qualified elector is, nothing beyond that,\" said Graybill, MSRR's attorney.\n\nUnder Montana law, only a \"qualified elector\" can sign a constitutional initiative, and attorneys for the state argued that someone who has been deemed an \"inactive voter\" is no longer a qualified elector.\n\nIt is common to become an inactive voter. Those who may have an out-of-date address with their county clerk's office or who have not voted in a recent federal general election will be deemed inactive.\n\nIt appears that the question of inactive voters was brought up after Crystal Cole, a Glacier County election officer, emailed the secretary of state asking if her office should count the signatures of inactive voters. A staff attorney with the secretary of state's office responded to her writing that an inactive voter \"does not appear to fit within the category of a 'qualified elector.'\" Days later, county election officials around the state received an email notification from the statewide elections software saying that because of an update to the system: \"For petitions: All inactive registrant signatures will now be automatically rejected with a rejected reason of inactive.\"\n\nThe defense argued that if the judge looks at the whole \"statutory scheme,\" then the secretary of state's staff attorneys were legally correct in barring elections officers from counting inactive voters.\n\n\"The reality is that you have a lawyer that is looking at this and frankly the question is, 'Did he get it right?' And I think if you take the whole statutory scheme, I think he got it right,\" said defense attorney Thane Johnson.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued the statute and constitutional provisions that define a qualified elector do not discern between inactive and active voters, and that an inactive voter is still a registered voter and was therefore able to sign the petitions these groups were circulating throughout the state.\n\nBoth Montana statute and the state's Constitution define a qualified elector as: \"Any citizen of the United States 18 years of age or older who meets the registration and residence requirements provided by law is a qualified elector unless he is serving a sentence for a felony in a penal institution or is of unsound mind, as determined by a court.\"\n\nThere are multiple ways for voters to move off the inactive list and onto the active list, including updating one's address with their local elections office or going to vote in person.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"An inactive elector can be \"reactivated,\" but not by signing a petition ... There is no lawful means of transitioning between inactive and active status by signing a petition,\" the defense wrote in its opening brief.\n\nPlaintiffs and Judge Menahan also took issue with the timing of the secretary's decision to void inactive voters, both saying that there have been \"decades\" worth of inactive voter signatures counted towards ballot initiatives before now.\n\n\"The troubling component here is that the process was underway ... the secretary of state then changed their program to do something entirely different,\" Menahan said.\n\nThe defense also tried to argue that the plaintiffs did not prove \"irreparable harm\" because the number of signatures that would be voided by disqualifying inactive voters would likely not be enough to tank the operation.\n\n\"Your honor, that isn't even close to having an irreparable harm,\" Johnson said of the relatively small number of signatories that would be disqualified. \"They're going to succeed according to their numbers and their burden of proof with regard to their petition ... and therein lies a huge problem. It is not right for this court to consider and it's not right for the court to issue a [temporary restraining order].\"\n\nGraybill pushed back on that assertion. He did not deny the relatively small number of signatures that are in the crosshairs, but instead argued that the ballot initiatives did not need to be disqualified for the plaintiffs to prove harm and that the individual inactive signatories are being harmed when their signatures are nixed.\n\n\"There is undoubtedly an injury to people who are inactive voters and signed this because they are entitled to sign and be counted and were excluded,\" Graybill said.\n\n\"It is not the case that you can only get relief when a right is totally defeated. A burden on a right ... is enough to obtain affirmative emergency relief from a court,\" he later added.\n\nThis lawsuit is just the latest in a string of complications for the ballot initiatives, and MSRR's Constitutional Initiative 128 has been most troubled by legal challenges. MSRR was ensnared in a months-long fight with Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen over the measure's language. Ultimately, the Montana Supreme Court stepped in, allowing MSRR to begin signature collection, albeit weeks later than planned.\n\nIt's also been a political football. Back in April, Republican legislators unanimously opposed the initiative. The vote did not substantively impact signature collection, but it was a sign of party opposition.\n\nLikewise, MER has also gotten backlash from Republicans, despite the fact that a number of former Republican lawmakers are behind the effort. The Montana GOP formed a task force to push back against MER's initiatives and the party's leaders have repeatedly spoken out against the effort.\n\nMER is bringing two separate but related initiatives. The first, CI-126, would implement what are called open primaries. The second, C1-127, would require a candidate to receive over 50% of the vote to win. Open primaries allow all qualified candidates to be on the same ballot regardless of political party with the top four from each office moving onto the general election.\n\n\"I think the SOS has to be seen as doing something about these initiatives,\" Rob Cook, a former Republican state representative and one of MER's leaders, previously told the Montana State News Bureau. \"Her revised guidance appears to me to be a Hail Mary, but she probably feels politically compelled to try something.\"\n\nMenahan said his approach was to move forward with a light touch but to honor the \"status quo.\"\n\n\"When you're talking about the rights of people to participate in government, that's a fundamental right that I think as a judge my duty is to uphold that right and give life to it and preserve it, so I don't want to do anything that would cause harm to this process,\" Menahan said as the hearing wound down. \"I want to be as minimally involved as possible, so I think I'm required to grant the injunction here just to preserve the status quo, but I don't want to do anything that would interfere with the county election administrators who are doing this process or the secretary of state.\"\n\nThe next hearing for the preliminary injunction (a more permanent ruling than a temporary restraining order) is currently set for Friday, July 26. The attorneys for the plaintiffs told the Montana State News Bureau that they believe they are likely to succeed in that hearing as well.\n\nVictoria Eavis is a reporter for the Montana State News Bureau.\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

Just this past month they've been the subject of two district court lawsuits in Lake and Lewis and Clark counties and a judicial standards board complaint.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The current number of inactive voters sits at 158,450 people compared to 599,608 active voters, according to the secretary of state's website.\n\nUnder Montana law, only a \"qualified elector\" can sign a constitutional initiative petition, and attorneys for the state argued that someone who has been deemed an \"inactive voter\" is no longer a qualified elector. In the filing with the Supreme Court, the secretary of state maintains that \"an inactive elector is someone whose registration could not be verified -- thereby not a legally registered elector until the issue is corrected.\n\n\"If the elector is not legally registered, they are not a qualified elector. If they are not a qualified elector, their signature on a petition for a constitutional initiative cannot be counted,\" the filing continues.\n\nHistorically, inactive voters have had their signatures counted towards petitions. What's more, in guidance on petition processing from Jacobsen's office, the training powerpoint instructs election administrators to \"accept the signatures of inactive electors, since they are legally registered.\"\n\nTo qualify a citizen-led constitutional initiative for the ballot, groups were required to collect just over 60,000 signatures across 40 legislative districts in Montana, a threshold both organizations previously said they met for their initiatives. Since the July 2 change, county elections officers have not been counting inactive voters and the county-level officials originally had until July 19 to count all petition signatures.\n\nJuly 2 falls in the midst of the signature counting process for county election officials, meaning that some of the inactive voter signatures were counted towards the petitions and some were not, but the language of the temporary restraining order is meant to ensure every valid signature is counted -- whether a voter is active or inactive.\n\nThe temporary restraining order that Menahan granted and was agreed upon by both parties stipulated that the secretary \"shall not prevent the verification or counting of the otherwise-valid signature of an elector who is on the 'inactive voter' rejected list.\"\n\nBetween July 20 and 21, \"the secretary shall restore the state software system to allow the verification of inactive voters' signatures,\" so the inactive signatories who were originally voided can be reviewed and submitted to the secretary by noon July 24.\n\n\"They manufactured a crisis when they altered the system on July 2nd,\" said Kendra Miller, a data consultant for the initiative groups.\n\nMiller was in the room when the two sides met for roughly an hour to discuss the temporary restraining order earlier this week, and she said that the order was \"jointly written and agreed to\" and that \"the tenor was positive.\"\n\nThe emergency petition with the Supreme Court requests swift intervention from the high court, asking the justices to vacate the temporary restraining order from the lower court and allow the \"counting of petition signatures to proceed according to Montana law.\"\n\nAttorneys for the secretary argue that Menahan did not have the authority \"to rewrite statutory election deadlines,\" in part because the plaintiffs did not invoke the statutes that govern those deadlines.\n\nThe filing with the Montana Supreme Court was not the only development in the case Thursday.\n\nSen. Barry Usher, R-Billings filed a complaint regarding Menahan with the body that fields complaints against judges, the Judicial Standards Commission, for his participation in the ballot initiative groups' case against the secretary of state. Menahan himself chairs the Judicial Standards Commission.\n\nUsher's complaint takes issue with the fact that Menahan served two terms in the Legislature as an elected Democrat and that while serving in the Legislature he received top ratings from abortion-rights groups like Planned Parenthood, which are now helping fund MSRR's constitutional initiative.\n\n\"Judge Menahan's partisan past likely does not present an issue in most cases that come before his court. Nor should one argue, that past partisan political activity should preclude someone from holding judicial office. However, this is not an ordinary case, this is exactly the type of situation the code of judicial conduct intended to avoid by setting the high ethical standing of avoiding even the appearance of impropriety,\" Usher wrote, adding that \"Judge Menahan should be sanctioned to the fullest extent possible.\"\n\nMenahan nor his chambers responded to request for comment Thursday, but earlier this week the Senate Select Committee on Judicial Oversight and Reform questioned Menahan in its meeting and the judge gave some indication of his stance on the accusations.\n\n\"I was wondering if you do keep that in your recusal list in your mind that you should probably recuse yourself from those, any bills that come up or cases that come up along those lines?\" Usher asked Menahan during the meeting.\n\nMenahan pointed out that he's not the first or only judge from either major party that previously held a partisan legislative seat before they were on the bench.\n\n\"All of them cast countless votes on bills that some entity had an interest, but once they became a judge, the rules related to them don't require them to recuse themselves on cases in which there was a policy interest years before at the Legislature,\" Menahan said to the committee. \"I feel that I've been away from the Legislature for a long-enough period of time that I might have insight into the process but I don't have a particular bias toward an outcome in any particular case other than to apply the law to the facts of those cases.\"\n\nThis judicial standards complaint is just the latest in a string of complications for the ballot initiatives, and MSRR's initiative has been most troubled by legal challenges. MSRR was ensnared in a months-long fight with Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen over the measure's language. Ultimately, the Montana Supreme Court stepped in, allowing MSRR to begin signature collection, albeit weeks later than planned.\n\nIt's also been a political football. Back in April, Republican legislators unanimously opposed the initiative. The vote did not substantively impact signature collection, but it was a sign of party opposition.\n\nLikewise, MER has also gotten backlash from Republicans, despite the fact that the effort is being supported by those of all political stripes including Republicans.\n\nMER is bringing two separate but related initiatives. The first, CI-126, would implement what are called open primaries. The second, C1-127, would require a candidate to receive over 50% of the vote to win. Open primaries allow all qualified candidates to be on the same ballot regardless of political party with the top four from each office moving onto the general election.\n\nThe Montana GOP formed a task force to push back against MER's initiatives and the party's leaders like chairman Don \"K\" Kaltschmidt have repeatedly spoken out against the effort. Late last month the party voted to officially oppose any ranked-choice voting efforts, a move triggered by MER's initiatives.\n\n\"Judge Menahan's decision to allow inactive voters' signatures to be counted on these petitions is absolutely reckless. He's failing to uphold the unambiguous wording of the laws implemented by the Legislature, which clearly understands the basic principles that you must be a qualified elector in order to cast a ballot or sign a petition,\" Kaltschmidt said in a statement. \"Judge Menahan made this ruling only to appease the Democrat party. Montana's qualified electors decide which candidates appear on their ballot, and they should also be the ones to decide which Constitutional Initiatives appear before them on Election Day.\"\n\nMontana State News Bureau Reporter Seaborn Larson contributed reporting.\n\nVictoria Eavis is a reporter for the Montana State News Bureau.\n\n0 Comments Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)\n\nMontana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen and Attorney General Austin Knudsen are asking the state Supreme Court to throw out a district court's order that restored the way signatures are counted for three Constitutional ballot initiatives that will like be before voters in 2024.\n\nOne initiative would ask voters to make abortion a Constitutionally protected right, and the other two would change the way elections are won.\n\nThe state is arguing a Lewis and Clark County District Court judge made numerous mistakes, the situation is an emergency, and the state Supreme Court should \"immediately\" take the reins \"and allow the orderly counting of petition signatures to proceed according to Montana law.\"\n\nA couple of groups supporting the initiatives, Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights and Montanans for Election Reform, argued Tuesday the Secretary of State unlawfully changed the rules -- midstream and without public notice -- to no longer count \"inactive\" voters toward the minimum number of signatures needed to place initiatives on the ballot.\n\nThey asked Lewis and Clark County District Court Judge Mike Menahan to order the Secretary of State to return to the status quo, in place for 27 years, and confirm that an \"inactive\" voter is still a qualified elector who can legally sign a petition.\n\nPeople listed as \"inactive\" are legally registered to vote but are identified as having had an address change or not having voted in a couple of years. One way they can become \"active\" is by voting.\n\nIn court the same day, Menahan agreed with proponents of the ballot measures. He said he wanted to be \"minimally involved,\" but had the duty to preserve the right of Montanans to participate in their government by signing petitions.\n\nThe Secretary of State argued the change took place in response to a question posed to the agency, and the new interpretation, based partly on a new law and readings of numerous statutes together, supported the change. Menahan disagreed.\n\n\"The troubling component here is that the process was underway,\" Menahan said.\n\nMenahan asked the lawyers from supporters of the initiatives and the Secretary of State's Office to draft an order that ironed out the details to ensure signatures from \"inactive\" voters would be counted, whether they had been rejected by counties or screened out by the Secretary of State's reprogrammed database.\n\nIn its petition filed Thursday, the Secretary of State made note of the judge's request the parties draft the proposed temporary restraining order.\n\n\"The District Court informed the parties it intended to enter a (temporary restraining order), but did not know how to draft the TRO, and therefore required the parties to confer to create a proposed order, despite Defendants' strong opposition to the motion,\" the petition said. \"The District Court issued the TRO by the end of the day.\"\n\nBut in the request the Montana Supreme Court take over the case, the Secretary of State, represented by Knudsen, said Menahan erred numerous ways in issuing that restraining order -- the return to the status quo.\n\n\"The Court's TRO contains a number of serious mistakes of law that improperly interfere with election processes and the statutes governing those processes,\" argued the state.\n\nJacobsen, a Republican, argued the judge improperly found \"inactive\" voters can sign petitions; meddled with statutory deadlines despite no formal request from proponents of the measures; wrongly involved counties when they aren't parties to the lawsuit; and rather than simply halt an action, required specific conduct from the Secretary of State, far outside the bounds of a restraining order.\n\n\"Urgency and emergency factors exist because the statutory deadlines for the review and certification of petition signatures must be followed and are quickly approaching,\" the petition said.\n\nThe post Montana Secretary of State asks state Supreme Court to take over initiative case appeared first on Daily Montanan.\n\nMore from this section\n\nWoman drowns in Yellowstone River near Laurel Sunday\n\nSuspect arrested in Billings after two weapons

But I don't want to do anything that would interfere with the county election administrators who are doing this process or the secretary of state,\" Menahan said during the hearing.\n\nSeveral hours later, Menahan electronically signed the proposed temporary restraining order crafted by attorneys for the state and plaintiffs. The ruling directs the secretary of state to \"restore the state software system to allow the verification of inactive voters' signatures\" over the weekend. Beginning Monday, July 22, the order instructs counties to review and resubmit eligible signatures that were previously blocked from the state system.\n\nhttps://montanafreepress.org/2024/07/16/montana-judge-orders-state-to-accept-inactive-voter-signatures-for-election-and-abortion-ballot-issues/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christi_Jacobsen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christi Jacobsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena,_Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Helena, Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Helena, Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initiative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 49}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9738738", "eventUri": "eng-9738738", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 1492, "textEnd": 1499}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Then, the Missouri Secretary of State's Office has two weeks to certify the ballot measures as sufficient or insufficient. This includes determining whether there were any duplicate pages turned in, or whether any pages were submitted without the required ballot language attached or without an affidavit signed by the circulator.\n\nMissouri is among several states vying to put abortion on the ballot following the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, at which point nearly every abortion became illegal in Missouri. If approved for the ballot, Missourians will decide in November whether to allow abortions up until the point of fetal viability.\n\nMissourians for Constitutional Freedom, the coalition leading the reproductive rights campaigns, turned in 380,000 signatures by their May deadline, including from every county. To qualify for the ballot, campaigns must get signatures from 8% of registered voters in six of Missouri's eight congressional districts, which equates to about 171,000 signatures.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the campaign, which is led by Abortion Action Missouri, the ACLU of Missouri and the state's Planned Parenthood affiliates, had at least a few thousand more verified signatures in each of the six of the eight congressional districts than required.\n\nThe campaign's strongest showing so far was in District 1, which contains the city of St. Louis and part of St. Louis County. There it needs more than 25,600 signatures, and according to data from election officials there were more than 53,000 signatures deemed valid in the district -- despite more than 25,000 signatures being thrown out as invalid.\n\n\"We are confident as we await official certification from the Secretary of State,\" Tori Schafer, deputy director for policy and campaigns with Missouri ACLU, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nAnother initiative petition campaign would raise the state's minimum wage to $13.75 beginning in January 2025 and $15 in 2026, followed by annual cost-of-living increases. It also seeks to set the minimum paid sick leave accumulate at a rate of one hour for every 30 hours worked; paid sick leave would extend to caring for family members.\n\nThe coalition behind the measure, Missourians for Healthy Families and Fair Wages, also turned in signatures from every county as a show of support. So far, they have at least 5,000 additional signatures deemed valid than required in six of the eight congressional districts.\n\n\"We're not surprised to see these preliminary numbers from the Secretary of State because of the momentum on the ground we've felt for months,\" Joni Wickham, communications director, Missourians for Healthy Families and Fair Wages, said in a statement. \" ... We're confident this initiative is headed for success on the November ballot.\"\n\nSignatures turned in by two other measures hoping to make the November ballot -- legalized sports wagering and authorization to build a new casino Near Lake of the Ozarks -- are still early in the process of being totalled by county election officials.\n\nIn May, county officials were directed by the secretary of state's office to verify signatures across the four campaigns in a particular order, with the abortion measure first, followed by minimum wage, sports wagering and finally, the casino, according to an email obtained by The Independent through a request under Missouri's Sunshine Law.\n\nThis means counties are not nearly as far along verifying and totaling signatures for the two latter petitions.\n\nThe sports wagering measure, which is run under a campaign called Winning for Missouri Education, would allow online platforms, major professional sports teams and the state's licensed casinos to seek a sports wagering license. Net winnings would be taxed at 10%, and that revenue, estimated at up to $28.9 million annually, would support education programs.\n\n\"In the coming weeks we look forward to our official certification, which will allow Missourians to invest in our public schools by legalizing sports betting,\" Jack Cardetti, spokesperson for Winning for Missouri Education, said in a statement.\n\nThe final measure, an effort to bring a new casino to the Lake of the Ozarks region, is headed by The Osage River Gaming & Convention committee. If approved for the ballot, and then by voters, it would authorize the development of a hotel, convention center, restaurants and other attractions.\n\nThe proposal would also override a 2008 state law that currently limits Missouri to 13 licensed casinos.\n\n\"We turned in significantly more (signatures) than what was required,\" John Hancock, a spokesperson for the committee, said Wednesday. \"We are confident that we will have enough signatures once verified.\"\n\nThree of the four campaigns appear to have focused the bulk of their efforts on collecting signatures in all but the 6th and 8th districts, which make up northern and southeastern Missouri, respectively.\n\nRecords obtained in May by the Independent indicating how many pages of signatures were turned in per county for each campaign, accompanied by the latest verified signature count, point to a renewed interest in Boone County following lawmakers' decision to split it between the 3rd and 4th districts.\n\nThe minimum wage effort remains the outlier, with signature collectors appearing to favor the 6th district but skipping the 4th, which includes parts of Jackson and Boone counties.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sick_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sick leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referendum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Referendum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Missouri_secretaries_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of Missouri secretaries of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Montana had permitted them to sign petitions until recently, when the Secretary of State had reversed that policy and said they are not eligible to sign.", "source": {"uri": "ballot-access.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ballot Access News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "richard_winger@ballot-access.org", "name": "Richard Winger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Trois-Rivi\u00e8res", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circuit Trois-Rivi\u00e8res"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9738738", "eventUri": "eng-9738738", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-16", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 10}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

The initiatives address standardized testing for graduate high school; auditing the state legislature; unionizing and collective bargaining for transportation network drivers; and providing regulated access to certain psychedelic substances.\n\nOne initiative, which would increase the minimum wage for tipped employees, is pending certification following a challenge to the signatures on the petition filed by Massachusetts Restaurant Association Director of Government Affairs Jessica Muradian with the State Ballot Law Commission. The campaign submitted 12,565 verified signatures. A hearing is scheduled for July 17.\n\nThe process for initiated state statutes in Massachusetts is indirect, which means the legislature has a chance to approve initiatives with successful petitions directly without the measure going to the voters. A first round of signatures equal to 3% of the votes cast for governor (74,574 signatures) is required to put an initiative before the legislature. A second round of signatures equal to 0.5 percent of the votes cast for governor (12,429 signatures) in the last election is required to put the measure on the ballot if the legislature rejects or declines to act on a proposed initiated statute.\n\nSignatures for initiated statutes in Massachusetts are collected in two circulation periods. The first period runs from the third Wednesday in September to two weeks prior to the first Wednesday in December, a period of nine weeks. If the proposed law is not adopted by the first Wednesday of May, petitioners then have until the first Wednesday of July (eight weeks) to request additional petition forms and submit the second round of signatures.\n\nhttps://news.ballotpedia.org/2024/07/16/massachusetts-certifies-four-ballot-questions-on-standardized-testing-state-legislature-audits-transportation-network-drivers-and-psychedelic-substances/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_F._Galvin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William F.

Marie Cornwall, the citizen representative on the committee, quelled multiple outbursts from supporters, and ultimately asked several to leave the room ahead of the committee's vote.\n\nA pair of state troopers stepped to the front of the hearing room to stand between the attendees and the committee after the vote, as several attendees shouted and pointed at the committee members. One man called the panel a \"banana republic\" as he stormed out.\n\nIn denying Lyman's request to obtain the signature packets, the majority of the State Records Committee said turning over the records could harm the integrity of the investigation underway in Washington County.\n\nLinda Petersen, the media representative on the committee, was the lone dissenting vote. She said she believes the public interest in the signature packets \"rises to the level of being equal\" to the concern about the ongoing investigation.\n\nLyman has questioned the signatures Gov. Spencer Cox collected to qualify for the primary election. Cox was projected the winner of the June 25 Republican primary for governor and leads Lyman by 37,525 votes. All county tallies were certified last week, and the statewide canvass is Monday.\n\nThe company Cox used to gather signatures, Gathering Inc., is currently under investigation by the Washington County attorney related to gathering signatures for state Sen. Don Ipson, whose Senate district encompasses about half of the county.\n\nLyman and his running mate, Natalie Clawson, have sued the Utah Lieutenant Governor's Office in an effort to obtain the unredacted signatures, names and addresses of voters who signed candidate petitions for Cox, U.S. Senate candidate Brad Wilson and attorney general candidate Derek Brown. He has also filed a Government Records Access and Management Act request with the lieutenant governor asking for the signature packets from those candidates.\n\nThe campaign is allowed to examine Cox's signature list in person, but cannot make copies or remove the packets from the county clerk's office.\n\nLyman says he seeks to verify the list of voters who signed for Cox, saying he believes there may be issues with Cox's signatures as well. The initial records request for the Ipson signatures was filed by Michael Clara, and the Lyman/Clawson campaign intervened on appeal after the request was denied.\n\nDavis County officials verified the signatures collected by Cox -- because his running mate, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson oversees the state's elections office -- and Lyman's campaign has argued that the governor may not have qualified for the ballot if signees of Ipson's signature packets who are being questioned also signed to put Cox on the ballot.\n\nEric Clarke, the Washington County attorney, told the State Records Committee the number of signatures in question in the Ipson investigation is between 30 and 60. Cox's campaign met the threshold of at least 28,000 verified signatures ahead of the GOP convention in April, and a campaign consultant told KSL.com on Thursday that the campaign submitted about 33,000 before the deadline.\n\nClarke argued to the committee that turning over the list of Ipson's signatures would potentially harm the ongoing investigation.\n\nHe also said there is not an urgent need for the signature list to be turned over because Ipson advanced out of the state convention in April, making the validity of his signatures moot as it concerns his legitimacy on the ballot.\n\n\"What we're asking for is, give us some time to do an investigation,\" he said.\n\nThe hearing was only focused on the request to obtain the signatures related to Ipson's campaign, not the signatures collected statewide on behalf of Cox.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

For any candidate, if it is found that he/she has been the beneficiary of any malpractice, the candidature of such person would be cancelled at any stage during the counselling process or even afterwards, it says.\n\nThe National Testing Agency submitted its affidavit to the Supreme Court just a day before it is scheduled to hear 43 petitions from across the country related to the NEET UG paper leak case.\n\nThe Supreme Court, noting that the integrity of NEET-UG 2024 has been \"compromised,\" indicated on Monday that a re-test might be ordered if the entire process is found to be impacted. The court had earlier requested detailed information from the National Testing Agency and the CBI, including the timing and method of the leak, as well as the number of individuals involved, to assess the extent of the breach.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Eligibility_cum_Entrance_Test_(Undergraduate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Madras", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IIT Madras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Testing_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Testing Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Science_in_Society/Forensic_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Science in Society/Forensic Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Pelvic_Exams_and_Pap_Tests", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Pelvic Exams and Pap Tests", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/07/11/article/image/20240708165L-1720637446107.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722511", "eventUri": "eng-9722511", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-05-05", "textStart": 484, "textEnd": 489}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

NTA also told the court that it would be relying on the findings of the IIT Madras report during the proceedings on Thursday.\n\nAlso Read | NEET petitioners allege lack of transparency, systematic fraud\n\nThe agency claimed that the video showing a photo of the NEET-UG exam paper leaked on Telegram on May 4 was fake. \"Discussions within the Telegram channel indicate that members identified the video as fake.

Comments and discussions on social media further corroborate that the images in the video were edited, and the date was intentionally modified to suggest a May 4 leak. The screenshots highlight the fabricated nature of the claims made in the video\", the affidavit stated.\n\nAccording to the Centre's affidavit, the department of higher education, ministry of education, had requested IIT-Madras to conduct a detailed data analysis of the NEET-UG 2024 results to identify any suspected cases of malpractice and evaluating the spread of top-performing candidates.\n\nIIT-Madras conducted a thorough analysis of the top 140,000 ranks for 2023 and 2024 to detect any abnormalities. This analysis, the Centre said, aimed to identify if any centres or cities showed signs of undue advantage to a large number of students due to malpractices.\n\nThe report of the analysis, dated July 10, however, revealed no indications of mass malpractice or any localised set of candidates benefitting unduly, adding the distribution of high marks was consistent across various cities and centres, the government said.\n\nAlso Read | NEET-UG paper leak: CBI arrests two persons, including a candidate, from Bihar\n\n\"The analysis shows that there is neither any indication of mass malpractice nor a localized set of candidates being benefitted leading to abnormal scores. There is an overall increase in the marks obtained by students, specifically in the range of 550 to 720 (total score). This increase is seen across the cities and centres. This is attributed to 25% reduction in syllabus. In addition, candidates obtaining such high marks are spread across multiple cities and multiple centres, indicating very less likelihood of malpractice,\" stated the affidavit.\n\nThe IIT-Madras report, endorsed by its director, maintained that the analysis of the 2023 and 2024 NEET-UG data could lead to an inference \"with confidence that there has been no abnormality, which has affected the results\".\n\nThe affidavit has been submitted in compliance with the directive of a bench, led by Chief Justice of India Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, which on Monday highlighted the compromised sanctity of the NEET-UG 2024 due to a question paper leak but emphasised that the issue of retest would depend on whether the wrongdoers can be effectively segregated in order to prevent the wastage of resources, disruption of the academic calendar and potential damage to the career prospects of millions of honest students.\n\nAlso Read | NEET-UG likely to be held in online mode\n\nFixing the next hearing on Thursday, the court outlined settled parameters for deciding whether a retest is necessary, which included ascertaining if the breach occurred at a systemic level; if the breach affected the overall integrity of the examination process; and the possibility of identifying and segregating the beneficiaries of the fraud from the untainted students. The bench sought details about the nature and extent of the leak, the gap between the leak and the conduct of the exam, the manner of the leak, dissemination of the leaked question papers, steps taken to identify the beneficiaries, and measures adopted to secure the integrity of future examinations.\n\nThe Centre's affidavit outlined the steps taken by the Union government to ensure the examination's integrity and address any malpractices. Pointing out that the ministry of health & family welfare oversees the counselling process for UG seats, which will begin in the third week of July 2024, the affidavit stated that any candidate found guilty of malpractice will have their candidature cancelled during or after the counselling process.\n\nNTA, on its part, submitted that the options being considered is to replace the mode of conduct of examination from pen and paper mode (OMR based) to computer-based test (CBT) mode.\n\n\"Further options are also being explored simultaneously so as to perfectly obviate the occurrence of any malpractices that may affect the sanctity and integrity of the exam,\" it said, adding that based on the progress of investigations, as and when the names of suspicious candidates become available, it can also initiate administrative process for debarring such candidates.\n\nIt also pointed that not 67 but only 61 candidates had scored the perfect marks of 720 because six of them were given grace marks due to a loss of time and after the retest, those si candidates have not been able to score 720.\n\nTo strengthen the examination process, the government said, it has established a high-level committee of experts, headed by Dr K. Radhakrishnan, former chairman of ISRO, and chairman, board of governors, IIT Kanpur. This committee will recommend measures to enhance transparency and robustness in future examinations.\n\nThe affidavit underscored the government's legislative efforts to ensure examination integrity. The Parliament enacted the Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, which came into effect on June 21, 2024. This Act provides stringent punishments for offences related to unfair means in public examinations, ensuring a robust legal framework to deter malpractices, said the Centre.\n\n\"The Union of India is not taking the present litigation in an adversarial manner and is duty-bound to address the concerns of the students who have taken the NEET examination 2024,\" the affidavit said.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Madras", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IIT Madras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Eligibility_cum_Entrance_Test_(Undergraduate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Testing_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Testing Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malpractice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Malpractice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram_(messaging_service)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Telegram (messaging service)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godhra", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Godhra"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Godhra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patna", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Patna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_segregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racial segregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bihar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bihar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Kanpur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IIT Kanpur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Radhakrishnan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "K.

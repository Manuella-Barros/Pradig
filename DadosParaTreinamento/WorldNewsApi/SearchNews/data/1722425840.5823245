{"id": 243225464, "title": "Prince's 'Purple Rain' turns 40 \u2014 and we celebrate with the ultimate soundtrack playlist", "text": "It\u2019s not an understatement when I tell you that Prince\u2019s \u201cPurple Rain\u201d soundtrack changed my life after it came out 40 years ago on June 25, 1984. I wore that vinyl out after I scraped my coins together and bought it \u2014 and probably had to sneak it into the house. Before you even got to the music, Prince, in all his purple glory on his purple motorcycle, looked like the flyest, funkiest man I had ever seen. But then there was the music, which was nothing short of revolutionary \u2014 from \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy\u201d to \u201cWhen Doves Cry\u201d to, of course, the epic title track, \u201cPurple Rain.\u201d And that was all a month before the release of the hit movie, which will be back in select theaters on July 3. It\u2019s not only my favorite soundtrack of all time, but one of my top-five albums of all time. Period. And in honor of Purple Rain\u2019s 40th anniversary, let\u2019s throw it back to some of my other all-time favorite soundtracks: \u2018Saturday Night Fever\u2019 Let\u2019s kick it off with the smash \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d soundtrack, which had everybody twirling under that disco ball back in 1977. John Travolta may have been the star of the movie, but the Bees Gees were the stars of the soundtrack. Whenever \u201cStayin\u2019 Alive\u201d comes on \u2014 trust \u2014 disco is no longer dead. And it still makes you wanna bust into your best Tony Manero strut. \u2018Waiting to Exhale\u2019 Just like the Bee Gees were the masterminds behind the \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d soundtrack, Babyface was the man behind all the female feels on the 1995 \u201cWaiting to Exhale\u201d soundtrack \u2026 Face wrote and produced for a stellar cast of soul sisters \u2026 from Aretha Franklin and Mary J. Blige to Chaka Khan and Patti LaBelle to Toni Braxton and Brandy. I mean, it was a who\u2019s who! And of course, there was Whitney Houston, who also starred in the film. And I\u2019m going to just say it \u2026 this beats \u201cThe Bodyguard\u201d soundtrack for me. Fight me on that one! \u2018Claudine\u2019 Next up is another soulful soundtrack, to the 1974 movie \u201cClaudine\u201d starring the legendary Diahann Carroll \u2014 who was actually nominated for a Best Actress Oscar, so check it out if you haven\u2019t seen it. But the soundtrack belonged to another black queen, Gladys Knight and, of course, the Pips. The main man, though, was Curtis Mayfield, who had already produced the classic \u201cSuper Fly\u201d soundtrack in 1972. But I\u2019m Team Claudine! \u2018Brokeback Mountain\u2019 Gonna switch it up with the \u201cBrokeback Mountain\u201d soundtrack, which captured the heart of the gay cowboy romance in 2006. It had all the rootsy realness with Willie Nelson and Emmylou Harris, plus an Oscar-winning score by Gustavo Santaolalla that you need to tip your cowboy hat toward. \u201cBlack Panther\u2019 And rounding out my playlist is the 2018 \u201cBlack Panther\u201d soundtrack. I just have two words for you on this one: Kendrick Lamar. He did the damn thing curating this soundtrack and rocking the mic on tracks like his SZA joint \u201cAll the Stars.\u201d And he did it all while also taking us back to the motherland \u2014 Africa.", "summary": "In honor of the 40th anniversary of the legendary \"Purple Rain\" soundtrack this week, let\u2019s throw it back to some of my other all-time favorite soundtracks \u2014 from \"Saturday Night Fever\" to \"Black Panther.\"", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/28/entertainment/princes-purple-rain-turns-40-and-we-celebrate-with-the-ultimate-soundtrack-playlist/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/84637150.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ElUNKhg3-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:40:52", "author": "Chuck Arnold", "authors": ["Chuck Arnold"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.159}

And now, almost 97, she is still intelligent, funny, gentle and charming. Today I have a wonderful relationship with her, but for many years it was so bad that I used to wonder whether we would ever speak to one another again. When I was a child, I didn't (unlike some little girls) want to be her, but I loved her so intensely I would have died to protect her. She was a kind of real-life Cinderella who had lost her own mother aged just two. I never would have guessed that our own love as daughter and mother would later go wrong due to a very unlikely protagonist \u2014 my mother's beloved cat, Marina. Before this, though, my mother truly was a kind of heroine in my eyes. Born in South Africa, she obtained a first class degree in history of art at Wits University in Johannesburg and became a journalist. She met my British father, Dennis, also a journalist, while they were both working on the country's premier newspaper, The Star. They were both quite well known, and eloped to Venice to get married in 1958. I was born in Johannesburg a year later. But unable to stand apartheid, they left South Africa, first for London when I was three (where my sister Constance was born), and then to Italy, where my dad worked for a branch of the UN in Rome. My mother taught me to read before I went to primary school. She knew dozens of folk songs, which we would all sing on car journeys. When we first moved to London, she built us a playhouse in our tiny garden in Camden Town (complete with a hidden trap-door), and loved flowers, dressing-up and fun. I had an idyllic childhood, which became even better once my father got his job in Rome. I was six at the time and felt very lucky to live in Italy. The beauty of its art and architecture, its landscape, the kindness of its people and the weird but wonderful life of expatriates made it seem as if I was living in a Renaissance paradise. While my contemporaries in Britain discovered the 1960s, I was living the child's version of la dolce vita \u2014 swimming, learning Italian, eating delicious ice cream, talking to my parents' interesting friends and even going to the opera. The only thing I missed about London was watching TV. Things, though, went downhill. In London I had always been ill with coughs and colds, and for a while my health improved thanks to the warmer Italian weather. Then it became worse. Night after night I would struggle to breathe, even with temporary relief from the recently invented Ventolin inhaler for asthma. Our GP recommended I be tested at an allergy clinic. My arm was pricked with different allergens. One turned into a huge, red, itchy lump. I had acute allergic asthma. And what was making me ill was our cat, Marina, brought over from London and which my mother adored. Aged 12, I was sent back to England to boarding school. 'It was me or the cat, and she chose the cat,' I would joke later. But it was not a joke. As well as the role played by Marina, my parents believed I would have a better education in England. My father had our school fees paid by his overseas employers, and he was delighted to know I could go to a public school for 'free'. I went to Bedales, a co-ed boarding school in Hampshire, which was full of the children of famous, arty people. As someone who loved music, acting and art, they thought I'd fit right in there. Within a week of arriving I had stopped wheezing \u2013 but I was also unutterably miserable. People are far more aware these days of what bad places public schools can be, and for me it was a combination of Mean Girls and Lord Of The Flies, in which the shy, the studious and the virginal found it very hard to flourish. Had I told my parents quite how bad it was, they would have brought me home at once. But I also knew that my mother would keep the cat, and I did not want further exposure to it. In the 1960s there was much less understanding about how lethal asthma can be. Doctors had all kinds of theories about the disease, including that it was purely psychological, and some believed children could grow out of it. It is, however, completely physical, and the sensation of gasping for air is terrifying. Even now, when my asthma is better controlled by steroids, I am periodically taken off to A&E by paramedics to be put on to a nebuliser. So I felt trapped between home and school, and very angry that, when I visited my parents three times a year in the school holidays, I couldn't come back to a cat-free home. My family and I began to quarrel. These were not the usual adolescent rows, though we had those too. I was a 'good' girl \u2014 I didn't smoke, drink, take drugs or have boyfriends \u2014 but there was no subject, from politics to pocket money, that was free from friction. I was appalling to live with, and so, hurt and confused, were they. As so often, my escape came by reading and writing stories. I worked hard, getting into Cambridge University to read English literature. I had always known that I was a writer, and while I earned a living as a young journalist I wrote my debut novel, Foreign Bodies. It was published by the time I was 30. It was the first of my novels to be set in Italy, in an imaginary hill-town which is partly based on Cortona, in Tuscany, where my parents had bought a cottage. While its heroine, Emma, is not me, I poured my love of Tuscany into a plot about a rebellious girl who runs away from home in London to discover art and love. As time went on my career improved, and so did family relations. I married the loveliest man in the world and we had two delightful children. My husband and I made efforts every summer to visit my parents in Tuscany, where they had retired. Beautiful though this was, it was always fraught with anxiety, because within half an hour of setting foot in their home I was wheezing and streaming again. We rented a nearby cottage at huge expense, in order to be safe. Although Marina had died of old age, she had been replaced by two rescue kittens, Cleo and Tiny. I gave my allergy to one of my characters in The Lie Of The Land. It's a black comedy about moving to the countryside, and at the climax my hero Xan is locked in a room with a cat by a psychopath. Death by allergic asthma is a novel method of murder, but I also hoped that it would help my mother understand what it felt like. I'll never know \u2013 perhaps wisely, she never comments on my books. Gradually, however, I began to realise what a deep wound losing her own mother at such a young age had caused. When her mother died from a poisonous spider bite, Zelda and her brother were passed between two very different sets of relations: her mother's intellectual Jewish family who had sat shiva (the week-long formal period of mourning, normally reserved for when relatives died) when she had 'married out'; and her father's English and Dutch family. Though well-intentioned, neither were sympathetic. And so my mother had no template for being a parent. Many unhappy children find consolation in pets, and my mother's intense love of cats probably stems from her bereavement. It was only in her 20s, before I was born, when she got her first cat \u2014 a Siamese called Sabrina \u2014 and was allowed to love that pet of her own, that she was enabled to feel happy. Now I'm a mother too, I can see how difficult and painful our relationship was for her as well as myself. In many ways, however, this was a gift: my mother is the person who, above all, made me so interested in human relations and choices that I became a novelist. Then my dear father died suddenly in 2008, and my mother became ill with cancer. My heroic sister Constance \u2014 who is not allergic to cats \u2014 would fly out from London every six weeks to Cortona to nurse her, or just cheer her up. I rang every day, and could now leave my teenaged children and fly out to stay with her in warmer weather. But I mostly had to sit in the garden, to avoid the cats. I loved walking slowly with her to eat out at one of the many excellent local trattorie, listening to her circle of elderly friends. Each time I left her, I feared it would be the last. It was staying with my mother in these years that inspired my latest novel, The Three Graces, and its cast of expatriate retirees living in the same imaginary Tuscan hill-town as that of my first novel. I found older people fascinating. Since publishing it, I met a woman of 92 who confided to me that she was having the best sex of her life (my jaw dropped). Many of those I met looked not a day over 60, were still driving, doing Pilates and tennis. Most were, like my mother, distinctly stylish. Yet when older people appeared in fiction or films it was usually as people with dementia, whose entire personality was just to be old. So my three octogenarian heroines, Ruth, Marta and Diana, were born. The book attracted an auction last summer between three top film producers, and is now being developed as a TV series. But even as I was writing The Three Graces, things began to go downhill for my mother. She had become too ill to remain on her own in Italy. Once again my sister came to the rescue, and told her that after 50 years in Italy she had to return to England. Despite being in agony, Zelda refused point-blank to leave until her cat, Cleo, had first been transported by special courier to London. This odyssey took two days because Cleo had to be driven carefully, with food and rest suitable for an elderly moggy, and cost several hundred pounds. She was not pleased to arrive in London, to a strange house. Meanwhile, Constance organised for our mother to be airlifted out by private plane \u2013 something that happens at the end to one of my Three Graces, though in my novel it's a dog that one of my heroines won't leave without. Miraculously, a London hospital cured my mother of what turned out to be nerve pain. Just over three years away from her 100th birthday, she lives in the attic of my sister and brother-in-law's house on the other side of London to me. They look after her brilliantly. She still walks up and down 30 steps to her room every day, reads several books a week, and on good days manages to see one or two new friends. We all have a closeness that, even ten years ago, I would never have thought possible. Having tea with her once a week is a treat, and we never stop talking and laughing together. She gives me gentle advice, and I know she is one of the great loves of my life. How I wish we had got to this stage sooner, and how glad I am that it came, nonetheless! Of course she misses her independence in Italy, but now my adult children have got to know and enjoy her, and vice versa. 'She's absolutely amazing,' each says after a visit. Then, if they are feeling mischievous, they add, 'You know, Mum, I think that I might like to have a cat\u2026", "summary": "My mother Zelda is beautiful.

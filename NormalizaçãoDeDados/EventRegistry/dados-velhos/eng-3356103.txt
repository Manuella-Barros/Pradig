Take a look back a some of Bambi's hottest looks right here!\n\n\"...Meaning I ain't handle certain things right,\" he continues in his caption. \"Even tho sometimes u got on my nerves and my neck wit yo crazy a** I'm a man and should of handle it better.

These are some pretty intimate words to be broadcasting to the world!\n\nLast we checked, Scrappy was rumored to be getting back with his baby mama Erica Dixon, 32. The pair were spotted grabbing food together while on vacation in Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic in July! But does this #TBT post mean Scrappy's trying to romance Bambi again? And, more importantly, will this message mends things between him and Bambi after to much turmoil? Only time will tell!\n\nHollywoodLifers, should Bambi give Scrappy another shot or no?

In July, Bambi put her LHHATL love interest on blast by posting several private text messages he sent her on Instagram.\n\nThe texts -- which occurred between June and July -- show Scrappy desperately begging for forgiveness and asking Bambi to speak to him. Bambi told him she moved on and then began ignoring him. But after growing tired of him blowing up her phone, she exposed him on social media.\n\nBambi hasn't responded to Scrappy's latest effort to win her back, so far. However, her latest post on the Gram suggests she's not interested. \"Don't bae me ... #PayMe,\" she writes.", "time": "20:21:00"}

The two reportedly called it quits in May 2017, and Bambi's mom even helped move all of his belongings out of her house after they parted ways.\n\nScrappy is seemingly having regrets about ending their romance, even though some speculated he was getting back with Erica Dixon. Alongside a throwback pic of him with Bambi, he wrote, \"My #TBT is this woman I really love and miss u in my life. I ain't gone lie sh*t got real crazy and a mf dipped when it got too heavy.\" Scrappy adeded, \"Even tho sometimes u got on my nerves and my neck wit yo crazy a** I'm a man and should of handle it better.

The rapper took to IG on Aug. 12 in yet another attempt to win his ex back and asked fans to help him 'find the Bam.'\n\nLove & Hip-Hop star Lil Scrappy, 33, is taking his quest to get his ex-fiancee Bambi Benson, 31, back to the streets! The Atlanta-based rapper hopped on Instagram yesterday, Aug. 12, to beg fans to help him find Bambi in hopes that she will take him back after his wandering eye got the better of him during their engagement and she kicked him to the curb! Scrappy named his new mission \"Operation Find the Bam.\" And it is adorable, hilarious and sad all at the same time. Click here to see pics of Scrappy and Bambi.\n\n\"So I'm going on a hunt right now, tryin' find the Bam,\" Scrappy says to the camera while sitting at an outdoor cafe and puffing on a cigar. He then proceeds to ask passersby if they've \"seen the Bam\" and where he can find her. A few of them even recognized him and laughed about the fact he was \"still looking for her.\" He continued to ask fans on the street in a second post, but his attempt to find his love was unsuccessful. But does that mean his video will amount to nothing? It's possible she will see it -- though he has already made several public attempts to get her attention.\n\nOn Aug. 10, Scrappy shared a heartfelt message that was clearly intended to help win back the Bam! \"My #TBT is this woman I really love and miss u in my life,\" the rapper captioned an adorable shot of himself and his former fiancee. \"I ain't gone lie sh*t got real crazy and a mf dipped when it got too heavy.\" Scrappy seems to have been working to get his girl back ever since she threw him out for good in May 2017, but so far she hasn't had any of his public (or alleged private) apologies. Could it be that this video will do the trick?\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think of Scrappy's video message to Bambi? Will it be enough to win her back? Let us know below!", "time": "17:27:00"}

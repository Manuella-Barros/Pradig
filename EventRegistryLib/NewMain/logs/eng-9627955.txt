Pep Guardiola is a huge fan of the Brazil midfielder and publicly praised him earlier this season. Guimaraes would be a smart alternative to West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta.\n\nManchester City remain keen admirers of Newcastle United's \u00a3100m-rated midfielder Bruno Guimaraes, transfer expert Dean Jones has revealed to GIVEMESPORT. The Premier League champions could spend around \u00a3200m this summer, meaning half of their transfer budget could be dedicated to a swoop for the Brazilian.\n\nAlthough on the cusp of battling 115 financial fair play charges, City are still looking prepared to break the bank this summer and come good on Guardiola's praise for Guimaraes before the FA Cup quarter-final clash back in March.\n\nNewcastle will be wary that there is a \u00a3100 million release clause in the South American's contract active until the end of June.\n\nPep Guardiola's praise for Magpie star 'Exceptional' and 'complete' holding midfielder\n\nAhead of their FA Cup quarter-final meeting, in which Man City prevailed 2-0 thanks to a double from Bernardo Silva, Guardiola emphatically outlined Guimaraes in his pre-match thoughts. Describing the 26-year-old in superlative terms for his position, the City boss said:\n\n\"He is an exceptional holding midfielder. He is aggressive, with the ball or without the ball. At set pieces, he's aggressive and is a real, complete holding midfielder since being at Lyon and now at a club who want to grow up and up. I'm sure he's part of the project for the next years. Definitely.\"\n\nWith the former Athletico Paranaense man's form, Newcastle and Eddie Howe would agree. Guimaraes finished the season with seven goals and eight assists to his name in the Premier League.\n\nAlso sitting in the top percentiles for both touches (top 13%) and chances created (26%) when compared to other midfielders in the league, it's obvious that much of Newcastle's attack flows through the imperious midfielder.\n\nWhile those at St James' Park might fear losing one of their key stars, Guimaraes did previously down-play the situation. He responded to Guardiola's kind words:\n\n\"Sometimes the people speak a lot about me, I just think about football. I'm happy here, in this club doing my best. I love the way the fans like me, so I focus on my football and let the people speak. (...) I never felt so much love for the fans like here. They've been unbelievable for me and my family so I try to play for fans. So I hope I can keep going here for as long as possible.\"\n\nA worthy alternative to Paqueta Guimaraes is a better fit than West Ham midfielder\n\nLast summer, Manchester City were strongly linked with West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta, with some reports claiming he'd even agreed to a six-year contract at the Ethiad. But the deal fell apart after it became apparent that the playmaker was under investigation for match fixing. The Brazil international was charged with four instances of alleged spot-fixing in May after the conclusion of the 2023-24 Premier League season, seemingly ending any scope of City coming back in for him.\n\nBut the Premier League champions may well have found a more suitable candidate in Guimaraes anyway. Whereas Paqueta is more of an offensive midfielder, or can even be deployed on the wing, Guimaraes is an out-and-out central midfielder - and he actually has the more well-rounded stats compared to his troubled international teammate.\n\nBruno Guimaraes vs Lucas Paqueta Premier League stats comparison 2023-24\n\nStatistic\n\nBruno Guimaraes\n\nLucas Paqueta\n\nMatches Played\n\n37\n\n31\n\nGoals\n\n7\n\n4\n\nAssists\n\n8\n\n6\n\nExpected Goal (xG)\n\n4.8\n\n5.4\n\nNon-penalty goals expected (npxG)\n\n4.8\n\n3.8\n\nExpected Assisted Goals (xAG)\n\n6.4\n\n5.4\n\nShot-Creating Actions (SCA)\n\n143\n\n95\n\nGoal-Creating Actions (GCA)\n\n19\n\n16\n\nFinal table position\n\n7th\n\n9th\n\nAll statistics courtesy of FBRef", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guimar\u00e3es", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guimar\u00e3es"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guimar\u00e3es"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Athletico_Paranaense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Club Athletico Paranaense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernardo Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Howe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Howe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympique_Lyonnais", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympique Lyonnais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James'_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St James' Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_fixing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Match fixing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/every-premier-league-club_s-net-spend-since-pep-guardiola-joined-man-city_720.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627955", "eventUri": "eng-9627955", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Paqueta, as HITC revealed, was City's top summer transfer target - but they have stepped back from him.\n\nThese two factors are cause for concern with HITC understanding that Manchester City, who were interested in the 26-year-old previously, are now stepping up their efforts to sign the Brazilian.\n\nCity want to improve their midfield options and they have been left disappointed at the impact made by former Wolves midfielder Matheus Nunes from Wolves and, along with Kalvin Phillips, will be allowed to leave this summer.\n\nHITC understands that Guimaraes is currently weighing up his options but a move to a top-level European or English side is something that he feels he has to consider.\n\nArsenal are said to be admirers of the Brazilian midfielder but HITC understands that the Gunners have little appetite to pay his release clause but the same cannot be said of European giants Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nPSG are long-term admirers of the former Lyon midfielder and they have been interested in Guimaraes for a while and HITC understands that there is a chance the French giants will make a move.", "source": {"uri": "hitc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HITC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shaun_webbley@hitc.com", "name": "Shaun Webbley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guimar\u00e3es", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guimar\u00e3es"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Guimar\u00e3es"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Isak", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Isak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James'_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St James' Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matheus_Nunes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matheus Nunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympique_Lyonnais", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympique Lyonnais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.hitc.com/static/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2089284469-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9627955", "eventUri": "eng-9627955", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Gloucestershire Coroner's Court heard a friend had gone to Ms Catchpole's home and found a handwritten note on A4 paper attached to the front door saying, \"Don't come in, call the police\".\n\nThe friend had gone to the adjacent property where the musician lived and Mr Morrison had used keys to access the property and found his former partner's body.

In a written statement, GP Dr Emma Basker said Ms Catchpole had also suffered from \"reoccurring mental ill-health\", including anxiety and PTSD, and had received medication, counselling and psychological therapy.\n\nGloucestershire area coroner Roland Wooderson recorded a conclusion of suicide. \"It is quite clear to me that, sadly, at the relevant time Gill was in a difficult place mentally,\" the coroner said. \"It is entirely clear to me that the contents of those notes indicate that Gill unfortunately was in a very difficult place at the time of her death.\n\n\"Having reviewed the evidence I have, it seems to me sadly that the appropriate conclusion on the balance of probabilities I will record a conclusion of suicide.\" Friends and family members of Ms Catchpole, including her mother, father and step-father, who attended the hearing did not comment as they left.\n\nA post mortem into Gill's death on 9th January gave a provisional cause of death for the mum-of-two as ligature suspension, with a corner ruling that Gill had died by suicide.\n\nThe inquest into Gill's death heard that the mum-of-two was discovered by her husband James at their family home on a Friday, after a concerned friend who had struggled to gain access inside the property contacted the Brit Award winning singer. Broken Strings hitmaker James - who cancelled all work commitments following his wife's death - had a key to the house and was the one to discover his wife's body on entering their home.\n\nJames is still yet to publicly speak out regarding his wife's untimely death. In January, it was reported that James had been left \"devastated\" by her passing but was trying to remain strong for the two children they shared together, daughters Elsie, 15, and Ada, five.\n\nJust before she died inside her family home, Gill appeared to be looking for a new place to live. She posted on Facebook : \"Looking for a house to rent in Whitminster ASAP. Please contact me if anyone knows or hears of anything. TIA.\" A family friend said of Gill's death: \"Gill was found dead on Friday at the family's home in Whitminster. James is devastated and is being supported by his family. He is holding it together for their girls but has asked for the family to be left alone to grieve in private.\"\n\nJames often spoke about his relationship with Gill over the years and previously talked about how becoming a dad changed him, especially since his own father had just passed away before the birth of his first child. \"Just before he died my first daughter, Elsie, was born. So in a way her birth helped me think more about life,\" the I Won't Let You Go singer told OK! magazine.\n\n\"I then tried to focus on my music in a bid to pull me out of it. I began to write new songs, most of them were quite personal, which talked about my dad - so that was cathartic. Becoming a father changed the way I looked at life. Because I knew I needed to be there for my daughter. That helped me out of the dark times.\"\n\nIn an interview with the White Wine Question Time podcast, James recalled the unique way his romance with Gill began, revealing: \"It wasn't the easiest start, but I just still see it as a really romantic thing. I'm not very romantic. I'm not like: 'I love romance!' But I do find certain things romantic and the fact that we met each other the way we did. It's like a little fairy tale or something!\"\n\nHe met Gill thanks to the late mum-of-two lodging at his mum's house - with her then-partner. James recalled: \"We just had a connection straight away really. But I had to wait two years to find out if what I thought I felt was real. Because I wasn't going out with her for the first year or so she lived there. She was with her boyfriend, so I was getting to know her. And I didn't want to tell her that I fell in love with her the first moment I set eyes on her because I didn't know, I never fell in love before. So I didn't really know if it was that. So it was like a massive moment for me to even tell her that I liked her.\"\n\nAfter Gill split from her boyfriend who also lived at James' mum's house as a lodger, they started their romantic journey three months later. Despite this, Gill's ex managed to re-enter James' life by starting a relationship with his mum. Recounting the surprising moment, James shared: \"He got me back. My mum rang me one day. And she said: 'I'm out on a date. I wonder if you can pick me up?'\n\n\"I said: 'Where are you?' And she said: 'I'm at John's house.' And I was like: 'John's house? Who's John? 'She said: 'You know, Gill's John'. Okay, so I have to go and pick my mum up from my girlfriend's ex's house, and it was the most awkward thing! But I didn't like the fact that she said that. So I was like: 'No it's not a date. They're just hanging out.' Yeah, it was awkward!\"\n\n*If you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

Gloucestershire Coroner's Court heard a friend had gone to Gill's home and found a handwritten note on A4 paper attached to the front door saying, \"Don't come in, call the police\".\n\nREAD MORE: Meath mum died after severe reaction to common drug used to treat skin conditions\n\nREAD MORE: Mum finds partner dead on same day she gives birth to their baby daughter\n\nThe concerned friend had gone to the adjacent property where the musician lived and the Brit Award-winning singer had used keys to access the property and found his former partner's body. Police and paramedics were called out, and Gill was pronounced dead at 9.37am.\n\nDetective Sergeant David Kania, who investigated the sudden death, ruled out any third-party involvement. \"A friend of the deceased had attended when they saw a sheet of A4 sheet of paper with the words written, 'Don't come in, call the police',\" the officer said in a statement.\n\n\"The friend went to the house and raised the ex-partner, who located a set of keys to the annexe house where upon they entered and found the deceased.

It has been relayed to me that close friends and family had indicated that Gill had been suffering with her mental health for the last year or so and since the split from her ex-partner.

The legal drink drive limit is 80mg per 100ml of blood. The inquest heard the toxicologist was unable to determine \"whether or not or the degree\" to which the use of alcohol had impacted upon Gill's state of mind at the time of her death.\n\nThe court was told Gill had suffered from kidney disease since 2008 and later underwent a kidney transplant. In a written statement, GP Dr Emma Basker said Gill had also suffered from \"reoccurring mental ill-health\", including anxiety and PTSD, and had received medication, counselling and psychological therapy.\n\nGloucestershire area coroner Roland Wooderson recorded a conclusion of suicide. \"It is quite clear to me that, sadly, at the relevant time Gill was in a difficult place mentally,\" the coroner said. \"It is entirely clear to me that the contents of those notes indicate that Gill unfortunately was in a very difficult place at the time of her death.\n\n\"Having reviewed the evidence I have, it seems to me sadly that the appropriate conclusion on the balance of probabilities I will record a conclusion of suicide.\" Friends and family members of Gill, including her mother, father and step-father, who attended the hearing did not comment as they left. James was not present at the hearing on Thursday.\n\nThe inquest into Gill's death heard that the mum-of-two was discovered by her husband James at their family home on a Friday, after a concerned friend who had struggled to gain access inside the property contacted the Brit Award winning singer.\n\nBroken Strings hitmaker James - who cancelled all work commitments following his wife's death - had a key to the house and was the one to discover his wife's body on entering their home. James is still yet to publicly speak out regarding his wife's untimely death. In January, it was reported that James had been left \"devastated\" by her passing but was trying to remain strong for the two children they shared together, daughters Elsie, 15, and Ada, five.\n\nJust before she died inside her family home, Gill appeared to be looking for a new place to live. She posted on Facebook : \"Looking for a house to rent in Whitminster ASAP. Please contact me if anyone knows or hears of anything. TIA.\" A family friend said of Gill's death: \"Gill was found dead on Friday at the family's home in Whitminster. James is devastated and is being supported by his family. He is holding it together for their girls but has asked for the family to be left alone to grieve in private.\"\n\nJames often spoke about his relationship with Gill over the years and previously talked about how becoming a dad changed him, especially since his own father had just passed away before the birth of his first child. \"Just before he died my first daughter, Elsie, was born. So in a way her birth helped me think more about life,\" the I Won't Let You Go singer told OK! magazine.\n\n\"I then tried to focus on my music in a bid to pull me out of it. I began to write new songs, most of them were quite personal, which talked about my dad - so that was cathartic. Becoming a father changed the way I looked at life. Because I knew I needed to be there for my daughter. That helped me out of the dark times.\"\n\nIn an interview with the White Wine Question Time podcast, James recalled the unique way his romance with Gill began, revealing: \"It wasn't the easiest start, but I just still see it as a really romantic thing. I'm not very romantic. I'm not like: 'I love romance!' But I do find certain things romantic and the fact that we met each other the way we did. It's like a little fairy tale or something!\"\n\nHe met Gill thanks to the late mum-of-two lodging at his mum's house - with her then-partner. James recalled: \"We just had a connection straight away really. But I had to wait two years to find out if what I thought I felt was real. Because I wasn't going out with her for the first year or so she lived there. She was with her boyfriend, so I was getting to know her.

More info\n\nAn inquest into the tragic death of James Morrison's estranged wife was held at Gloucestershire Coroner's Court on Thursday, nearly half a year after her untimely passing.\n\nThe 'You Give Me Something' singer, aged 39, tragically lost his wife Gill Catchpole, 45, earlier this year when he discovered the mother of his two children lifeless inside their family home in Gloucestershire on Friday, 5th January.\n\nJames was left heartbroken at the beginning of the year after finding his former partner deceased, following a worried friend noticing a note on the front door in the aftermath of their split, an inquest heard on Thursday.\n\nGill, aged 45, was discovered dead by James at her residence in Whitminster, Gloucestershire, on 5th January. The inquest at Gloucestershire Coroner's Court heard a friend had visited Gill's home and found a handwritten note on A4 paper attached to the front door reading, \"Don't come in, call the police\".\n\nThe worried friend had gone to the neighbouring property where the musician resided and the Brit Award-winning singer used keys to enter the property and found his ex-partner's body. Emergency services were alerted, and Gill was pronounced dead at 9.37am, reports the Mirror.\n\nDetective Sergeant David Kania, who investigated the sudden death, ruled out any involvement from a third party. \"A friend of the deceased had attended when they saw a sheet of A4 paper with the words written, 'Don't come in, call the police',\" the officer stated.\n\n\"The friend went to the house and raised the ex-partner, who located a set of keys to the annexe house where upon they entered and found the deceased.

In a written statement, GP Dr Emma Basker said Gill had also suffered from \"reoccurring mental ill-health\", including anxiety and PTSD, and had received medication, counselling and psychological therapy.\n\nGloucestershire's area coroner, Roland Wooderson, delivered a verdict of suicide, remarking, \"It is quite clear to me that, sadly, at the relevant time Gill was in a difficult place mentally,\" and adding, \"It is entirely clear to me that the contents of those notes indicate that Gill unfortunately was in a very difficult place at the time of her death.\"\n\nWooderson also stated, \"Having reviewed the evidence I have, it seems to me sadly that the appropriate conclusion on the balance of probabilities I will record a conclusion of suicide.\"\n\nAfter the inquest concluded, Gill's loved ones including her mum, dad, and stepdad left without giving any statements, while her husband James wasn't present for the proceedings on Thursday.\n\nThe inquiry into her tragedy found out she had been found by her spouse, after a worried pal unable to gain entry to their home contacted the celebrated British singer.\n\nJames, the singer of \"Broken Strings\" who put all work on hold after his wife's tragic death, found her upon entering their home with a key he had. He has not yet made any public statement about her sudden passing.\n\nIn January, it was reported James was \"devastated\" by the loss but was striving to stay strong for their two daughters, Elsie, 15, and Ada, five.\n\nBefore her untimely death at the family residence, Gill seemed to be in search of a new home, posting on Facebook: \"Looking for a house to rent in Whitminster ASAP.

A series of notes addressed to her family, friends, and James were also found inside the property.\n\nHere, the Mirror takes a look at Gill's tragic final hours, including the heartbreaking notes she left behind for loved ones.\n\nDevastating discovery\n\nThe inquest heard that the mum-of-two was discovered by her husband James at their family home after a worried friend struggled to gain access to the property and got in touch with him.\n\nYou Give Me Something hitmaker James, who cancelled all work commitments in the wake of his wife's death, used his house key to gain access and was the one who discovered his Gill's body.\n\nPolice and paramedics were called, and Gill was pronounced dead at 9.37am. Gill was identified by her driving licence and family members at the scene, and police at the time stated they were satisfied there were no suspicious circumstances regarding her death.\n\nDetective Sergeant David Kania, who investigated the sudden death, stated: \"A friend of the deceased had attended when they saw a sheet of A4 sheet of paper with the words written, 'Don't come in, call the police'.\n\n\"The friend went to the house and raised the ex-partner, who located a set of keys to the annexe house whereupon they entered and found the deceased.\n\n\"There were no signs of a disturbance or third-party involvement. It has been relayed to me that close friends and family had indicated that Gill had been suffering with her mental health for the last year or so and since the split from her ex-partner. It is likely that this had a further negative detrimental impact on her mental health which culminated in her taking actions which led to her untimely death.\"\n\nSad split\n\nThe inquest today heard that Gill and James had split up a year before the tragedy. Gloucestershire area coroner Roland Wooderson told the court: \"It is clear to me that at the relevant time, Gill was in a difficult place mentally.\"\n\nSince 2012, Gill had undergone treatment for depression and anxiety and had suffered postnatal depression following the births of both her daughters. The court heard how undergoing a kidney transplant last year had triggered further anxiety and had prompted 'negative thoughts of harming herself'.\n\nIn a written statement, GP Dr Emma Basker said Ms Catchpole had also suffered from 'reoccurring mental ill-health', including anxiety and PTSD, and had received medication, counselling and psychological therapy.\n\nNotes for loved ones\n\nDet Sgt Kania said: \"Upon entering the living room, I saw a series of handwritten notes on the lounge table which were addressed to the deceased's ex-partner, family and friends.\n\nDiscussing the notes, Wooderson added: \"It is entirely clear to me that the contents of those notes indicate that Gill unfortunately was in a very difficult place at the time of her death. Having reviewed the evidence I have, it seems to me sadly that the appropriate conclusion on the balance of probabilities I will record a conclusion of suicide.\"\n\nJames, who was reportedly left 'devastated' by Gill's passing, was not present at the inquest.\n\nSearching for new house\n\nAs reported by the Mail Online at the time, Gill had been looking for a new house on the eve of her death, posting in a local Facebook group that she was 'looking for a house to rent in Whitminster ASAP'. Gill wrote: \"Please contact me if anyone knows or hears of anything. TIA [thanks in advance].\"\n\nAnother person then commented: \"Gill is a very dear friend of mine. If anyone has any properties to rent preferably in the Whitminster area please let me know or message Gill directly.\"\n\nLooking forward to 'big changes'\n\nIn an interview with the Mail Online, Whitminster residents known to Gill revealed she was looking to make some 'big changes' at the time of her death, with one person sharing: \"She was always waving, saying hello and stopping to chat. She told me just a few days ago that she was looking forward to the future and making big changes in 2024. I never sensed anything was wrong because that was Gill. She was a very positive and determined person who had gone through a lot recently.\"\n\nAnother said: \"She said she wanted a fresh start this year and was planning big changes. I took it to mean that she wanted to expand the business, which I know she was very keen to do or make a big life change, like go travelling or something.\"\n\nIf you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

The 39-year-old singer tragically lost his wife earlier this year when he discovered the mother of his two children died inside their family home on January 5th.\n\nAccording to the inquest conducted on Thursday (June 20) a worried friend noticed a note on the front door in the aftermath of their split. The Gloucestershire Coroner's Court was informed that a friend had visited Gill's home and found a handwritten note on A4 paper attached to the front door reading, \"Don't come in, call the police\".\n\nREAD MORE: James Morrison's wife sparked 'welfare concerns' from police before tragic death aged 45\n\nREAD MORE: Full Monty star Tom Wilkinson dies 'suddenly' aged 75 as tributes flood in to 'one of the best'\n\nThe worried friend had proceeded to the neighbouring property where the musician resided and James used keys to enter the property and found his former partner's body. Emergency services were alerted, and Gill was declared dead at 9.37am.\n\nDetective Sergeant David Kania, who led the investigation into the sudden death, dismissed any involvement of a third party. He said in a statement: \"A friend of the deceased had attended when they saw a sheet of A4 sheet of paper with the words written, 'Don't come in, call the police'.\n\n\"The friend went to the house and raised the ex-partner, who located a set of keys to the annexe house where upon they entered and found the deceased.

It is likely that this had a further negative detrimental impact on her mental health which culminated in her taking actions which led to her untimely death.\"\n\nIn addition to this, a post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as ligature suspension. Toxicology tests also discovered an alcohol level of 190mg per 100ml of blood more than double the legal limit for driving.\n\nThe inquest was also informed that the toxicologist could not conclude \"whether or not or the degree\" to which the consumption of alcohol affected Gill's mindset at the time of her passing. The court also heard Gill had battled kidney disease since 2008 and had previously undergone a kidney transplant.\n\nDr Emma Basker, Gill's GP at the time, submitted a written statement revealing that she had also grappled with \"reoccurring mental ill-health\". This had manifested as anxiety and PTSD, for which she was prescribed medication, counselling, and psychological therapy.\n\nGloucestershire area coroner Roland Wooderson has concluded that the death of Gill was a suicide. They stated: \"It is quite clear to me that, sadly, at the relevant time Gill was in a difficult place mentally,\" and \"It is entirely clear to me that the contents of those notes indicate that Gill, unfortunately, was in a very difficult place at the time of her death.\"\n\n\"Having reviewed the evidence I have, it seems to me sadly that the appropriate conclusion on the balance of probabilities I will record a conclusion of suicide.\"\n\nGill's family, which includes her mother, father, and step-father were present at the hearing and left without giving any statements. James, Gill's husband, was not in attendance at the Thursday hearing.\n\nThe initial post-mortem report indicated that Gill's cause of death for the mother of two was ligature suspension, with the coroner confirming that Gill had taken her own life. The inquest revealed that Gill was found by her husband James in their home on a Friday, after a friend, unable to enter the house, reached out to the award-winning singer.\n\nGill's sudden passing came shortly after she sought a new home on social media, posting: \"Looking for a house to rent in Whitminster ASAP.

note on door following split'", "body": "JAMES Morrison found his partner dead when a worried pal saw a note on the front door following their split, an inquest heard.\n\nGill Catchpole, 45, was discovered in the annex of the house she shared with the singer and their two daughters on January 5.\n\nAn inquest into Gill's death today heard today how the pair had split around a year before her death, which caused her mental health to decline.\n\nA co-worker of Gill's had called James when he went to pick her up and discovered a note on the front door of the home in Whitminster, Gloucestershire.\n\nTragically, the star discovered his former partner dead in the annex she was living in.\n\nGloucestershire area coroner Roland Wooderson ruled a verdict of suicide after hearing Gill had suffered with a number of health problems, including depression and anxiety.\n\nSinger James did not attend the inquest at Gloucestershire Coroner's Court.\n\nThe hearing was told Gill had been diagnosed with kidney disease and hypertension in 2008 and suffered from postnatal depression in 2010 and 2018.\n\nIn 2020, she was diagnosed with PTSD and received treatment that involved a series of immunosuppressant medication, antidepressants and counselling.\n\nLast year, Gill had a kidney transplant, which triggered further anxiety and \"negative thoughts of harming herself\", the court heard.\n\nShe had felt so low on two occasions that she called the Samaritans but assured her doctor her children and family would keep her causing harm to herself.\n\nThe mum also had a seizure last August that was caused by her anxiety and drinking too heavily.\n\nOn the day she died, police found remnants of a glass of vodka and Coke on a mantelpiece and a half-empty bottle of vodka on the kitchen table.\n\nOfficers also discovered a series of handwritten notes addressed to her family.\n\nPolice said previously they were satisfied there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death.\n\nA post mortem gave a provisional cause of death for the mum-of-two as ligature suspension.\n\nMr Wooderson told the inquest: \"It is clear to me that at the relevant time, Gill was in a difficult place mentally.\"\n\nGill, who shared two daughters aged 15 and five, with James, ran a caf\u00e9 called the Cotswold Sandwich Box.\n\nGill's death is the fourth tragedy to hit Brit Award-winning artist James following the deaths of his dad, brother and nephew.\n\nThe You Give Me Something singer met Gill when he was 17 after she moved into his mum's home with her then-boyfriend.\n\nJames serenaded his future partner by singing songs from Stevie Wonder's album Key Of Life.\n\nThey eventually got together, with the couple later going on to have their children together.\n\nSpeaking to The Sun in 2019, James revealed his album You're Stronger Than You Know was inspired by Gill after their youngest daughter was born 13 weeks premature.\n\nHe said: \"Thankfully I can look back and everything is sweet and rosy now.\"\n\nJames added: \"But when Gill's waters broke and she was born so early and tiny, we didn't know what was going to happen.\n\n\"That's why now, looking back, I called the album You're Stronger Than You Know, as Gill was amazing.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"},

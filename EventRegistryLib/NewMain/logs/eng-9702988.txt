Meloni emphasized that the party has no tolerance for racism or antisemitism and must maintain a consistent and transparent image.\n\nPrime Minister Giorgia Meloni told her Brothers of Italy party on Tuesday that it should expunge from its ranks anyone who idolises Italy's fascist past.\n\nHer call came after an undercover media investigation last week released a video of members of her party's youth wing making fascist salutes and chanting \"Sieg Heil\". In a letter to party leaders, Meloni said she was \"angry and saddened\" that their actions damaged the group's reputation.\n\n\"There is no room in Brothers of Italy for racism or antisemitism, nor is there space for those who are nostalgic for the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century or for any manifestation of foolish folklore,\" she wrote. \"Our task is too great for those who have not understood its scope to be allowed to ruin it.\"\n\nBrothers of Italy traces its roots to a neo-fascist group set up after World War Two, but Meloni herself has looked to distance herself from the far right in recent years and says her party is mainstream conservative. Opposition parties leapt on the investigation by the online newspaper Fanpage. They said it showed Brothers of Italy was a refuge for extreme right-wingers, belying Meloni's efforts to present a moderate image both at home and abroad.\n\nMeloni, who last week denounced the newspaper's undercover methods, said on Tuesday that Brothers of Italy had to be transparent and consistent. \"Anyone who believes there can be a public image of Brothers of Italy that does not correspond to their private behaviour simply does not understand what we are, and thus is not welcome among us,\" she said.\n\nFanpage published clips of youth members chanting \"Duce\", a reference to Italy's fascist leader Benito Mussolini. It also showed a group chat where someone had posted the message: \"Jewish people are a race and I despise them.\" Two youth members resigned last week after the second instalment of the expose was released.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meloni_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meloni government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giorgia Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_of_Italy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brothers of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_salute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roman salute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neo-fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi salute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Totalitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benito Mussolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/13_04_2024_15_37_28_0653994.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702988", "eventUri": "eng-9702988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 235, "relevance": 1}

'Our task is too great for those who have not understood its scope to be allowed to ruin it.'\n\nHidden camera footage has captured members of Italian hard-right leader Giorgia Meloni's youth wing performing fascist salutes and chanting 'Sieg heil' (pictured)\n\nIn the wake of the scandal, Prime Minister Meloni (pictured June 28) told her Brothers of Italy party on Tuesday that it should expunge from its ranks anyone who idolises Italy's fascist past, and reject antisemitism, racism and nostalgia for its past dictatorships\n\nBrothers of Italy traces its roots to a neo-fascist group set up after World War Two.\n\nHowever, Meloni herself has worked to distance herself from the far right in recent years and says her party is mainstream conservative.\n\nBut in a blow to these efforts, opposition parties leapt on the investigation by the online newspaper Fanpage, which was titled 'The Meloni Youth'.\n\nThe publication's journalist pretended to be an activist with National Youth, the youth wing of the Brothers of Italy party, and the report came out in two episodes last month.\n\nFanpage said the footage from a hidden camera showed members of the movement doing fascist salutes, praising Benito Mussolini, defining themselves as fascists and instructing others to spread stickers with fascist slogans.\n\nThis, Fanpage said, showed Brothers of Italy was a refuge for extreme right-wingers, belying Meloni's efforts to present a moderate image both at home and abroad.\n\nMeloni said on Tuesday the Brothers of Italy had to be transparent and consistent.\n\n'Anyone who believes there can be a public image of Brothers of Italy that does not correspond to their private behaviour simply does not understand what we are, and thus is not welcome among us,' she said in the letter.\n\n'There is no room in our ranks for those who play a caricature role that only serves the narrative our opponents want to create about us.\n\n'I and we don't have time to lose with those who want to make us go backward.'\n\nFanpage.it said the footage from a hidden camera (pictured) showed members of the movement doing fascist salutes, praising Benito Mussolini, defining themselves as fascists and instructing others to spread stickers with fascist slogans\n\nFanpage published clips of youth members chanting 'Duce', a reference to Mussolini, and shouting 'Seig heil' - an expression adopted by the Nazis under Adolf Hitler\n\nHowever, Meloni and other lawmakers from her party also criticised the methods deployed by the journalists, saying that the report only represented a small majority of her party's youth movement rather than the party as a whole.\n\nLuca Ciriani, a Brothers of Italy lawmaker, also said the Fanpage report was based on fragmented, out-of-context images.\n\nDespite her efforts to distance the modern iteration of her party from Italy's fascist past, Meloni once again had to remind her party's leadership to move on.\n\nShe also reminded them that Brother of Italy adhered to a 2019 resolution in the European Parliament which condemned all 20th century dictatorships.\n\nShe said this was a 'position' that she has 'no intention of questioning'.\n\nThe report showed that the party's project to bring it into the modern era was not complete, and that nostalgia remains for the days of Mussolini - Italy's fascist leader and 'Duce' (derived from Dux in Latin, or leader) from 1922 to 1945.\n\nHe was summarily executed in 1945 by Italian partisans.\n\nFanpage published clips of youth members chanting 'Duce', a reference to Mussolini, and shouting 'Seig heil' - an expression adopted by the Nazis under Adolf Hitler.\n\nOne man was seen telling the journalists: 'I am a fascist'.\n\nAnother said: 'We are comrades, not dumb a**holes' - contrasted with Meloni telling a crowd of National Youth members: 'I am proud of you.'\n\nThe undercover reporter attended a meeting of the group, where people were seen chanting and making the fascist salutes.\n\nIt also showed that Marco Perissa and Paolo Trancassini, senior members of the Brothers of Italy party, and Nicola Procaccini, an MEP, were also there.\n\nThe clip showed how some greeted attendees with a 'gladiatorial salute' - which, the report says, is when two people grasp each other's wrists in a hand shake.\n\nFanpage's report also showed a group chat where someone had posted the message: 'Jewish people are a race and I despise them.'\n\nTwo youth members - Elisa Segnini and Flaminia Pace - resigned last week after the second instalment of the expose was released.\n\nThey were not expelled, said a spokesperson for the Brothers of Italy party.\n\nPictured: Meloni is seen speaking at a National Youth event in the Fanpage report\n\nFanpage said the footage from a hidden camera showed members of the movement doing fascist salutes, praising Benito Mussolini, defining themselves as fascists and instructing others to spread stickers with fascist slogans (pictured)\n\nLiliana Segre, an Italian senator and holocaust survivor, asked on Italian television after seeing the reports from Fanpage: 'At my age, will I have to see this again?'\n\n'Will I have to be kicked out of my country like I was once kicked out?'\n\nLawmakers from the left of Italian politics spoke out against Meloni.\n\nMichela Di Biase, of Italy's Democratic Party, accused the National Youth of idealising those who 'stained the history of our country with the blood of persecution.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

It also showed a group chat where someone had posted the message: \"Jewish people are a race and I despise them.\"\n\nTwo youth members resigned last week after the second instalment of the expose was released.\n\n(Reporting by Angelo Amante and Crispian Balmer; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meloni_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meloni government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_of_Italy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brothers of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_salute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roman salute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Giorgia Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi salute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neo-fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Totalitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benito Mussolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Fascism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Fascism", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/b770ebf/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F16%2F4ca8fd30cc33bf867e6038de890631%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK610RT%3A12024-07-02T174240Z_1_LYNXMPEK610RT_RTROPTP_3_ITALY-MELONI.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702988", "eventUri": "eng-9702988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

Michela Di Biase, a lawmaker with Italy's Democratic Party, accused Meloni's party youth of idealizing those who \"stained the history of our country with the blood of persecution.\"\n\nMeloni and lawmakers from her party criticized the journalist's methods and said that the news report did not represent the true identity of her party or of its youth movement, but a small minority.

It showed that the transformation was not complete, and that nostalgia for elements of Italy's darkest past persists, at least in some parts of a party that grew from being a fringe movement to becoming Italy's biggest governing force.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgia_Meloni", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Giorgia Meloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_of_Italy", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brothers of Italy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostalgia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nostalgia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Totalitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_fascism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italian fascism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_salute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roman salute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benito Mussolini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slogan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_salute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi salute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pragmatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Socialism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/02/multimedia/02meloni-youth-1-bhlm/02meloni-youth-1-bhlm-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702988", "eventUri": "eng-9702988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

I and we don't have time to lose with those who want to make us go backward.\n\n\"Whoever believes there can be a public image of Brothers of Italy that does not correspond to their private behavior has simply not understood who we are, and is therefore not welcome among us.\"\n\nThe youth wing of the party, known as National Youth, was founded in 2014 and has described itself as \"the most significant youth movement among the Italian parties\".\n\nAs recently as last December, Meloni told supporters at a party rally: \"This is what so many envy of us, that we have young people who still believe in politics and militancy. It is rare; it is priceless.\"\n\nA party spokeswoman said two party officials featured in the report, Elisa Segnini and Flaminia Pace, had subsequently left their official posts but had not yet been expelled.\n\nVictor Fadlun, the president of Rome's Jewish Community, wrote on the social media platform X urging \"appropriate actions be taken\" over the reports.\n\n\"It is imperative that society and institutions react strongly against all forms of hatred and discrimination,\" he said.\n\nMichela Di Biase, a member of Parliament for the left-wing Democratic Party, said the behavior caught on

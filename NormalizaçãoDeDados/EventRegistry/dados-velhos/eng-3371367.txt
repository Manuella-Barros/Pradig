Cisco Systems dropped after issuing a disappointing sales forecast, and retailers were also weak as Wal-Mart slumped. Bond prices rose, sending yields lower.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 25 points, or 1 percent, to 2,442 as of 1:50 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 187 points, or 0.9 percent, to 21,837. The Nasdaq composite lost 86 points, or 1.4 percent, to 6,258. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 14 points, or 1 percent, to 1,369.\n\nWAL-MART HITS A WALL: Wal-Mart Stores did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. Wal-Mart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $1.35, or 1.7 percent, to $79.63 although it is still up 8 percent since July 10.\n\nOther retailers slipped as well. Amazon fell $12.90, or 1.3 percent, to $965.28 and Macy's lost 45 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $19.70.\n\nSTRIPPED BARE: L Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The company said an important sales measurement dropped 8 percent, more than the company had anticipated. L Brands has been slipping all year because of the difficult business conditions for retailers and its own struggles after it stopped selling swimwear. The stock retreated $3.19, or 8.2 percent, to $35.76 and it's down 46 percent this year.\n\nEARNINGS GAINS: Overall it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Profits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies have also posted big gains. Consumer-focused companies haven't done as well.\n\nROUTER OUTAGE: Cisco Systems fell $1.40, or 4.3 percent, to $30.95 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.61, or 6.2 percent, to $39.80. Elsewhere, Apple retreated $2.10, or 1.3 percent, to $158.85 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $3.16, or 2.1 percent, to $148.64 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $1.82, or 2.2 percent, to $80.64.\n\nBONDS: Bond prices inched higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.20 percent from 2.23 percent.\n\nNOT A RENTAL: United Rentals said it will buy smaller competitor Neff for $25 a share, or $596 million. Neff said earlier this week that it received an offer but did not name the buyer. Neff had previously accepted an offer of $21.07 a share from H&E Equipment Services, which declined to make a bigger offer. United Rentals climbed 42 cents to $112.39. Neff, which dipped on Wednesday, rose 30 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $24.85.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $50.94 a barrel in London.\n\nMETALS: Gold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.94 a pound.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 109.77 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1743 from $1.1769.\n\nOVERSEAS: Germany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.\n\n-- -- --\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this story.

Most industries are slipping, with some of the biggest losses going to technology and industrial companies, retailers and banks. After dramatic moves late last week and earlier this week, stocks appear to have returned to the pattern of small moves that has marked this year.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,455 as of 11 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 90 points, or 0.4 percent, to 21,934. The Nasdaq composite lost 47 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,298. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 3 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,379.\n\nWAL-MART HITS A WALL: Wal-Mart Stores did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. Wal-Mart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $1.56, or 1.9 percent, to $79.42 although it is still up 8 percent since July 10.\n\nOther retailers slipped as well. Amazon fell $9.22 to $968.96 and Macy's lost 36 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $19.78.\n\nSTRIPPED BARE: L Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit guidance because of weakening sales. The company said sales at its older stores dropped 8 percent, which was worse than it expected. L Brands has been slipping all year because of the difficult business conditions for retailers and its own struggles after it stopped selling swimwear. The stock retreated $3.68, or 9.4 percent, to $35.27 and it's down 46 percent this year.\n\nROUTER OUTAGE: Cisco Systems fell $1.35, or 4.2 percent, to $30.99 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.65, or 6.2 percent, to $39.76. Elsewhere, Apple retreated $1.70, or 1.1 percent, to $159.25 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $2.41, or 1.6 percent, to $149.39 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $1.18, or 1.4 percent, to $81.28.\n\nNOT A RENTAL: United Rentals said it will buy smaller competitor Neff for $25 a share, or $596 million. Neff said earlier this week that it received an offer but did not name the buyer. Neff had previously accepted an offer of $21.07 a share from H&E Equipment Services, which declined to make a bigger offer. United Rentals climbed $1.72, or 1.5 percent, to $113.69.\n\nBONDS: Bond prices inched higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.22 percent from 2.23 percent.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 17 cents to $46.61 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 6 cents to $50.33 a barrel in London.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 109.83 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1731 from $1.1769.\n\nOVERSEAS: Germany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.\n\n-- -- --\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this story.

Banks also dropped as bond yields and interest rates sank for a second day.\n\nIt was the second-worst day for stocks this year, which has seen few large declines. Along with technology companies and retailers, transportation companies skidded and all of the industrial, financial and basic materials companies in the S&P 500 fell. Those sectors tend to struggle when investors are concerned about economic growth, although there weren't any specific signs of economic trouble Thursday.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 38.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,430.01, its lowest close since July 11. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 21,750.73. The Nasdaq composite sank 123.19 points, or 1.9 percent, to 6,221.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 24.59 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,358.94.\n\nHigh-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate companies fared slightly better than the rest of the market, although they still finished lower. About 95 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 finished with losses.\n\nBill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said that minutes released Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month marked \"a little bit of a change in tone,\" and suggested that the central bank is becoming more cautious about raising interest rates.\n\nThat helped push long-term interest rates in the bond market lower since then. Lower bond yields tend to hurt banks, because it prevents them from charging higher rates on loans, and benefits high-dividend stocks.\n\nInvestors were also assessing the state of President Donald Trump's business-friendly agenda as he continues to face criticism over his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. After he was elected, investors hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would boost corporate profits.\n\n\"Most of the agenda ... has been a little bit distracted by non-economic factors,\" said Northey.\n\nInvestors also looked for safer investments after a deadly van attack in Barcelona that killed at least 13 people and injured 100.\n\nCisco Systems fell $1.30, or 4 percent, to $31.04 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.85, or 6.7 percent, to $39.56. It had a lot of company. Apple retreated $3.08, or 1.9 percent, to $157.87 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $3.57, or 2.4 percent, to $148.23 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.31, or 2.8 percent, to $80.15.\n\nWal-Mart did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. But that wasn't enough to sustain a recent rally in the company's stock, and its shares lost $1.28, or 1.6 percent, to $79.70.\n\nL Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The stock retreated $1.40, or 3.6 percent, to $37.55, and it's down 43 percent this year as retailers slump overall and the company struggles after it decided to stop selling swimwear.\n\nElsewhere, Amazon fell $17.61, or 1.8 percent, to $960.57 and Macy's lost 52 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $19.62.\n\nDespite some shaky reports Thursday, it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Profits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies have also posted big gains. Consumer-focused companies have made smaller gains.\n\nAnalysts, including U.S. Bank's Northey, mostly expect the stock market to keep rising as long as company profits keep growing.\n\nThe only bigger loss for stocks this year came on May 17. At that time, investors were concerned that Trump's pro-business agenda might be affected by allegations he asked the FBI to drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.19 percent from 2.23 percent. The yield on the 2-year note fell to 1.29 percent from 1.33 percent.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.59 per gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.58 a gallon. Natural gas gained 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nGold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.94 a pound.\n\nThe dollar dipped to 109.67 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1742 from $1.1769.\n\nGermany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.\n\n___\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jay",

Most industries are slipping, with some of the biggest losses going to technology and industrial companies, retailers and banks. After dramatic moves late last week and earlier this week, stocks appear to have returned to the pattern of small moves that has marked this year.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,455 as of 11 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 90 points, or 0.4 percent, to 21,934. The Nasdaq composite lost 47 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,298. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 3 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,379.\n\nWAL-MART HITS A WALL: Wal-Mart Stores did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. Wal-Mart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $1.56, or 1.9 percent, to $79.42 although it is still up 8 percent since July 10.\n\nOther retailers slipped as well. Amazon fell $9.22 to $968.96 and Macy's lost 36 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $19.78.\n\nSTRIPPED BARE: L Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit guidance because of weakening sales. The company said sales at its older stores dropped 8 percent, which was worse than it expected. L Brands has been slipping all year because of the difficult business conditions for retailers and its own struggles after it stopped selling swimwear. The stock retreated $3.68, or 9.4 percent, to $35.27 and it's down 46 percent this year.\n\nROUTER OUTAGE: Cisco Systems fell $1.35, or 4.2 percent, to $30.99 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.65, or 6.2 percent, to $39.76. Elsewhere, Apple retreated $1.70, or 1.1 percent, to $159.25 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $2.41, or 1.6 percent, to $149.39 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $1.18, or 1.4 percent, to $81.28.\n\nNOT A RENTAL: United Rentals said it will buy smaller competitor Neff for $25 a share, or $596 million. Neff said earlier this week that it received an offer but did not name the buyer. Neff had previously accepted an offer of $21.07 a share from H&E Equipment Services, which declined to make a bigger offer. United Rentals climbed $1.72, or 1.5 percent, to $113.69.\n\nBONDS: Bond prices inched higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.22 percent from 2.23 percent.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 17 cents to $46.61 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 6 cents to $50.33 a barrel in London.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 109.83 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1731 from $1.1769.\n\nOVERSEAS: Germany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "wgt": 100, "id": 22, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "wgt": 100, "id": 91, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade", "wgt": 100, "id": 348, "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Technology", "wgt": 100, "id": 349, "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Technology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "wgt": 100, "id": 413, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218049"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302591", "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302720", "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303007", "label": {"eng": "NASDAQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303413", "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303975", "label": {"eng": "Website"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304150", "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304201", "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304657", "label": {"eng": "War bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304921", "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305588", "label": {"eng": "Amazon.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_Brands", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "307714", "label": {"eng": "L Brands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria's_Secret", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "307716", "label": {"eng": "Victoria's Secret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307969", "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Systems", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "308856", "label": {"eng": "Adobe Systems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "315208", "label": {"eng": "Cisco Systems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy's", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "318696", "label": {"eng": "Macy's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellwether", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "321081", "label": {"eng": "Bellwether"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "334349", "label": {"eng": "Texas Instruments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Rentals", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "334929", "label": {"eng": "United Rentals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_2000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "375289", "label": {"eng": "Russell 2000 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "445255", "label": {"eng": "NetApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1210925", "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}]}

Banks also dropped as bond yields and interest rates sank for a second day.\n\nIt was the second-worst day for stocks this year, which has seen few large declines. Along with technology companies and retailers, transportation companies skidded and all of the industrial, financial and basic materials companies in the S&P 500 fell. Those sectors tend to struggle when investors are concerned about economic growth, although there weren't any specific signs of economic trouble Thursday.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 38.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,430.01, its lowest close since July 11. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 21,750.73. The Nasdaq composite sank 123.19 points, or 1.9 percent, to 6,221.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 24.59 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,358.94.\n\nHigh-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate companies fared slightly better than the rest of the market, although they still finished lower. About 95 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 finished with losses.\n\nBill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said that minutes released Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month marked \"a little bit of a change in tone,\" and suggested that the central bank is becoming more cautious about raising interest rates.\n\nThat helped push long-term interest rates in the bond market lower since then. Lower bond yields tend to hurt banks, because it prevents them from charging higher rates on loans, and benefits high-dividend stocks.\n\nInvestors were also assessing the state of President Donald Trump's business-friendly agenda as he continues to face criticism over his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. After he was elected, investors hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would boost corporate profits.\n\n\"Most of the agenda ... has been a little bit distracted by non-economic factors,\" said Northey.\n\nInvestors also looked for safer investments after a deadly van attack in Barcelona that killed at least 13 people and injured 100.\n\nCisco Systems fell $1.30, or 4 percent, to $31.04 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.85, or 6.7 percent, to $39.56. It had a lot of company. Apple retreated $3.08, or 1.9 percent, to $157.87 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $3.57, or 2.4 percent, to $148.23 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.31, or 2.8 percent, to $80.15.\n\nWal-Mart did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. But that wasn't enough to sustain a recent rally in the company's stock, and its shares lost $1.28, or 1.6 percent, to $79.70.\n\nL Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The stock retreated $1.40, or 3.6 percent, to $37.55, and it's down 43 percent this year as retailers slump overall and the company struggles after it decided to stop selling swimwear.\n\nElsewhere, Amazon fell $17.61, or 1.8 percent, to $960.57 and Macy's lost 52 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $19.62.\n\nDespite some shaky reports Thursday, it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Profits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies have also posted big gains. Consumer-focused companies have made smaller gains.\n\nAnalysts, including U.S. Bank's Northey, mostly expect the stock market to keep rising as long as company profits keep growing.\n\nThe only bigger loss for stocks this year came on May 17. At that time, investors were concerned that Trump's pro-business agenda might be affected by allegations he asked the FBI to drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.19 percent from 2.23 percent. The yield on the 2-year note fell to 1.29 percent from 1.33 percent.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.59 per gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.58 a gallon. Natural gas gained 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nGold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.94 a pound.\n\nThe dollar dipped to 109.67 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1742 from $1.1769.\n\nGermany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.\n\n___\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at https://apnews.com/search/marley%20jay\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Cisco Systems dropped after issuing a disappointing sales forecast, and retailers were also weak as Wal-Mart slumped. Bond prices continued to climb, sending yields lower, a trend that began a day ago after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its latest meeting.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 30 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,437 as of 3:15 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 206 points, or 0.9 percent, to 21,818. The Nasdaq composite lost 104 points, or 1.6 percent, to 6,240. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 17 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,366.\n\nWAL-MART HITS A WALL: Wal-Mart Stores did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. Wal-Mart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $1.46, or 1.8 percent, to $79.52.\n\nL Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The stock retreated $1.93, or 4.9 percent, to $37.03, and it's down 44 percent this year as retailers slump overall and the company struggles after it decided to stop selling swimwear.\n\nOther retailers slipped as well. Amazon fell $14.16, or 1.4 percent, to $964.02 and Macy's lost 50 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $19.64.\n\nROUTER OUTAGE: Cisco Systems fell $1.45, or 4.5 percent, to $30.89 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.81, or 6.6 percent, to $39.60. Elsewhere, Apple retreated $2.63, or 1.6 percent, to $158.32 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $2.78, or 1.8 percent, to $149.02 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.04, or 2.5 percent, to $80.42.\n\nTHE QUOTE: \"The release of the FOMC minutes (Wednesday) seemed to make a little bit of a change in tone,\" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. He said the Federal Reserve's decision makers are getting more cautious about raising interest rates too quickly. That's pushing interest rates lower, which hurts banks and is better for big-dividend payers like utilities, which held up fairly well during Thursday's selling.\n\nNEWS OVERLOAD: Stocks are on track for one of their worst days of 2017. Along with the dip in interest rates, investors are trying to assess the state of President Donald Trump's agenda as he continues to face criticism over his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. After he was elected, investors hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would boost corporate profits.\n\n\"Most of the agenda ... has been a little bit distracted by non-economic factors,\" said Northey.\n\nInvestors also looked for safer investments after a deadly van attack in Barcelona that killed at least 13 people and injured 50.\n\nEARNINGS GAINS: Overall it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Profits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies have also posted big gains. Consumer-focused companies haven't done as well.\n\nBONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.20 percent from 2.23 percent.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.59 per gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.58 a gallon. Natural gas gained 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nMETALS: Gold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.94 a pound.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 109.67 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1742 from $1.1769.\n\nOVERSEAS: Germany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.\n\n___\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this story.

Most industries are slipping, with some of the biggest losses going to technology and industrial companies, retailers and banks. After dramatic moves late last week and earlier this week, stocks appear to have returned to the pattern of small moves that has marked this year.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,455 as of 11 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 90 points, or 0.4 percent, to 21,934. The Nasdaq composite lost 47 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,298. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 3 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,379.\n\nWAL-MART HITS A WALL: Wal-Mart Stores did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. Wal-Mart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $1.56, or 1.9 percent, to $79.42 although it is still up 8 percent since July 10.\n\nOther retailers slipped as well. Amazon fell $9.22 to $968.96 and Macy's lost 36 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $19.78.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nSTRIPPED BARE: L Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit guidance because of weakening sales. The company said sales at its older stores dropped 8 percent, which was worse than it expected. L Brands has been slipping all year because of the difficult business conditions for retailers and its own struggles after it stopped selling swimwear. The stock retreated $3.68, or 9.4 percent, to $35.27 and it's down 46 percent this year.\n\nROUTER OUTAGE: Cisco Systems fell $1.35, or 4.2 percent, to $30.99 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.65, or 6.2 percent, to $39.76. Elsewhere, Apple retreated $1.70, or 1.1 percent, to $159.25 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $2.41, or 1.6 percent, to $149.39 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $1.18, or 1.4 percent, to $81.28.\n\nNOT A RENTAL: United Rentals said it will buy smaller competitor Neff for $25 a share, or $596 million. Neff said earlier this week that it received an offer but did not name the buyer.

Banks also dropped as bond yields and interest rates sank for a second day.\n\nIt was the second-worst day for stocks this year, which has seen few large declines. Along with technology companies and retailers, transportation companies skidded and all of the industrial, financial and basic materials companies in the S&P 500 fell. Those sectors tend to struggle when investors are concerned about economic growth, although there weren't any specific signs of economic trouble Thursday.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 38.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,430.01, its lowest close since July 11. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 21,750.73. The Nasdaq composite sank 123.19 points, or 1.9 percent, to 6,221.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 24.59 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,358.94.\n\nHigh-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate companies fared slightly better than the rest of the market, although they still finished lower. About 95 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 finished with losses.\n\nBill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said that minutes released Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month marked \"a little bit of a change in tone,\" and suggested that the central bank is becoming more cautious about raising interest rates.\n\nThat helped push long-term interest rates in the bond market lower since then. Lower bond yields tend to hurt banks, because it prevents them from charging higher rates on loans, and benefits high-dividend stocks.\n\nInvestors were also assessing the state of President Donald Trump's business-friendly agenda as he continues to face criticism over his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. After he was elected, investors hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would boost corporate profits.\n\n\"Most of the agenda ... has been a little bit distracted by non-economic factors,\" said Northey.\n\nInvestors also looked for safer investments after a deadly van attack in Barcelona that killed at least 12 people and injured 80.\n\nCisco Systems fell $1.30, or 4 percent, to $31.04 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.85, or 6.7 percent, to $39.56. It had a lot of company. Apple retreated $3.08, or 1.9 percent, to $157.87 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $3.57, or 2.4 percent, to $148.23 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.31, or 2.8 percent, to $80.15.\n\nWal-Mart did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. But that wasn't enough to sustain a recent rally in the company's stock, and its shares lost $1.28, or 1.6 percent, to $79.70.\n\nL Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The stock retreated $1.40, or 3.6 percent, to $37.55, and it's down 43 percent this year as retailers slump overall and the company struggles after it decided to stop selling swimwear.\n\nElsewhere, Amazon fell $17.61, or 1.8 percent, to $960.57 and Macy's lost 52 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $19.62.\n\nDespite some shaky reports Thursday, it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Profits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies have also posted big gains. Consumer-focused companies have made smaller gains.\n\nAnalysts, including U.S. Bank's Northey, mostly expect the stock market to keep rising as long as company profits keep growing.\n\nThe only bigger loss for stocks this year came on May 17. At that time, investors were concerned that Trump's pro-business agenda might be affected by allegations he asked the FBI to drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.19 percent from 2.23 percent. The yield on the 2-year note fell to 1.29 percent from 1.33 percent.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.59 per gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.58 a gallon. Natural gas gained 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nGold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.94 a pound.\n\nThe dollar dipped to 109.67 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1742 from $1.1769.\n\nGermany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent.

Cisco Systems dropped after issuing a disappointing sales forecast, and retailers were also weak as Wal-Mart slumped. Bond prices continued to climb, sending yields lower, a trend that began a day ago after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its latest meeting.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 30 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,437 as of 3:15 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 206 points, or 0.9 percent, to 21,818. The Nasdaq composite lost 104 points, or 1.6 percent, to 6,240. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 17 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,366.\n\nWAL-MART HITS A WALL: Wal-Mart Stores did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. Wal-Mart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $1.46, or 1.8 percent, to $79.52.\n\nL Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The stock retreated $1.93, or 4.9 percent, to $37.03, and it's down 44 percent this year as retailers slump overall and the company struggles after it decided to stop selling swimwear.\n\nOther retailers slipped as well. Amazon fell $14.16, or 1.4 percent, to $964.02 and Macy's lost 50 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $19.64.\n\nROUTER OUTAGE: Cisco Systems fell $1.45, or 4.5 percent, to $30.89 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.81, or 6.6 percent, to $39.60. Elsewhere, Apple retreated $2.63, or 1.6 percent, to $158.32 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $2.78, or 1.8 percent, to $149.02 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.04, or 2.5 percent, to $80.42.\n\nTHE QUOTE: \"The release of the FOMC minutes (Wednesday) seemed to make a little bit of a change in tone,\" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. He said the Federal Reserve's decision makers are getting more cautious about raising interest rates too quickly. That's pushing interest rates lower, which hurts banks and is better for big-dividend payers like utilities, which held up fairly well during Thursday's selling.\n\nNEWS OVERLOAD: Stocks are on track for one of their worst days of 2017. Along with the dip in interest rates, investors are trying to assess the state of President Donald Trump's agenda as he continues to face criticism over his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. After he was elected, investors hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would boost corporate profits.\n\n\"Most of the agenda ... has been a little bit distracted by non-economic factors,\" said Northey.\n\nInvestors also looked for safer investments after a deadly van attack in Barcelona that killed at least 13 people and injured 50.\n\nEARNINGS GAINS: Overall it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Profits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies have also posted big gains. Consumer-focused companies haven't done as well.\n\nBONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.20 percent from 2.23 percent.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.59 per gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.58 a gallon. Natural gas gained 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nMETALS: Gold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.94 a pound.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 109.67 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1742 from $1.1769.\n\nOVERSEAS: Germany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.\n\n___\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this story.

Banks also dropped as bond yields and interest rates sank for a second day.\n\nIt was the second-worst day for stocks this year, which has seen few large declines. Along with technology companies and retailers, transportation companies skidded and all of the industrial, financial and basic materials companies in the S&P 500 fell. Those sectors tend to struggle when investors are concerned about economic growth, although there weren't any specific signs of economic trouble Thursday.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 38.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,430.01, its lowest close since July 11. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 21,750.73. The Nasdaq composite sank 123.19 points, or 1.9 percent, to 6,221.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 24.59 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,358.94.\n\nHigh-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate companies fared slightly better than the rest of the market, although they still finished lower. About 95 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 finished with losses.\n\nBill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said that minutes released Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month marked \"a little bit of a change in tone,\" and suggested that the central bank is becoming more cautious about raising interest rates.\n\nThat helped push long-term interest rates in the bond market lower since then. Lower bond yields tend to hurt banks, because it prevents them from charging higher rates on loans, and benefits high-dividend stocks.\n\nInvestors were also assessing the state of President Donald Trump's business-friendly agenda as he continues to face criticism over his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. After he was elected, investors hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would boost corporate profits.\n\n\"Most of the agenda ... has been a little bit distracted by non-economic factors,\" said Northey.\n\nInvestors also looked for safer investments after a deadly van attack in Barcelona that killed at least 12 people and injured 80.\n\nCisco Systems fell $1.30, or 4 percent, to $31.04 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.85, or 6.7 percent, to $39.56. It had a lot of company. Apple retreated $3.08, or 1.9 percent, to $157.87 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $3.57, or 2.4 percent, to $148.23 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.31, or 2.8 percent, to $80.15.\n\nWal-Mart did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. But that wasn't enough to sustain a recent rally in the company's stock, and its shares lost $1.28, or 1.6 percent, to $79.70.\n\nL Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The stock retreated $1.40, or 3.6 percent, to $37.55, and it's down 43 percent this year as retailers slump overall and the company struggles after it decided to stop selling swimwear.\n\nElsewhere, Amazon fell $17.61, or 1.8 percent, to $960.57 and Macy's lost 52 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $19.62.\n\nDespite some shaky reports Thursday, it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Profits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies have also posted big gains. Consumer-focused companies have made smaller gains.\n\nAnalysts, including U.S. Bank's Northey, mostly expect the stock market to keep rising as long as company profits keep growing.\n\nThe only bigger loss for stocks this year came on May 17. At that time, investors were concerned that Trump's pro-business agenda might be affected by allegations he asked the FBI to drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.19 percent from 2.23 percent. The yield on the 2-year note fell to 1.29 percent from 1.33 percent.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.59 per gallon.

Banks also dropped as bond yields and interest rates sank for a second day.\n\nIt was the second-worst day for stocks this year, which has seen few large declines. Along with technology companies and retailers, transportation companies skidded and all of the industrial, financial and basic materials companies in the S&P 500 fell. Those sectors tend to struggle when investors are concerned about economic growth, although there weren't any specific signs of economic trouble Thursday.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 38.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,430.01, its lowest close since July 11. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 21,750.73. The Nasdaq composite sank 123.19 points, or 1.9 percent, to 6,221.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 24.59 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,358.94.\n\nHigh-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate companies fared slightly better than the rest of the market, although they still finished lower. About 95 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 finished with losses.\n\nBill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said that minutes released Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month marked \"a little bit of a change in tone,\" and suggested that the central bank is becoming more cautious about raising interest rates.\n\nThat helped push long-term interest rates in the bond market lower since then. Lower bond yields tend to hurt banks, because it prevents them from charging higher rates on loans, and benefits high-dividend stocks.\n\nInvestors were also assessing the state of President Donald Trump's business-friendly agenda as he continues to face criticism over his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. After he was elected, investors hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would boost corporate profits.\n\n\"Most of the agenda ... has been a little bit distracted by non-economic factors,\" said Northey.\n\nInvestors also looked for safer investments after a deadly van attack in Barcelona that killed at least 13 people and injured 100.\n\nCisco Systems fell $1.30, or 4 percent, to $31.04 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.85, or 6.7 percent, to $39.56. It had a lot of company. Apple retreated $3.08, or 1.9 percent, to $157.87 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $3.57, or 2.4 percent, to $148.23 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.31, or 2.8 percent, to $80.15.\n\nWal-Mart did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. But that wasn't enough to sustain a recent rally in the company's stock, and its shares lost $1.28, or 1.6 percent, to $79.70.\n\nL Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The stock retreated $1.40, or 3.6 percent, to $37.55, and it's down 43 percent this year as retailers slump overall and the company struggles after it decided to stop selling swimwear.\n\nElsewhere, Amazon fell $17.61, or 1.8 percent, to $960.57 and Macy's lost 52 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $19.62.\n\nDespite some shaky reports Thursday, it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Profits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies have also posted big gains. Consumer-focused companies have made smaller gains.\n\nAnalysts, including U.S. Bank's Northey, mostly expect the stock market to keep rising as long as company profits keep growing.\n\nThe only bigger loss for stocks this year came on May 17. At that time, investors were concerned that Trump's pro-business agenda might be affected by allegations he asked the FBI to drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.19 percent from 2.23 percent. The yield on the 2-year note fell to 1.29 percent from 1.33 percent.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.59 per gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.58 a gallon. Natural gas gained 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nGold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.94 a pound.\n\nThe dollar dipped to 109.67 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1742 from $1.1769.\n\nGermany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri":

Cisco Systems dropped after issuing a disappointing sales forecast, and retailers were also weak as Wal-Mart slumped. Bond prices continued to climb, sending yields lower, a trend that began a day ago after the Federal Reserve released minutes from its latest meeting.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 30 points, or 1.2 percent, to 2,437 as of 3:15 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 206 points, or 0.9 percent, to 21,818. The Nasdaq composite lost 104 points, or 1.6 percent, to 6,240. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 17 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,366.\n\nWAL-MART HITS A WALL: Wal-Mart Stores did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. Wal-Mart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $1.46, or 1.8 percent, to $79.52.\n\nL Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The stock retreated $1.93, or 4.9 percent, to $37.03, and it's down 44 percent this year as retailers slump overall and the company struggles after it decided to stop selling swimwear.\n\nOther retailers slipped as well. Amazon fell $14.16, or 1.4 percent, to $964.02 and Macy's lost 50 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $19.64.\n\nROUTER OUTAGE: Cisco Systems fell $1.45, or 4.5 percent, to $30.89 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.81, or 6.6 percent, to $39.60. Elsewhere, Apple retreated $2.63, or 1.6 percent, to $158.32 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $2.78, or 1.8 percent, to $149.02 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.04, or 2.5 percent, to $80.42.\n\nTHE QUOTE: \"The release of the FOMC minutes (Wednesday) seemed to make a little bit of a change in tone,\" said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. He said the Federal Reserve's decision makers are getting more cautious about raising interest rates too quickly. That's pushing interest rates lower, which hurts banks and is better for big-dividend payers like utilities, which held up fairly well during Thursday's selling.\n\nNEWS OVERLOAD: Stocks are on track for one of their worst days of 2017. Along with the dip in interest rates, investors are trying to assess the state of President Donald Trump's agenda as he continues to face criticism over his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. After he was elected, investors hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would boost corporate profits.\n\n\"Most of the agenda ... has been a little bit distracted by non-economic factors,\" said Northey.\n\nInvestors also looked for safer investments after a deadly van attack in Barcelona that killed at least 13 people and injured 50.\n\nEARNINGS GAINS: Overall it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Profits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies have also posted big gains. Consumer-focused companies haven't done as well.\n\nBONDS: Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.20 percent from 2.23 percent.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.59 per gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.58 a gallon. Natural gas gained 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nMETALS: Gold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.94 a pound.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 109.67 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1742 from $1.1769.\n\nOVERSEAS: Germany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this story. He can be reached at @MarleyJayAP.

Banks also dropped as bond yields and interest rates sank for a second day.\n\nIt was the second-worst day for stocks this year, which has seen few large declines. Along with technology companies and retailers, transportation companies skidded and all of the industrial, financial and basic materials companies in the S&P 500 fell.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 38.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,430.01, its lowest close since July 11. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 21,750.73. The Nasdaq composite sank 123.19 points, or 1.9 percent, to 6,221.91.

Apple retreated $3.08, or 1.9 percent, to $157.87 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $3.57, or 2.4 percent, to $148.23 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.31, or 2.8 percent, to $80.15.\n\nWal-Mart did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. But that wasn't enough to sustain a recent rally in the company's stock, and its shares lost $1.28, or 1.6 percent, to $79.70.\n\nElsewhere, Amazon fell $17.61, or 1.8 percent, to $960.57 and Macy's lost 52 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $19.62.\n\nDespite some shaky reports Thursday, it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Profits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies have also posted big gains. Consumer-focused companies have made smaller gains.\n\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.19 percent from 2.23 percent. The yield on the 2-year note fell to 1.29 percent from 1.33 percent.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.59 per gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.58 a gallon. Natural gas gained 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nGold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.94 a pound.\n\nThe dollar dipped to 109.67 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1742 from $1.1769.\n\nGermany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri":

Banks also dropped as bond yields and interest rates sank for a second day.\n\nIt was the second-worst day for stocks this year, which has seen few large declines. Along with technology companies and retailers, transportation companies skidded and all of the industrial, financial and basic materials companies in the S&P 500 fell. Those sectors tend to struggle when investors are concerned about economic growth, although there weren't any specific signs of economic trouble Thursday.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 38.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,430.01, its lowest close since July 11. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 21,750.73. The Nasdaq composite sank 123.19 points, or 1.9 percent, to 6,221.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 24.59 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,358.94.\n\nHigh-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate companies fared slightly better than the rest of the market, although they still finished lower. About 95 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 finished with losses.\n\nBill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said that minutes released Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month marked \"a little bit of a change in tone,\" and suggested that the central bank is becoming more cautious about raising interest rates.\n\nThat helped push long-term interest rates in the bond market lower since then. Lower bond yields tend to hurt banks, because it prevents them from charging higher rates on loans, and benefits high-dividend stocks.\n\nInvestors were also assessing the state of President Donald Trump's business-friendly agenda as he continues to face criticism over his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, over the weekend. After he was elected, investors hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would boost corporate profits.\n\n\"Most of the agenda ... has been a little bit distracted by non-economic factors,\" said Northey.\n\nInvestors also looked for safer investments after a deadly van attack in Barcelona that killed at least 13 people and injured 100.\n\nCisco Systems fell $1.30, or 4 percent, to $31.04 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.85, or 6.7 percent, to $39.56. It had a lot of company. Apple retreated $3.08, or 1.9 percent, to $157.87 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $3.57, or 2.4 percent, to $148.23 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.31, or 2.8 percent, to $80.15.\n\nWal-Mart did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. But that wasn't enough to sustain a recent rally in the company's stock, and its shares lost $1.28, or 1.6 percent, to $79.70.\n\nL Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The stock retreated $1.40, or 3.6 percent, to $37.55, and it's down 43 percent this year as retailers slump overall and the company struggles after it decided to stop selling swimwear.\n\nElsewhere, Amazon fell $17.61, or 1.8 percent, to $960.57 and Macy's lost 52 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $19.62.\n\nDespite some shaky reports Thursday, it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Profits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies have also posted big gains. Consumer-focused companies have made smaller gains.\n\nAnalysts, including U.S. Bank's Northey, mostly expect the stock market to keep rising as long as company profits keep growing.\n\nThe only bigger loss for stocks this year came on May 17. At that time, investors were concerned that Trump's pro-business agenda might be affected by allegations he asked the FBI to drop an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.19 percent from 2.23 percent. The yield on the 2-year note fell to 1.29 percent from 1.33 percent.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.59 per gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.58 a gallon. Natural gas gained 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nGold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.94 a pound.\n\nThe dollar dipped to 109.67 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1742 from $1.1769.\n\nGermany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent.

Banks also dropped as bond yields and interest rates sank for a second day.\n\nIt was the second-worst day for stocks this year, which has seen few large declines.\n\nAlong with technology companies and retailers, transportation companies skidded and all of the industrial, financial and basic materials companies in the S&P 500 fell. Those sectors tend to struggle when investors are concerned about economic growth, although there weren't any specific signs of economic trouble Thursday.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 38.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,430.01, its lowest close since July 11. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 21,750.73. The Nasdaq composite sank 123.19 points, or 1.9 percent, to 6,221.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 24.59 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,358.94.\n\nHigh-dividend stocks such as utilities and real estate companies fared slightly better than the rest of the market, although they still finished lower. About 95 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 finished with losses.\n\nBill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said that minutes released Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month marked \"a little bit of a change in tone,\" and suggested that the central bank is becoming more cautious about raising interest rates.\n\nThat helped push long-term interest rates in the bond market lower since then. Lower bond yields tend to hurt banks, because it prevents them from charging higher rates on loans, and benefits high-dividend stocks.\n\nInvestors also were assessing the state of President Trump's business-friendly agenda as he continues to face criticism over his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend. After he was elected, investors hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would boost corporate profits.\n\n\"Most of the agenda ... has been a little bit distracted by noneconomic factors,\" Northey said.\n\nInvestors also looked for safer investments after a deadly van attack in Barcelona, Spain, that killed at least 13 people and injured 100.\n\nCisco Systems fell $1.30, or 4 percent, to $31.04 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.85, or 6.7 percent, to $39.56. It had a lot of company.\n\nApple retreated $3.08, or 1.9 percent, to $157.87 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $3.57, or 2.4 percent, to $148.23 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.31, or 2.8 percent, to $80.15.\n\nWalmart did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. But that wasn't enough to sustain a recent rally in the company's stock, and its shares lost $1.28, or 1.6 percent, to $79.70.\n\nL Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The stock retreated $1.40, or 3.6 percent, to $37.55, and it's down 43 percent this year as retailers slump overall and the company struggles after it decided to stop selling swimwear.\n\nElsewhere, Amazon fell $17.61, or 1.8 percent, to $960.57 and Macy's lost 52 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $19.62.\n\nDespite some shaky reports Thursday, it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago.\n\nProfits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies have also posted big gains. Consumer-\u00adfocused companies have made smaller gains.\n\nAnalysts, including U.S. Bank's Northey, mostly expect the stock market to keep rising as long as company profits keep growing.\n\nThe only bigger loss for stocks this year came on May 17. At that time, investors were concerned that Trump's pro-business agenda might be affected by allegations he asked the FBI to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.19 percent from 2.23 percent. The yield on the 2-year note fell to 1.29 percent from 1.33 percent.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nWholesale gasoline added 2 cents to $1.59 per gallon. Heating oil picked up 1 cent to $1.58 a gallon. Natural gas gained 4 cents to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nGold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.94 a pound.\n\nThe dollar dipped to 109.67 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1742 from $1.1769.\n\nGermany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri":

Most industries are slipping, with some of the biggest losses going to technology and industrial companies, retailers and banks. After dramatic moves late last week and earlier this week, stocks appear to have returned to the pattern of small moves that has marked this year.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8 points, or 0. percent, to 2,459 as of 10 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 90 points, or 0.4 percent, to 21,933. The Nasdaq composite lost 30 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,314. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks remained at 1,384.\n\nWAL-MART HITS A WALL: Wal-Mart Stores did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores as well. But Wal-Mart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $2.05, or 2.5 percent, to $78.94 although it is still up 8 percent since July 10.\n\nSTRIPPED BARE: L Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit guidance because of weakening sales. The company said sales at its older stores dropped 8 percent, which was worse than it expected. L Brands has been slipping all year because of the difficult business conditions for retailers and its own struggles after it stopped selling swimwear. The stock retreated $2.76, or 7.1 percent, to $36.19 and it's down 45 percent this year.\n\nROUTER OUTAGE: Cisco Systems fell $1.10, or 3.4 percent, to $31.24 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nNOT A RENTAL: United Rentals said it will buy smaller competitor Neff for $25 a share, or $596 million. Neff said earlier this week that it received an offer but did not name the buyer. Neff had previously accepted an offer of $21.07 a share from H&E Equipment Services, which declined to make a bigger offer. United Rentals climbed $2.75, or 2.5 percent, to $114.72.\n\nBONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stayed at 2.23 percent.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 2 cents to $46.76 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 1 cent to $50.26 per barrel in London.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 110.10 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1717 from $1.1769.\n\nOVERSEAS: Germany's DAX edged 0.1 percent lower and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 gave up 0.4 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.\n\n___\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this story.

Most industries are slipping, with some of the biggest losses going to technology and industrial companies, retailers and banks. After dramatic moves late last week and earlier this week, stocks appear to have returned to the pattern of small moves that has marked this year.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8 points, or 0. percent, to 2,459 as of 10 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 90 points, or 0.4 percent, to 21,933. The Nasdaq composite lost 30 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,314. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks remained at 1,384.\n\nWAL-MART HITS A WALL: Wal-Mart Stores did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores as well. But Wal-Mart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $2.05, or 2.5 percent, to $78.94 although it is still up 8 percent since July 10.\n\nSTRIPPED BARE: L Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit guidance because of weakening sales. The company said sales at its older stores dropped 8 percent, which was worse than it expected. L Brands has been slipping all year because of the difficult business conditions for retailers and its own struggles after it stopped selling swimwear. The stock retreated $2.76, or 7.1 percent, to $36.19 and it's down 45 percent this year.\n\nROUTER OUTAGE: Cisco Systems fell $1.10, or 3.4 percent, to $31.24 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nNOT A RENTAL: United Rentals said it will buy smaller competitor Neff for $25 a share, or $596 million. Neff said earlier this week that it received an offer but did not name the buyer. Neff had previously accepted an offer of $21.07 a share from H&E Equipment Services, which declined to make a bigger offer. United Rentals climbed $2.75, or 2.5 percent, to $114.72.\n\nBONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stayed at 2.23 percent.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 2 cents to $46.76 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 1 cent to $50.26 per barrel in London.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 110.10 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1717 from $1.1769.\n\nOVERSEAS: Germany's DAX edged 0.1 percent lower and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 gave up 0.4 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "wgt": 100, "id": 22, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "wgt": 100, "id": 91, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100, "id": 268, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade", "wgt": 100, "id": 348, "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Technology", "wgt": 100, "id": 349, "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Technology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 100, "id": 716, "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302536", "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302591", "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASDAQ", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303007", "label": {"eng": "NASDAQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303975", "label": {"eng": "Website"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304201", "label": {"eng": "Dow Jones Industrial Average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304657", "label": {"eng": "War bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304921", "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_Brands", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "307714", "label": {"eng": "L Brands"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria's_Secret", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "307716", "label": {"eng": "Victoria's Secret"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307969", "label": {"eng": "Walmart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "315208", "label": {"eng": "Cisco Systems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellwether", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "321081", "label": {"eng": "Bellwether"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Rentals", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "334929", "label": {"eng": "United Rentals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_2000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "375289", "label": {"eng": "Russell 2000 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1210925", "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}]}

Banks also dropped as bond yields and interest rates sank for a second day.\n\nIt was the second-worst day for stocks this year, which has seen few large declines. Along with technology companies and retailers, transportation companies skidded, and all of the industrial, financial and basic-materials companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 fell. Those sectors tend to struggle when investors are concerned about economic growth, although there weren't any specific signs of economic trouble Thursday.\n\nThe S&P 500 index fell 38.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,430.01, its lowest close since July 11. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 21,750.73. The Nasdaq composite sank 123.19 points, or 1.9 percent, to 6,221.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 24.59 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,358.94.\n\nHigh-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate companies fared slightly better than the rest of the market, although they still finished lower. About 95 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 finished with losses.\n\nBill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, said that minutes released Wednesday from the Federal Reserve's policy meeting last month marked \"a little bit of a change in tone,\" and suggested that the central bank is becoming more cautious about raising interest rates.\n\nThat helped push long-term interest rates in the bond market lower since then. Lower bond yields tend to hurt banks, because it prevents them from charging higher rates on loans, and benefits high-dividend stocks.\n\nInvestors also were assessing the state of President Donald Trump's business-friendly agenda as he continues to face criticism over his comments after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend. After he was elected, investors hoped his proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending would improve corporate profits.\n\n\"Most of the agenda ... has been a little bit distracted by noneconomic factors,\" said Northey.\n\nInvestors also looked for safer investments after a deadly van attack in Barcelona.\n\nCisco Systems fell $1.30, or 4 percent, to $31.04 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 percent to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData-storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.85, or 6.7 percent, to $39.56. It had a lot of company. Apple retreated $3.08, or 1.9 percent, to $157.87 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $3.57, or 2.4 percent, to $148.23 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.31, or 2.8 percent, to $80.15.\n\nWal-Mart did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people went to its stores. But that wasn't enough to sustain a recent rally in the company's stock, and its shares lost $1.28, or 1.6 percent, to $79.70.\n\nL Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The stock retreated $1.40, or 3.6 percent, to $37.55, and it's down 43 percent this year as retailers slump overall and the company struggles after it decided to stop selling swimwear.\n\nElsewhere, Amazon fell $17.61, or 1.8 percent, to $960.57 and shares of Macy's fell 52 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $19.62.\n\nDespite some shaky reports Thursday, it's been another strong quarter of corporate earnings. Per-share profits for S&P 500 companies have grown almost 11 percent in the second quarter versus the same period a year ago. Profits for energy companies have quadrupled because the price of oil has stabilized, and technology companies also have posted big gains. Consumer-focused companies have made smaller gains.\n\nAnalysts, including U.S. Bank's Northey, mostly expect the stock market to keep rising as long as company profits keep growing.\n\nThe only bigger loss for stocks this year came on May 17. At that time, investors were concerned that Trump's pro-business agenda might be affected by allegations he asked the FBI to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.19 percent from 2.23 percent. The yield on the two-year note fell to 1.29 percent from 1.33 percent.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nGold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce.

Most industries are slipping, with some of the biggest losses going to technology and industrial companies, retailers and banks. After dramatic moves late last week and earlier this week, stocks appear to have returned to the pattern of small moves that has marked this year.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8 points, or 0. percent, to 2,459 as of 10 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 90 points, or 0.4 percent, to 21,933. The Nasdaq composite lost 30 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,314. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks remained at 1,384.\n\nWAL-MART HITS A WALL: Wal-Mart Stores did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores as well. But Wal-Mart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $2.05, or 2.5 percent, to $78.94 although it is still up 8 percent since July 10.\n\nFILE - This Wednesday, Dec. 21, 2016, file photo shows the New York Stock Exchange.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)\n\nSTRIPPED BARE: L Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit guidance because of weakening sales. The company said sales at its older stores dropped 8 percent, which was worse than it expected. L Brands has been slipping all year because of the difficult business conditions for retailers and its own struggles after it stopped selling swimwear. The stock retreated $2.76, or 7.1 percent, to $36.19 and it's down 45 percent this year.\n\nROUTER OUTAGE: Cisco Systems fell $1.10, or 3.4 percent, to $31.24 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nNOT A RENTAL: United Rentals said it will buy smaller competitor Neff for $25 a share, or $596 million. Neff said earlier this week that it received an offer but did not name the buyer. Neff had previously accepted an offer of $21.07 a share from H&E Equipment Services, which declined to make a bigger offer. United Rentals climbed $2.75, or 2.5 percent, to $114.72.\n\nBONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stayed at 2.23 percent.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 2 cents to $46.76 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 1 cent to $50.26 per barrel in London.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 110.10 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1717 from $1.1769.\n\nOVERSEAS: Germany's DAX edged 0.1 percent lower and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 gave up 0.4 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.\n\n___\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this story.

Banks also dropped as bond yields and interest rates sank for a second day.\n\nIt was the second-worst day for stocks this year, which has seen few large declines. Along with technology companies and retailers, transportation companies skidded and all of the industrial, financial, and basic materials companies in the S&P 500 fell. Those sectors tend to struggle when investors are concerned about economic growth, although there weren't any specific signs of economic trouble Thursday.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 38.10 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,430.01, its lowest close since July 11. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 274.14 points, or 1.2 percent, to 21,750.73. The Nasdaq composite sank 123.19 points, or 1.9 percent, to 6,221.91. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 24.59 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,358.94.\n\nHigh-dividend stocks like utilities and real estate companies fared slightly better than the rest of the market, although they still finished lower. About 95 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 finished with losses.\n\nInvestors also looked for safer investments after a deadly van attack in Barcelona that killed at least 13 people and injured 100.\n\nCisco Systems fell $1.30, or 4 percent, to $31.04 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It is expecting a decline of 1 percent to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nData storage company NetApp offered a forecast for the current quarter that disappointed investors. Its stock lost $2.85, or 6.7 percent, to $39.56. It had a lot of company. Apple retreated $3.08, or 1.9 percent, to $157.87 while software maker Adobe Systems skidded $3.57, or 2.4 percent, to $148.23 and chipmaker Texas Instruments fell $2.31, or 2.8 percent, to $80.15.\n\nWal-Mart did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. But that wasn't enough to sustain a recent rally in the company's stock, and its shares lost $1.28, or 1.6 percent, to $79.70.\n\nL Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit forecast because of weakening sales. The stock retreated $1.40, or 3.6 percent, to $37.55, and it's down 43 percent this year as retailers slump overall and the company struggles after it decided to stop selling swimwear.\n\nElsewhere, Amazon fell $17.61, or 1.8 percent, to $960.57 and Macy's lost 52 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $19.62.\n\nBond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.19 percent from 2.23 percent. The yield on the 2-year note fell to 1.29 percent from 1.33 percent.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude rose 31 cents to $47.09 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 76 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $51.03 a barrel in London.\n\nGold rose $9.50 to $1,292.40 an ounce. Silver added 11 cents to $17.05 an ounce. Copper lost 2 cents to $2.94 a pound.\n\nThe dollar dipped to 109.67 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1742 from $1.1769.\n\nPublished: August 18, 2017 \u00e2\u0080\" 3:01 AM EDT Thanks for your continued support...\n\nWe recently asked you to support our journalism.

Most industries are slipping, with some of the biggest losses going to technology and industrial companies, retailers and banks. After dramatic moves late last week and earlier this week, stocks appear to have returned to the pattern of small moves that has marked this year.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8 points, or 0. percent, to 2,459 as of 9 a.m. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 90 points, or 0.4 percent, to 21,933. The Nasdaq composite lost 30 points, or 0.5 percent, to 6,314. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks remained at 1,384.\n\nWAL-MART HITS A WALL: Wal-Mart Stores did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores as well. But Wal-Mart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $2.05, or 2.5 percent, to $78.94 although it is still up 8 percent since July 10.\n\nSTRIPPED BARE: L Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit guidance because of weakening sales. The company said sales at its older stores dropped 8 percent, which was worse than it expected. L Brands has been slipping all year because of the difficult business conditions for retailers and its own struggles after it stopped selling swimwear. The stock retreated $2.76, or 7.1 percent, to $36.19 and it's down 45 percent this year.\n\nROUTER OUTAGE: Cisco Systems fell $1.10, or 3.4 percent, to $31.24 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 percent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nNOT A RENTAL: United Rentals said it will buy smaller competitor Neff for $25 a share, or $596 million. Neff said earlier this week that it received an offer but did not name the buyer. Neff had previously accepted an offer of $21.07 a share from H&E Equipment Services, which declined to make a bigger offer. United Rentals climbed $2.75, or 2.5 percent, to $114.72.\n\nBONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stayed at 2.23 percent.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 2 cents to $46.76 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 1 cent to $50.26 per barrel in London.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 110.10 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1717 from $1.1769.\n\nOVERSEAS: Germany's DAX edged 0.1 percent lower and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 gave up 0.4 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.\n\nBusiness Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nMake it your business.

After dramatic moves late last week and earlier this week, stocks appear to have returned to the pattern of small moves that has marked this year.\n\nThe Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 22 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,446 as of 1:41 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 145 points, or 0.7 percent, to 21,880. The Nasdaq composite lost 77 points, or 1.3 percent, to 6,267. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks fell 13 points, or 1 percent, to 1,370.\n\nWalmart did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores. Walmart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $1.56, or 1.9 percent, to $79.42 although it is still up 8 percent since July 10.\n\nOther retailers slipped as well. Amazon fell $9.22 to $968.96 and Macy's lost 36 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $19.78.\n\nBond prices inched higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.22 percent from 2.23 percent.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude fell 17 cents to $46.61 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 6 cents to $50.33 a barrel in London.\n\nThe dollar dipped to 109.83 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1731 from $1.1769.\n\nOverseas, Germany's DAX fell 0.5 percent and the CAC 40 of France shed 0.6 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 also gave up 0.6 percent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 percent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 percent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 percent.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100, "id": 21, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing"}, {"uri":

Most industries are slipping, with some of the biggest losses going to technology and industrial companies, retailers and banks. After dramatic moves late last week and earlier this week, stocks appear to have returned to the pattern of small moves that has marked this year.\n\nKEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8 points, or 0. per cent, to 2,459 as of 10 a.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 90 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 21,933. The Nasdaq composite lost 30 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 6,314. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks remained at 1,384.\n\nWAL-MART HITS A WALL: Wal-Mart Stores did better than analysts expected in the second quarter as shoppers spent more money on its website and more people came to its stores as well. But Wal-Mart stock has rallied over the last month, but Thursday's results weren't enough to keep that going. The stock lost $2.05, or 2.5 per cent, to $78.94 although it is still up 8 per cent since July 10.\n\nSTRIPPED BARE: L Brands, the parent of Victoria's Secret, tumbled after it cut its annual profit guidance because of weakening sales. The company said sales at its older stores dropped 8 per cent, which was worse than it expected. L Brands has been slipping all year because of the difficult business conditions for retailers and its own struggles after it stopped selling swimwear. The stock retreated $2.76, or 7.1 per cent, to $36.19 and it's down 45 per cent this year.\n\nROUTER OUTAGE: Cisco Systems fell $1.10, or 3.4 per cent, to $31.24 after it said sales will decline in the current quarter. It's expecting a decline of 1 to 3 per cent from the $12.4 billion in revenue it reported a year ago.\n\nNOT A RENTAL: United Rentals said it will buy smaller competitor Neff for $25 a share, or $596 million. Neff said earlier this week that it received an offer but did not name the buyer. Neff had previously accepted an offer of $21.07 a share from H&E Equipment Services, which declined to make a bigger offer. United Rentals climbed $2.75, or 2.5 per cent, to $114.72.\n\nBONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note stayed at 2.23 per cent.\n\nENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude fell 2 cents to $46.76 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, shed 1 cent to $50.26 per barrel in London.\n\nCURRENCIES: The dollar dipped to 110.10 yen from 110.16 yen. The euro fell to $1.1717 from $1.1769.\n\nOVERSEAS: Germany's DAX edged 0.1 per cent lower and the CAC 40 of France fell 0.2 per cent. Britain's FTSE 100 gave up 0.4 per cent. The Japanese Nikkei 225 index edged 0.1 per cent lower and Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.2 per cent. In South Korea, the Kospi gained 0.6 per cent.\n\n___\n\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay contributed to this story.

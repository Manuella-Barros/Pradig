But HYPERIMAGE+ goes beyond impressive zoom.\n\nIt unlocks the full potential of every photo by utilising RAW domain image algorithms, a feature rarely seen in this price bracket, to extract maximum quality from every single pixel. This means professional-grade portraits that rival the richness and depth of those shot on DSLRs, low-light shots bursting with detail instead of noise, and telephoto images that remain crisp and vibrant, no matter how far you zoom.\n\nThe realme 13 Pro Series 5G also features advanced AI capabilities including AI HyperRAW Algorithm, AI Pure Bokeh, AI Natural Skin Tone, and AI Ultra Clarity, setting a new benchmark for portrait photography and overall image quality.\n\nThe realme 13 Pro Series 5G isn't just another smartphone launch; it's a statement. It embodies realme's commitment to democratising technology, making cutting-edge advancements like AI-powered imaging accessible to everyone, especially young users who demand the best.\n\nThe 13 Pro Series 5G builds on the legacy of the Number Series, pushing the boundaries of what a smartphone camera can achieve and solidifying realme's position as a leader in mobile photography innovation.", "source": {"uri": "therahnuma.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "therahnuma.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realme", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Realme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_12_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone 12 Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lens"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Optics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periscope", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Periscope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipkart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flipkart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_editing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Image editing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephoto_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephoto lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portrait photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bokeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Used_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Used Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://therahnuma.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/202407043183713.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9707377", "eventUri": "eng-9707377", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 17, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

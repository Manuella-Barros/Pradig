When questioned v by reporters over the statement the senior Congress leader said, \"I say whatever I say in public, never in private.\"\n\nHowever, the BJP has severely criticised Salman Khurshid over his reported comments.\n\nBJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla said, \"Congress party says that it stands with the government of India as far as the issue of Bangladesh is concerned because this is not a political issue and no politics should be done but their leader Salman Khurshid tried to provoke and incite the people of India.\"\n\nHe further said, \"This is another instance of Congress party putting rajneeti above Rashtraneeti. Is Salman Khurshid trying to undermine Indian democracy? Is Salman Khurshid trying to undermine Indian armed forces? This is the same Congress party that has despised 'deshvirodh' when trying to oppose Modi\".\n\n\"What they mean is that the attacks that take place on Hindus of Bangladesh should take place in India. Today Rahul Gandhi must tell us: does he stand by the statement of Salman Khurshid? Is this not an undermining of the Indian democratic institutions? Is this not taking a typical stereotypical opinion of India's population? In the recent past, Congress and its allies were hailing Bangladesh, saying that Bangladesh is ahead of us in different segments and now the same people are saying that nothing is right in Bangladesh. The double face of Congress is out yet,\" he added.\n\nOn Congress leader Salman Khurshid's statement, BJP MP Sambit Patra said, \"He said it during a book release. From Congress' side, he warned that protests and arson could break out in India; what happened in Bangladesh could happen in India. So many other leaders, including Shashi Tharoor, were present there and they in a way supported that statement.

These people are also planning for riots to happen in India. They have also tried to incite violence in different protests. but the administration here is strong and knows how to answer.\"\n\nEarlier, reacting to the statement of Salman Khurshid, Congress leader Gaurav Gogoi said, \"I want the Ministry of External Affairs to remain in constant touch with the leaders of the opposition parties.

We supported Palestine when the issue came, but it was made an issue. Manish Tewari spoke but he did not speak to Hindus in Bangladesh,\" Giriraj said.\n\n\"He (Salman Khurshid) said that India can also have a situation like Bangladesh, I know that he spoke on the instruction of Rahul Gandhi. It should be remembered that whenever someone tried to become Aurangzeb in the country, a Maharana Pratap had also come,\" he added.\n\nComing down heavily on the grand old party, BJP national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla also accused Khurshid of provoking and inciting the people of India with his remarks.\n\n\"Congress party says that it stands with the government of India as far as the issue of Bangladesh is concerned because this is not a political issue and no politics should be done but their leader Salman Khurshid tried to provoke and incite the people of India,\" he said.\n\n\"This is another instance of the Congress party putting rajneeti above rashtraneeti. Is Salman Khurshid trying to undermine Indian democracy? Is Salman Khurshid trying to undermine Indian armed forces? This is the same Congress party that has despised 'deshvirodh' when trying to oppose Modi,\" he added.\n\n\"What they mean is that the attacks that take place on Hindus of Bangladesh should take place in India. Today Rahul Gandhi must tell us: does he stand by the statement of Salman Khurshid? Is this not an undermining of the Indian democratic institutions? Is this not taking a typical stereotypical opinion of India's population? In the recent past, Congress and its allies were hailing Bangladesh, saying that Bangladesh is ahead of us in different segments and now the same people are saying that nothing is right in Bangladesh. The double face of Congress is out yet,\" he further said.\n\nEarlier, Khurshid attracted flak after he said that a violent anti-government protest similar to those in Bangladesh could potentially occur in India, despite the appearance of normalcy on the surface.\n\nSpeaking at a book launch event, the former Union minister said, \"Everything may look normal in Kashmir. Everything may look normal here. We may be celebrating the victory, although some people believe that victory or success in 2024 was perhaps only marginal, and a lot more needs to be done.\"\n\n\"The fact remains that beneath the surface, there is something,\" he said.\n\n\"What's happening in Bangladesh could happen here... the spread in our country prevents things from blowing up in the manner they have in Bangladesh,\" he added.\n\nBangladesh is facing a fluid political situation as protests, primarily led by students demanding an end to a quota system for government jobs, have evolved into broader and violent anti-government demonstrations.\n\nSheikh Hasina arrived in India on Monday evening after tendering her resignation.

It's unfortunate that the Congress is resorting to such anarchist statements to hide its failure,\" Rudy said.\n\nReacting to Khurshid's remarks, BJP MP Sambit Patra claimed that Khurshid has given a warning on the behalf of his party.\n\n\"This is a serious issue. When we are witnessing such a situation in neighbouring countries, the main opposition party Congress wants the same situation in India,\" BJP MP Sambit Patra told reporters outside Parliament.\n\nHe asked if it was a warning from the Congress.

They are not able to win elections, they are venting their frustration by promoting this kind of anarchy and pushing the country towards destruction. This conspiracy of the Congress has been exposed before the public,\" he said.\n\nAsked about Khurshid's statement, Tharoor said, \"You'll have to ask him exactly what he meant, it is not my job to comment on comments of others.\"\n\n\"Generally speaking, the larger message that the Bangladesh experience has given is the importance of democracy, of free and fair elections, transparency, engaging people in the system, making sure all institutions of democracy function fairly,\" he said.\n\n\"When that happens, there will be much less cause of this kind of thing to occur,\" he said.\n\nTharoor also said that India should stand with the people of Bangladesh.\n\n\"Let us hope they will have a chance to determine their own political destiny,\" he said.\n\n\"Student leaders who ignited the protest wanted Muhammad Yunus to preside over the transition...

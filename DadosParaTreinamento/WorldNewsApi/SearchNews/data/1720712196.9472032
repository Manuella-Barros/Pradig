Violence broke out at the Oak Shores day-use area about 5:30 p.m., said Henry Wofford, spokesperson for the Napa County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \u201cThere is no word on what actually sparked this altercation,\u201d Wofford said. \u201cThis fight escalated; it got very large.\u201d When sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived, they found one man with a fatal gunshot wound. Among those who were stabbed, two were flown by helicopter to hospitals, Wofford said. Other victims were taken by ambulance or driven by others to hospitals, he said. The recreation area near the Napa Valley is a popular spot where people come to wade and swim in the lake. It became a chaotic crime scene, with deputies questioning witnesses into the night. \u201cWe still have multiple investigators at the lake talking to victims and witnesses,\u201d Wofford said Saturday night. \u201cWe have a lot of people that we need to talk to. We also have multiple deputies and detectives at local hospitals gathering information right now.\u201d He said he did not immediately have information about the conditions of those who were wounded. Investigators were trying to piece together how the violence started and how many people were involved, Wofford said. No arrests have been made. \u201cWe\u2019re in that mode of, who did what, who\u2019s the victim, and who\u2019s the suspect? So we\u2019re gathering information to determine that,\u201d Wofford said. The investigation is being led by Napa County sheriff\u2019s detectives. Because of the size of the incident, Wofford said, the county\u2019s Major Crime Task Force is assisting in the investigation.", "summary": "<p>Violence erupted at a picnic area on the shore of Lake Berryessa in Napa County.

Charlotte Hamilton\u2019s car was also plundered by 36-year-old Meghann Beckers \u2013 who smashed the vehicle into a tree after attempting to make her getaway. Perth Sheriff Court heard how Beckers stole a Henry vacuum cleaner, a bottle of prosecco, two designer bags and a single Nike Air Max shoe. She was seen staggering away from the smashed-up Vauxhall Vectra car while donning a full-length khaki puffer jacket she had stolen from Charlotte\u2019s home in the North Muirton area on New Year\u2019s Day. The 33-year-old told The Courier that she has been constantly looking over her shoulder since the incident. \u201cI\u2019ve never been anxious in my life but now I\u2019m anxious all the time\u201d, Charlotte said. \u201cI\u2019ve had to go to the doctors about it. It\u2019s awful. \u201cI don\u2019t like where I live anymore. Any noise I hear I\u2019m jumping and I\u2019ve been left on edge. \u201cIt\u2019s not a nice place to stay. You\u2019re looking over your shoulder all the time. \u201cI\u2019ve not been myself for the last six months.\u201d Perth hairdresser says moving neighbour would make her \u2018feel safer\u2019 Charlotte, who works as a hairdresser, hopes Perth and Kinross Council can rehouse Beckers to a new location. \u201cEverybody living in her block is so vulnerable,\u201d Charlotte continued. \u201cOne of her neighbours can\u2019t sleep at night as she loses her keys a lot and buzzes everybody to get back in. \u201cIf she was moved, I would feel safer.\u201d Beckers, of Stronsay Court, North Muirton, pled guilty to stealing from the property earlier this month. She further admitted to driving while unfit through drink and drugs, Beckers is due for early release as part of the Scottish Government\u2019s plan to ease overcrowding in prison. Sheriff Morag Fraser proposed 200 hours of unpaid work and a three-month restriction of liberty curfew. However, Beckers will return to court for sentence next week once she has been released. Charlotte added: \u201cI\u2019m absolutely devastated that she won\u2019t get jailed for this. \u201cShe wrote off my car. It\u2019s just one thing after the other.\u201d", "summary": "Charlotte Hamilton is 'absolutely devastated' that Meghann Beckers has not been jailed.", "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/perth-kinross/5024297/perth-hairdresser-anxious-neighbour-car-theft/", "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/06/Meghann-Beckers-stole-from-neighbour-Charlotte-Hamilton-pictured-with-her-children-29kbcsxko.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:00:05", "author": "Chloe Burrell", "authors": ["Chloe Burrell"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.49}

[+] McKellen (L) as Gandalf with Elijah Wood as Frodo. (Photo by New Line/WireImage) WireImage Who \u2014 or what \u2014 is Tom Bombadil? Lord of the Rings fans have been asking this question for decades, and no one has reached a definite conclusion. Tom Bombadil is J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s most mystifying (and most divisive) creation, appearing briefly in The Fellowship of the Ring, and mentioned again in The Return of the King. Tom Bombadil, however, is a very challenging character to depict on screen \u2014 Peter Jackson opted to cut him from the Lord of the Rings film trilogy entirely. Tom\u2019s absence was met by disappointment by some fans of the book, and relief by others. Jackson\u2019s decision to cut the character is understandable \u2014 Tom\u2019s presence is reality breaking, even in the book. Tom will be seen in season 2 of Amazon\u2019s The Rings of Power, but his drab appearance was instantly dismissed by fans as inaccurate to the spirit of the character. Considering that we know very little about Tom other than his love of vibrant clothes, disgruntled fans had a point. What Role Does Tom Bombadil Play In \u2018The Lord Of The Rings\u2019?

Tom initially comes across as a whimsical fool who is constantly singing, often referring to himself in third person, with a great deal of emphasis on his outfits: \"Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow; Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.\" But there\u2019s more to Tom than his boots \u2014 Tom claims to have been in Middle-earth \u201cbefore the river and the trees,\u201d and to remember \u201cthe first raindrop and the first acorn.\u201d Rather chillingly, the elves refer to Tom as \u201cOldest and Fatherless,\u201d implying that he is more ancient than Gandalf and Sauron, possibly more ancient than the world. While Tom and his wife Goldberry (the daughter of the river) genuinely enjoy the simple life, Tom is no fool \u2014 he holds an encyclopedic knowledge of the forest and understands much of the world beyond it. Tom\u2019s most memorable moment, however, involves the One Ring. Thanks to Tom\u2019s deceptively insightful questions, Frodo opens up to the mysterious man of the woods; upon learning of the incoming darkness, Tom asks to hold the Ring. When Tom places the Ring on his finger, the great creation of Sauron has no effect on him whatsoever \u2014 it doesn\u2019t tempt him, or even turn him invisible. Keep in mind that Gandalf was terrified to touch the Ring, and Galadriel almost transcended into a Dark Lord after wearing it. Tom then flips the One Ring in the air and makes it disappear, just for fun. Tom later reveals that he can see Frodo perfectly well when the hobbit wears the Ring, but gently asks Frodo to take it off, saying, \"Your hand\u2019s more fair without it.\u201d Tom\u2019s chapters mark an odd tonal shift, as if the hobbits have stepped into another book entirely, a fairytale, featuring a Lovecraftian entity of unfathomable power who sings about yellow boots. Tom is mentioned again when Gandalf and Elrond are discussing how to dispose of the Ring, after someone suggests giving it to Tom. Amusingly, Gandalf believes that Tom would find the ring boring, and probably throw it away. Tom is mentioned one more time, after the Ring is destroyed, as Gandalf goes to talk with Tom Bombadil for several days about the historic events that just transpired. Tolkien does not tell the reader what they talked about \u2014 their discussion is left to the imagination. What Is Tom Bombadil? Tolkien\u2019s dense worldbuilding is the stuff of legend, but the author didn\u2019t have an answer to every single question \u2014 for example, Tolkien suggested two separate origin stories for the orcs, and never settled on a canonical explanation. In a letter, Tolkien once described Tom as \u201cthe spirit of the (vanishing) Oxford and Berkshire countryside,\u201d but this was written before Tom\u2019s inclusion in The Lord of the Rings, and might represent Tolkien\u2019s thoughts, rather than Tom\u2019s conclusive identity. Tolkien deliberately withheld details of the character, describing Tom as an \u201cenigma,\u201d but took care to emphasize his unusual power within the story, as well as his reluctance to do anything of importance. It has been proposed that Tom might be the physical manifestation of the creator god, Eru Il\u00favatar, but Tolkien dismissed the theory in another letter. Fans have suggested that Tom is either a \u201cVala\u201d or \u201cMaia,\u201d who are, essentially, the demigods and angels of Tolkien\u2019s world (Sauron, Saruman and Gandalf are all Maia). Dig deep enough into the layered lore of Tolkien\u2019s The Silmarillion, and there\u2019s evidence for both theories, but most fans seem to agree that Tom is some kind of nature spirit who seems to exist beyond Tolkien\u2019s standard classification. Tom Bombadil was also the name of a Dutch doll owned by Tolkien\u2019s son, and some fans have playfully suggested that this is the true identity of the character, that Tom is a toy that exists outside of the book and is therefore the \u201celdest,\u201d having been part of Tolkien\u2019s life before The Lord of the Rings was written. Whatever Tolkien\u2019s true thoughts on the matter, Tom remains an enigma, an inexplicable entity who has sparked many debates and discussions. One could argue that Tom is living the best life out of all the characters in The Lord of the Rings \u2014 he\u2019s powerful enough to shrug off the influence of the One Ring, but spends his days frolicking through his idyllic corner of Middle-earth, gathering flowers for his beautiful wife, singing nonsense songs and bragging about his stylish boots and jacket.

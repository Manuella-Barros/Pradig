{"id": 243242664, "title": "Neil Jordan: \u2018I could have stayed in Hollywood and made Batman 3 but I came back here to make Michael Collins", "text": "The first time Neil Jordan moved to London as a young man, he was forced to sleep rough on the streets, in a park opposite Euston Station. He eventually found a job walking down Oxford Street wearing an advertising sandwich board. It was on a King\u2019s Cross station platform that he encountered a couple of Scottish hippies who told him of a crash pad at the end of the Tube\u2019s Northern Line. Soon, he is joined by an \u201cimposing\u201d Turkish man in a suit, who leads Jordan into the sitting room, to a sofabed. Dressed in a silk robe, the man lifts the duvet of the bed and falls in next to Jordan, surprised that he is still fully dressed. \u201cIrish boys can make quite a bit of money round Piccadilly,\u201d the man tells Jordan. \u201cHow extraordinary, you think,\u201d Jordan writes to his younger self in his memoir Amnesiac. \u201cYou\u2019ve been sold.\u201d When Jordan tells the Turkish man that this is, in fact, a big misunderstanding and no money has actually changed hands, Jordan leaves the house and the tearful, imposing man behind, wondering how many boys that Scottish couple has delivered to clients. He goes back to warming his hands on the fire in Euston Green.", "summary": "<p>The first time Neil Jordan moved to London as a young man, he was forced to sleep rough on the streets, in a park opposite Euston Station.
